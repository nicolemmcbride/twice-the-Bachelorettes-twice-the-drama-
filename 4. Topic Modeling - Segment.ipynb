on like cloud  i know but how do we do it  especially when there is so many men  at the beginning yes  i do not know if they are going to go in  with an idea of maybe who  yeah they aligned with more  watching our journey and then moving forward  i am curious to see which guys we like in the beginning  and see if things will change  because i am sure there is going to be overlap in the beginning  of course because we have to get to know everyone  wait okay so what is your type  i was just about to ask you  i normally go for like guys who are like taller  more athletic  but yeah it really just depends on personality  i have never really dated a guy who has like  made me laugh  so i feel like sense of humor  i know for you is really big too  yeah what about you  like do you have like a type  i have dated them all  i have dated the short kings  the tall ones the funny ones  short kings the plain ones  the smart ones the dumb ones  it really i have done it all  but i want to be with someone who can make a decision  it was clear clayton did not know what the he wanted  and was bouncing bouncing bouncing  and i know what i want  and you know what you deserve too  we have learned so much

gabby by my side  but i just do not know how this is going to work  how are we supposed to navigate feelings  when there is two people involved  if they are saying the same things to us  like what do we do then to both of us  yeah i am sure someone is  going to try and play our ass  i have no doubt mm hmm  i do not trust men  not all of them anyway  after everything with clayton  men have rightfully earned  not being able to be trusted  shall we let us go get ready  but i am a romantic  and i do want a happily ever after  and i hope that i can meet my future husband tonight  dating the same guys  is definitely going to be challenging  this has never been done before  but with two of us  i guess we are just going to have to figure it out  oh my gosh  you look incredible  you look amazing  oh  i am so ready for this chapter in my life  i am ready to have a family  to meet my partner  and i hope that all begins tonight  should we go let us do it  should we go meet our husbands

bachelorettes  i have no idea how this is going to work  so i am going into it with a super open mind  i am just down to see who i connect with  there is nothing i can control with all these unknowns  so i might as well just enjoy it  and see what happens  rachel gabby  i am going to shimmy into your heart tonight  it is going to be a challenge  but i could not have asked for a more wild ride  we are literally going to two women right now  two gorgeous women  they are two different personalities  two different personalities  how is this going to work  i think it is definitely going to be unpredictable  it is going to be a little chaotic i think  i think it is going to be awesome  rachel and gabby are about to arrive  and they will be meeting of the men together  right here tonight  and i am really hoping that they have talked about  how to make this unusual journey work  for the both of them  i guess we will see what they have come up with  but what i do know  is that there

big part of your life  and i only live about an hour from you  so if we end up together in the end of this  maybe you will not have to move too far  oh wow yeah  gabby it is your turn oh are you done  i did not hear a thing  i know you are an excellent nurse  i have broken plenty of bones  so i spent my fair share of time in the hospital as well  so maybe you are my all star nurse that i have never had  yeah  this is so crazy  having all these guys get out of the limo for us  i was nervous coming into tonight  no one knew what this was going to be like  with two bachelorettes  but they are really going out of their way  to make gabby and i feel special individually  i think you two are absolutely wonderful women  i feel so fortunate to join you on this journey  there has never been two bachelorettes before  and i am sure it is not easy to know  who do i hug first  who do i look at first and address  this is surreal they look stunning  i was kind of thrown off a little bit  i did not know who to talk to  so welcome to a night you will never forget  i am here to meet my bachelorette  i mean it has to be extremely intimidating  to walk up to not one of us but two of us  but they are doing a really great job  rachel and gabby okay  oh we have a dancer on our hands  rachel and gabby okay  having two females is interesting  but i think just making sure they have their own  individualized experience is important  it is all about that first impression  oh oh   nice  clearly i am not good at juggling two women  however i promise you  i could be quite the catch  these guys knew that they had to step it up  and i am not disappointed  you got to give it everything you got  because this right here is our time  so let us go out and take it  so far the experiment of two bachelorettes  is going really well  and we are off to an excellent start  let us go that is right  get those boys in there pumped up  let us go  all right here is the deal  this is going to be a long season  two girls yeah  it is going to be fun though  you cannot even imagine something better  so you have got to go at it  with everything you got all right  because right here this is what matters

to be thinking with this head  and not that one  oh we appreciate that  yeah  hayden gets me with the joke  because i am years old  but he makes a nod to clayton  and it is pretty funny  but this is the beginning of our new journey  so it is just the wrong time for it  hear me out i know what it looks like  i am not clayton  gab rach come here  but the guys i feel like  feel like they need to bring up clayton  because it is so fresh  and hearing this clayton stuff  it is kind of like  these guys keep bringing up clayton  and i think gabby and i are  okay with not hearing clayton s name

that you all will never forget  i do not think we could it was i know  they were great we appreciate it  alec definitely made an impression  the choir was probably the most creative entrance so far  and probably the only time we are okay  with hearing clayton s name tonight  i do not know if you all saw i had a little choir come out  they were clutch that is what that was  yeah are you serious  at first i thought my chickens were like a big deal  but now i really do not know how i am going to measure up  oh it is a meatball sub you like meatball subs  i hope you are hungry holy  how many

baby  i feel like all these dudes are trying super hard  to you know have some sort of clever first impression  i know tonight is a very exciting night  and with that comes a lot of nervous energy  so i decided i would show up a little extra grounded  i mean we got a lot of unique characters  in the building  lost your sneaks out there what happened  somebody stole them you know  just before i came in  hopefully you get them back man  yeah right  but not quite sure he put his best foot forward  if you know what i mean  whoa oh my god  wow  is that the blue man group  you are really working that

show them  everything that they need to see  and that is not just outside but that is inside  it is like every day is more nervous than the last day  so i am actually really hairy  so and pale  i was expecting to present myself  but not with a speedo on  is that a sock in there yeah  this guy s cheating put another one in there  put another one in there  this is insane  i am about to go on national tv in a speedo  it covers next to nothing  i appreciate this guys i am going to remember this  the things you do for love right  all right fellas come on downstairs  i will meet you in the

gentlemen  you are going to be competing here today  in a pageant of sorts  for both gabby and rachel  and the prize today it could not be bigger  whoever does the best here today  the guys who show the most heart  the guys who show the most creativity  maybe the most skin just saying  will get invited back to gabby and rachel s place  later tonight for a very exclusive afterparty  the prize of being able to go back to their house  and have a party with the two of them  i mean that is high stakes  i did not get the opportunity to spend  much time with them last night  so i will do whatever it takes  so this is how this is going to work  you will disrobe  and you will show us your look  forward and backwards  oh my yes  whoo hoo  up first logan  sorry to my mom sorry to my dad  sorry to my grammy  uh to my niece  never watch this  some support yes  shoes and socks  i am going to make a fool of myself  but i am going to go all out  this is part of the deal this is how you find love  let the competition begin  up first logan  oh my god  i cannot make eye contact yeah i am like mm  i do not know where to look  today s group date is like a beauty pageant  bachelor style  and the winners get to have more intimate time tonight  so there is a lot on the line  gabby rachel you have any questions for logan palmer  we do  how would your exes describe you  a bit stubborn that is a good word  honest kind  love it  logan has definitely been on my radar  since night one  and today is not any different  i think we are ready for talent  all right ladies  before a relationship turns into a beautiful uh  butterfly  it has to start as a worm  oh my god like a true professional  it was nice with logan going first  to go in there fully confident  hit his worm to perfection  everybody go crazy in the crowd  i think he really set the tone for all of us  to step our games up  let me show you what a real man s body looks like  so many butts  so many dudes who do not skip leg day  it is unbelievable  it is just like me looking in a mirror  when you are wearing a speedo it is nice and snug  you can feel it kind of ride up at times  and you got to get rid of that wedgie  i have never went to a store and thought  yeah let me get the thong one  yeah the one that gets in the crease  whapow  this is something i do not normally do  but it was like bro the stakes were on the line  do you feel like this is something  you could wear regularly  like what if we asked  please no please no  stiff competition  i think we are ready for the talent   today i am just looking for  maybe a little bit of creativity  how much fun can you have with the talent  my mind s been spinning about all the ways  that i could connect with you  about all the things that i could show you  the things that i look for are definitely confidence  effort and how willing you are to kind of commit today  we both want them to show us their personality  oh  i think it will be good to just get a feel of who they are  all right ladies  this talent is very important  i am going to help you guys save a year  on a year fixed mortgage  so let us talk about debts  i am taking notes  jacob is tarzan  dressed like george of the jungle my mortgage broker  i liked it i was into it  i appreciated the glasses  all right next up he makes the best  foot meatball sub in the world  meatball  yeah i am just trying to you know impress the ladies  i think they want to see our personalities  and meatball always comes up with something interesting  got to be patient you will see  what are meatballs  i am scared without some sauce  no  no  no no  god  i honestly think it is going to take  a while for me to eat spaghetti sauce  i mean even just the smells in the room  and then associating that with him  pouring it on his body i was like  it smells just like spaghetti  i am italian but i do not do canned sauce  how many serious relationships have you been in  so what is your beauty routine  hufflepuff or gryffindor  i think with the questions it is going to be important to see  if they are going to answer honestly  and really try and get to know the important parts  kind of core values i think will be important  oh i love johnny oh my god  i think rachel and i find a lot of the same guys attractive  and there is some overlap  but we are allowing ourselves space  to kind of figure it out together  johnny if you could kiss one of us right now  which one would it be  is there a chance that i can pick both  absolutely good answer  oh he is confident  in the speedo  johnny s wearing the pilot hat  have to take notice of that  it was pretty hot  chris  so what is going to happen is  i am going to start a beat for you guys  if when i dribble the ball  you guys could stomp your feet  and when i slap the ball you can clap your hands  right  i am totally crushing it  so what i did was i gave them a little taste  of three things that are really important to me  one of those things is sports  one of those things is music  one thing is leadership  ultimately like i believe i am like the alpha  i am like number one leader  whoo  personally made song right there on the spot  did you have a question for me  honestly no question  gabby and rachel they are going to head back  to their place and they are going to decide  who they are going to invite to this exclusive afterparty  i think it is going to be a tough decision  but to have them pick you now is just like huge  i did all i could with what i had  everybody feels like they did enough  but it is fair game for anybody  i feel like we got to know you guys a little bit better  and this decision is not going to be easy  i will be there  if we can put our glasses higher  let us do a toast to putting your cheeks out there today  what is that  hey someone go get it i got it i got it  today i was in a speedo  in front of other guys jesse palmer  rachel gabby  yeah and after putting it all on the line  there is no question that i want to be on the date card  an envelope  for those lucky guys who get to go  it is a big moment because it is a lot of alone time  aven  logan  brandan  jason   johnny  and colin  you know i kind of left it out there  you know literally like  my ass cheeks were outside today you know  not hearing my name i am just like  is there something i could have done better  i am excited it is going to be a fun experience  honestly like for you guys who are going  the six of you  there is some people including myself  who they do not need a test with right now  who they already know how they feel  but for those of you who are going  it is awesome to you guys so hope you have a good time  how do you feel  it is nerve racking it is  i am excited though  i think we are going to settle in just fine  today went really smoothly  we had so much fun with the men  i am so excited for this to be our first like afterparty  all right boys let us do this  hey  come on in how are you  tonight would be a good night  for us to kind of get an idea of who is more compatible  i do think it is going to be telling  on who may be the guys we vibe with more  we are really excited to have you  this is our first date night  so cheers to you guys  cheers  i am really looking forward  to getting to know jason  he definitely caught gabby and i s eye today  so i am excited to see how he is more on one on one time  thank you  best case scenario i get a kiss  maybe two  how is it going for you though  i wanted to ask you  two bachelorettes like this is crazy  how do you feel about that like  yeah with both of us  it is been wild to just like do this  yeah yeah i do not know  i feel like i should be upfront  to be honest like when i got here  like i felt like a connection to gabby  yeah and like you know i truly like  think you are the most like genuine  and like beautiful no you believe me  you are fine no like  no i am not trying  yeah i just want to tell you that  thank you thank you  yeah i can feel that  you are like a truly genuine like person  yeah  i was a little disappointed  this is the first conversation  but he is someone  that is basically going to be for gabby  of course it is disappointing but i know that there is  going to be men where i have amazing connections  so i really hope it starts to turn around tonight  how was today it was wild  yeah that was so uncomfortable  welcome to the life i love it yeah  of minimal clothing  i give you girls props that is crazy  well you exude confidence  really i think so  love that word  exude confidence exude yeah  so i know i kissed you on the cheek today  but i think i kind of want to retry that  is that okay with you yeah  come here  so i am a little unsure about where i stand tonight  i mean we are open to both exploring similar connections  but i am still trying to find my footing  so i have travelled to almost every state in the you s  really i think i have like  or left  at this point i am just like i might as well  just do the last few  absolutely  it definitely was not going the way i expected it to  it really feels like these guys are  just having friendly small talk conversation  that you could have with your cousin  i am a huge harry potter fan  i listen to all the audibles watch the movies  i love the audible because the narrator is incredible  and he does every character  it is like it is it is excellent  i do feel like these guys are holding back with me  i do not know where they stand  and i want to hand out a rose tonight  so someone is got to step up their game  how did you feel like today with like  really pushing everyone outside their comfort zone  how do you feel i felt good um  one thing i have noticed  yeah about you  oh tell me oh yeah  i have been paying attention tell me  very brave  i am brave i think you are brave  why is that i do  well for you to like jump back into this process  mm hmm like i still believe in it  that is like incredibly brave  thanks  so when i get my name called up first  to do a little dance in my speedo  i figured i will take a page out of your book  awesome so yeah yeah  i like it yeah  and i think we did have a nice connection as well  yeah i want to see more of it  i do too i am really glad you are here   and not a bad kisser either  you do not think so huh  it is more brownie points  my night had been disappointing  but i think logan turned things around  he is really funny  he really put himself out there today  we have really fun banter  and he is very cute  so we will see  i really like logan  that is one thing that i really was drawn to about you  was um  like you are someone who makes people smile and laugh  but there is like a whole ocean under that  yeah  i just want to say like i do recognize that  i feel like you have been like really sweet to me  really yeah  can i kiss you  yeah  logan and i had a really good conversation  he is super fun very charming so i think i could  definitely see myself giving him a rose  i am kind of nervous about the two roses there  a little bit  yeah there is two girls  there is has to be a point in this where they are  both going to like the same person  yeah things will get messy i have no doubt about it  right now who would your rose go to  yeah i do not know  logan and i had like good banter and like  kind of easy connection and he was like  he is a cool guy yeah  um i do have to tell you something  what i kissed logan  okay do you like him i do  yeah mm hmm  like kind of your type  he is sweet yeah i do yeah  i like him  yeah  you know my heart kind of dropped a little bit  i think that logan is exploring both sides  which is what we are asking of the men  but i already felt like i had a really strong connection  with him and i was excited to see where things go  so it feels weird  i just i want to get  where your head s at too yeah  because if he is someone you are like super  super interested in like i will completely be like  you know yeah yeah yeah  yeah  yeah hmm  it is a weird place for rachel and i right now  you know we are both exploring  both sides of our relationships  hello  ladies hi  everything s just way harder than i expected  and this is like kind of the first time  we are figuring it out  tonight i want to give this rose to someone  who made me feel really special and made me laugh  logan will you accept this rose  i will thank you  okay i am not sure how to pin it on  thank you you are welcome  rose looks good on you kid  yeah i know today was such a crazy day  and i have loved getting to know each and every one of you  tonight but i am going to give this rose  to someone who surprised me tonight  so  johnny will you accept this rose  of course i will  rachel feels very strongly about logan  i want to be able to give her that space  in order to nurture  it is truly not worth stepping on rachel s toes  in this scenario  thanks for being our first  date night yeah  two bachelorettes is causing some hurdles  that we did not really know to even plan for  and i am not sure how we are going to figure it out  gentlemen how we doing what is going on  hey we doing all right good to see you

jordan is about his career in race car driving  yeah the stakes are high today  there is going to be a rose so it is a big deal  lot of pressure  just kidding jordan you will do fine  we are haulin  give it a little bit give it a little bit  whoo yeah give it a little bit  yeah throw the hands up  whoo  i am like blinded by my long hair  i feel like i want to hold it for you  but i do not know if i should do that or not  i have something really fun planned for jordan today  it is something that gets your adrenaline  going a little bit and i am excited  to give jordan a little taste of my brand of adventure  no way  no way  have you ever done this before  no oh man i am in for it  i am in for it are you kidding me  zero gravity means you basically get to float around  like an astronaut without going to space  starting to freak out a little bit  i am nervous  i am you know i am scared of heights  zero gravity terrifies me  you get to be in my element for a day  holy cow  rachel you know her being a pilot she can handle it  i think i would feel a little safer if she was flying it  oh now it is getting real  boarding the plane i am like  shocked by the fact that jordan  is having such a scared  strong reaction because i mean  he is a race car driver  it is crazy  is this crazy yes  are you scared yes  are you no  of course not  cannot do the heights  i can do the speed  and i feel a little nervous obviously  but she is going to be right by my side  and i cannot wait to share it with her  oh my god  oh my god i got you  you got me  oh  you are stronger than me  how did you do that  i do not even know i do not know how to stop  heights make me nervous  if i was alone i would be terrified  but rachel and her calming ability  it helped it is helping calm my nerves  are you feeling sick are you all right  no i am good yeah  i did forget about the world today  and i was just super grateful to her for choosing me to be  on this date with her and have this experience with her  so yeah i forgot about everything  i did not care about the guys in the house  i did not care about anything at all  but spending time with her and having this experience  i think today up in zero gravity  we really really found a connection  i feel only excitement for tonight  and now it is just time to build  on what we have already  so who here has spent time with my girl so far  i have not  which one is your girl which one is your girl  i am honestly open to both of them  i am like rubbing my hands together at the opportunity  to like get some one on one time for sure  because i plan to be here the way  but ultimately like there is definitely  some deal breakers for me like especially if i am talking  about one person who i would spend the rest of my life with  like for me it would be a deal breaker  if we got down to the final four  which i plan to be in and we go into  fantasy suite and we have this sexual experience  and then the person who i am most interested in  decides that she is going to have sex  with multiple people and feel it out  that would be the situation where i would go okay i m out  there is no chance  whoa  what are you talking about  i really do not think that we should be talking about  fantasy suites at all at this point  i think it is a little weird that chris is thinking  that far ahead  it is a little presumptuous  and disrespectful to gabby and rachel  you are kind of talking about something   that is way down the line  yeah this is a long time away  we kind of need to focus on  what is in front of us right now  chris is bringing up fantasy suites  it is kind of a jerk y move  i am sure he is going to because a wildfire of  wow  is not this gorgeous  this is absolutely gorgeous  i truly had such an incredible day  jordan i think was the perfect choice for this date  thank you  tonight i am really excited to get to know jordan more  i mean we have a playful chemistry  and i want to see if it can go further than that  i am really hopeful  i of course love the fact that we got  to experience something for the first time together  we do have such different passions  but in a way it is so similar  and i think for me that is been something  that is been hard for me to find in a partner  someone who shares like a passion  and i noticed that with you right away  it is been hard to explain what i do to most people  because most people do not know what i do  they hear drag racing they have no idea  the fact that you know you are a pilot  and the fact that you understand that feeling  that we get before we fly  or before we drive mm hmm  it is a little you know easier to explain to you  because i know you get it and you get me  absolutely yeah  you know i am cool with everybody here  but there are some people you know  even here i feel like chris you know  you will say like subtle things you know  like what you will say like  subtle things in a group environment  like what  you spoke on like a fantasy room subject  a what be clear what did i say  it was about if you are not first  in that fantasy room and you are last  you would not want to be there  yeah  my personal perspective and i hold true to this is  if you are in a situation where there is four people  and there is four people invited to this fantasy suite  and the female in this situation  has sex with someone else i would not be interested  in that person being the person i am with  okay i have a question because this is  what kind of happened last season  would you be would you vocalize that to them  before fantasy suites  during fantasy suites or after fantasy suites  good question it would be dependent on the situation  because something that is also well you would not know  the situation listen listen listen  you would not know the situation  let me finish speaking please  for me what i am not interested in  is you guys way of going about this process  when you talk about fantasy suites  you are there because you are in love  when you are at fantasy suites  you are there because you are in the final four  that is the only guarantee so it is a game  if you are there then that is a game  that is a game to you that is a game dude  ah gosh darn it i did not say that  like i did not even use the term  did not he  may i speak to you look at me  look at me  why are you telling me you are really  like allowing someone to speak like  you have this like this this approach  of organization  no you are trying to control it though  so i have let you speak i have let him speak  i am just saying the way you saying it  is still rubbing us wrong  it is rubbing you wrong  the way chris speaks is all about control  he is very kind of intense  maybe you do not mean to deliver a condescending tone  but in general that is what it sounds like to people  he is drawing a lot of lines in the sand that  kind of surprised a lot of the guys  any time that you have a premeditated thought of  you won t do this unless that  that is a form of control and that is manipulative  this could be our queen this could be  the mother of our children and this could be  someone we spend the rest of our lives with  you cannot have preconditions to love  it is just the form of control that a lot of men just  do not realize that they do that damages good women  well i would love to know more about your family  you kind of mentioned your siblings  yeah okay  yeah so um i have a younger brother  mm hmm  and then i have a younger sister  her name is morgan  she is i believe right now  okay  and yeah you know just growing up  being the older brother we went through  a tough situation when we were younger  i mean  my parents got divorced when i was years old  a lot of things kind of went through me  i had to kind of take care of my little brother and sister  yeah how was that  a lot of communication ran through me  oh wow  and it forced me to grow up really quickly  because i used to take pride in them being together  like i really really enjoyed having a family unit   for the first date got it right here  this one s from rachel  yeah  have an amazing week wish you all the best of luck  and i hope to see you all at the next rose ceremony  later fellas thanks jesse  thanks jesse see you  i already know there is  an amazing connection with rachel  i want to keep like developing that relationship  so i am hoping for a one on one  all right fellas  i am all in on rachel there is no question about it  so i really want this one on one  like more than anything  zach  today is the beginning of our love story  love rachel  attaboy my boy  whoo  i see you man how you feeling man  i am feeling great like pretty speechless man  pretty speechless yeah  yeah she is one for one for kicking people out so  ooh ooh  you definitely want to hear your name on that card  for the person that you are kind of focused on  so yeah i was hoping it was going to be me  unfortunately it was not  i think it is about time to get ready for that date  these one on one dates i think there is  definitely a new amount of pressure  i thought jordan v was coming back  after that first one on one date  he did not  so you never know what could happen  so you know you got to be on you are a game  if zach does not come back  i think every single one on one date card  we are going to be praying that it is not our name  zach has a great connection with rachel  oh my god let us go  but at the same time like she had a connection  with jordan the first night  and then bam he is going home  she might be using these one on ones  as like i need to know right now  if i am going to like him or he s going home  today i am really excited for my date with zach  the first time we talked we had immediate chemistry  but i do not really know that much about him  so today i really want to see  if zach is here for me  there is a rose on the line tonight  and i think the stakes are pretty high  oh my god hello  how are you doing  we have a really fun day planned  are you ready to head in i am excited  all right let us do it  but i actually do not know what is happening  i have enlisted the help  of someone very special today  hey hello  ooh  hi how are you doing  zach this is karamo  how are you doing hello  pleasure to meet you nice to meet you  he is one of my favorite tv stars  you might know him from queer eye  but he is also an author a relationship expert  oh babe you do not got to go  through the r sum and a culture expert  listen this night is for you two  i had to make sure that i come here  to support her  to make sure that your relationship  jumpstarts on the right foot  listen let us pop some champagne though  you know what i mean come on please  i have been rooting for rachel  from the first time i saw her on the last season  because she deserves love  i mean this is the first test of a gentlemen  can you pop the champagne  oh let us see  okay okay man  no i love rachel so much  so the fact that i get to set up  a date for her tonight  that i know is going to be magical  and that is going to surprise her feels really good to me  all right so let me tell you all  what i have planned  so in my eyes you are a starlet  beautiful gorgeous  everything that we know about old hollywood  that woman that we all admire  so i actually have figured out a way to get you all  into a very exclusive movie premiere tonight  i am giving you all that full hollywood red carpet treatment  amazing oh my god  yeah like a good date i have never done it  i have never been  never been to a movie premiere  no i am so excited  i feel so good  the best part is having zach by my side  here you go my love thank you  this is a great date so far  i am excited  today the guys are just at home  so to be able to strengthen these connections  i would like more time with them  hi we know her  oh  whoa hi  yo how is  oh my god you guys just do this all day  so cas  what is so scary about falling in love  is that you are making yourself so vulnerable  surprise  i do not want to date someone who is not sure about me  hi  so i am really excited to see  who shows effort  and who is showing they are here for me   i know this can work  i am so excited for it to work  oh my god surprise  what is up nothing  it seems like you are enjoying yourself  this is nice what do you do all day  this yeah  we eat food work out  we like throw the football  tan like this is most  not throw the football  yo ethan throw the football  ooh whoa  oh fumble  i know what that means every time you miss the ball  it is a shot uh oh  hold up this went crazy  oh god i do not  oh that looked  like it was actually coming in hot  oh meatball  oh yeah oh there it is  that was a nice redemption  i do not want to play anymore  i did not want to play to start  it is kind of frustrating  the men are not being  super forward with me  good guy that is pretty nice  oh you like it bro i got this  from mexico bro when i went on a wedding trip  um so  there is some guys who are just kind of proceeding  like blas  whatever i get to date two girls  that is not what this is about  and the lack of effort is a decision at this point  like it just does not show initiative  it does not show that you are ready  oh thank you you have a great day  i feel like i am giving so much to them  and like they are not giving everything back  my expectations are so high  that i am terrified to be let down  okay i am going to be real with you  so there are two women in the house now  like there is gabby as well  how do you know if you have feelings for her  like is she completely off the table for you  it was crazy because i had this feeling with you  almost right out the gate  i felt that there was sparks or chemistry  or whatever you want to call it  and i just knew in that moment  it did not matter that there were two bachelorettes  like i i felt something with you  and um good answer  girlfriend if this is not the one  like literally i am happy  that i am sending you on this date  this is going to be good thank god  because i was like  who else we going to get out here if you fail  so this is great that you are doing so well  oh my exactly  this is a great day  rachel is beautiful and amazing  this whole experience has been  something i could not even have imagined  there is a lot of emotion and a lot of feelings  and new experiences  come on out  ow  right we kind of match  roar ooh  it is not easy to open up  and she is made it you know so much easier  for me as i am doing stuff that is out of my comfort zone  oh my yes  let me see look at you  i think everything we have done so far today  has made me feel really confident  about moving forward with rachel  and really exploring each other  oh yes  oh my god oh yes  tonight is a big special vip movie night for them  i cannot wait to see them strut their stuff  on the red carpet  three two one come on out  oh oh my  you look good look at you  you like it oh my no i love it  ooh i love  he loves it  you look great you look very handsome  you look like a movie star  thank you seriously  i think this might be it  i think this is it  this is it this is it yeah  wow  i have to say you both look gorgeous  this is what i wanted  these two look really good together  if all it takes is for you to look good  to say it is a match  my baby this is a match  right now i am just kind of in my head  going to the house today was kind of weird  nobody really showed initiative  and i was hurt  i was  i deserve to be loved  but do i deserve to be loved  by the person i want to be loved by  because it seems like the people  that i wanted to love me did not  and i do not want to like give my whole heart  to someone just to have it like broken again  but i know that it is like  with great risk comes great reward  someone at the door  i think because of everything  that i have been through  i just feel my feelings so deeply  and it truly is a blessing and a curse  because i think it hurts way more   ah there is the card  oh damn ooh  it is scary doing this like week after week  i do not know if i have the capacity  to either keep breaking people s hearts  or to potentially have mine broken  erich  who said three s a crowd love gabby  i am ecstatic  and i am not going to sleep tonight  i am super pumped  i think it does take kind of the right person  to know how to love me  we are in a limo drinking champagne  only fitting to go to a movie premiere  in hollywood whoo  oh my  me and you  no wait  oh my god  let us go oh my god  let us go what  rachel zach look here let us go  let us go  rachel over here  oh my damn  yeah oh my god  wow  look here rachel look here  rachel hey zach  this is so incredible  having zach by

uncle john  congratulations  oh that  oh my god  that moment we shared was something special  and i got to see you know what her life was back then  and that is something that not everyone gets to see

you know  with my dad  and you know one crazy thing  about this whole you know journey is you know  he he was an aspiring pilot  he wanted to become a military pilot  he loves planes so much so  that when we were kids  he would just drive us to any airport  stop  and we would sit are you ser  in the park like a parking lot of an airport  and he we would just watch planes take off and land  and he would name every single one of them  i did that with my dad you are kidding me  no i am literally like tearing right now  you actually did that like yes  that is  i have never heard or met anyone that is done the same thing  that is this is literally  this is wild  oh my gosh this is just so crazy  i feel like i kn  like have spent weeks with you already  yeah this has been so incredible  this has been absolutely  one of the best nights of my life  same  tonight was incredible  i really do believe that we really did start  the beginning of our love story  and  i think rachel could be my future wife  i have a surprise  more surprises yeah  do you want to dance  this is crazy to say out loud  and actually think about considering how early it is  but it is very real  what is going on it is very real  i am falling for her  i am falling for her really really hard  um yeah  zach will you accept this rose  absolutely okay good  thank god absolutely  i am so relieved  coming into tonight was seeing  if zach and i could connect emotionally  and to see him get emotional seeing his family  i definitely think we have  an emotional connection a physical connection  to be able to be blessed to be in this position  to find love again  and to be experiencing it  with like like unconditional love  with someone like zach next to me is just  truly like so special  this is all about finding love  and it just feels like  a really like beautiful start  to like what could be something really amazing  my journey thus far it has not been easy  going to the house yesterday obviously backfired  i left feeling upset and sad   wondering if these guys are truly interested in me  but today i am just looking forward  to spending time with erich  we always have a good time together  this is a big day  this is like the make or break  i am really excited  but also a little apprehensive  will he be able to accept me for me  hi hey gabby hey  how are you good  you look good today it is good to see you  thank you you do too  hi  i feel like i live here  erich s date card said three s a crowd  so who is the third you know yeah yeah  i am like getting kind of nervous now  yeah you should be  the legend  oh hey kid how you doing  you guys i think you know who this is  this is my grandpa  america s grandpa  who are all these guys grandpa  they are all my boyfriends  i was shocked  i was like no there s just no way  have you got a date for me  come on this is about me  oh wait a minute  it is really about to be a two on one  with like a family member  this early  like it is unprecedented  yeah all right shall we  bye bye bye  bye  so you know what we are doing buy i do not  i do know i do not think that is fair  i know it is early  but i think it will be nice to be able to see  how erich interacts with my family  let us hit it bye  this is really beautiful country i have got to admit  i know it is so green here  grandpa john is really great in so many ways  he is been married for plus years  so he is a great guy to have around  and he really loves me  i really appreciate that  so my grandpa s approval on erich  will mean the world to me  so now you are living here in california  yeah i just moved  you should come hang out with me in santa monica  what is in santa monica  beaches good looking chicks  grandpa you are a pervert  i have never been on a first date  where somebody is grandpa s been there  so it is definitely not natural  but he is a really funny charismatic guy  it is special that he is here  where do you think we are  i have no freaking idea where we are  oh what is this  welcome  thank you  my name is kirsha  i am going to be your sound ceremony host today  before we get started  i am going to do an energetic clearing on you  which just helps to release  any negative energy s auric field  one of my favorite things is a sound bath  because it is very grounding  i would like to invite you to turn around  it is just what i need to have a reset  to get myself out of my head  i think i have personally been  a little overwhelmed these last couple days  we are going to start  with an intention setting ceremony  i can go first  okay  um i would like to set an intention of moving forward  in this journey with confidence  despite any fears i may have  because i truly believe  that the risk is worth the reward  being the bachelorette i have had so many doubts  i have been scared as hell  feeling that i am not good enough  to be in this role  my intentions is presence  just being here in the moment  being in love is so scary  because you are trusting someone with your whole heart  so trusting myself and my heart with erich  i think is a big step for me  john you are welcome to rejoin us  whenever you feel ready  rejoin us how  oh jeez  what on earth  interesting  that was an interesting experience yeah  i thank you for placing trust in me  to guide you through this ceremony  i mean at my age  any new experience is a good experience  not something that i would necessarily  ever have to duplicate again  okay where is my beer  wow  grandpa i think maybe we should do teams  let us see  hi  do you want to bowl with my grandpa and i  and my date sure  are you me  this is julie julie  hi julie how are you i am grandpa  i am grandma  so i got a date ooh that is right  we got this  okay here we go  do not get any ideas  are you me  i am too old to have ideas   so far today has been great  and it really feels like a normal family day  erich is rising to the occasion  oh  he seems like he is into me  oh my god  it did not feel like a normal first date  where i felt like i had to impress him  it seemed like he was really down with everything  just really easy to be around  this day has been like a lot of fun  it is been like  senior citizens bowling tour literally  yeah  yeah  i think we have to have a moment  away from whatever that is  i agree  there is nothing like making out in a bowling alley  with a bunch of teenagers and old people  all right we will keep it pg  it does make you feel like a teenager  it is kind of fun  i was lucky that we just like have this connection  we hit it off because i do not know  if i have had that with rachel  today with erich was definitely as good  as i hoped  he did great with my grandpa  you have got it  i am like i come out of this and i have a new grandma  he is like i got a hotel room  right  this week has been hard  oh my god  i know is not this crazy  this is unbelievable  i have been in my head questioning everything  is there another table  that grandpa john s going to pull up with  yeah  but i am feeling like overall good  i know i do really have a connection with erich  and i might not be perfect tonight  but hopefully he is patient with me  because that is the only thing i can really ask for  i had an amazing day  me too cheers  some parts were interesting for me  yeah same  like you really do make this so easy  and like i really just want to value the time  that that we have to see if if there is  you know a deeper connection if that is a possibility  yeah yeah and like i know  i feel like we are kind of on the same page  where it is like yeah  it might take a minute  to get there but right  to know the possibility s there  like that is what is exciting to me  yeah totally  a lot of relationships is effort  which people take for granted yeah  but it is easy to give up  yeah and just to  to just not like fight through it  and growing up you know you see your parents  yeah and that was one thing  my mom said she is like  i will always fight for him no matter what  and i mean that  have do they like ever not get along  obviously yeah have you yeah  they fought all the time well i do not know like  how much they like show you  so like my my dad is this like larger than life  big personality  like the most stubborn son of a bitch  you will ever meet  and my mom is this like  the hardest working person i have ever met  in my entire life mm  and they have this like deep love  i mean they are absolutely soul mates  they are just like the best team  yeah that i have ever seen and  yeah i know it is a lot to ask for  but it is that is like that is what i want  yeah i think it is important too  because i think i still have like fears built in  that i constantly have to like sit down  assess and fight  and i am reserved to share that with people  because i have been hurt so many times  like by a parent yeah  and i think like that is kind of the hardest love  to not ever have received yeah  growing up my mom kind of we are estranged  i do not have a relationship with her  i am sorry she like no that is okay  um she definitely did the best she could  but the second i moved out of the house  she like wiped her hands like clean  so it i mean it is  like i obviously get emotional talking about it  yeah but it  i will like maybe never know  what it is like to like have a mother s love  and it is something like that is hard and i will miss  just give me a second   paris  ooh to have two incredible dates  to start the week  there is nothing i would want more  than to be on a plane to go see rachel in paris  i mean that just validates  she really wants to get to know me  really wants to talk to me  i want that one on one time  so i hope i get a date with ms gabriela  oui oui oui oui  so gabby and rachel they thought  long and hard about this  and for this first amazing date in paris  gabby wants to spend it with  jason  wow damn  ooh and rachel s decided  that she wants to spend her date  with tino  ooh yes sir  tino tino  all right so tino jason say your goodbyes  car s waiting for you outside it is taking you to the airport  you are flying to paris to meet the ladies  good luck fellas  and for the rest of you go pack your bags  wheels up in an hour  i will see you all in france  yeah let us go  let us do it all right guys  whoo whoo hoo hoo  yes let us go  so fired up right now  i am like i have been dying for like  this one on one time  this is so sick cannot get over it  i got a one on one with gabby  dream girl dream city  i am feeling it in my stomach  just like butterflies  jason got the one on one  wish that could have been me but for now  we are headed to france  i do not even know how to feel right now  like this is crazy  what do i know about france  they eat a lot of croissants there  and it is a good love story  to fall in love in france  like we always have paris  au revoir bachelor mansion  i am coming france  i am coming  paris is romantic  there is something in the air  there is little tiny cobblestone streets  beautiful architecture  so much history  it is so beautiful  so i feel incredibly grateful  i cannot believe we are in paris  i know  especially after last week  the last rose ceremony was the most unexpected thing  i really just did not see it coming at all  it is just really difficult to be so vulnerable like  offering someone a rose standing up there  and having them tell you no multiple times  i just  like rejection just hurts  that is the thing like yeah  in that moment i am like no one wants to date me  like why am i here mm hmm  it was really like that was probably my  i thought i had my lowest moment  yeah that was my lowest moment  hopefully yeah  yeah  at the last rose ceremony three men rejected my rose  it is really like hurtful and embarrassing frankly  to have that happen  it really was the most embarrassing thing  that is ever happened to me  you feel rejected and you think  well what is wrong with me  you just start to question  why anyone accepted your rose  it has been a challenge for gabby and i  to have our insecurities brought out  as being compared to one another  there is always like high highs after the low lows  and i am glad it happened when it did  mm hmm because i feel like i have  so much more room and space for other men now  that you know are here for you  yeah  i have a huge fear  that the men in my group  might not even be interested in me  and will want to switch over to pursue gabby  or that they might feel like  they are in the loser group  oh no i am nervous did you just see them  no  paris is supposed to be romantic  i do not want my insecurities to ruin everything  this date with tino might be  the most important date i have had  hopefully we are able to kind of get this back on track  oh i see him  you do  because if it does not i just do not really  see a point in moving forward  yo we are in france right now  fellas jesse  hey what is up  welcome to france  yeah  anything  anybody speak french  no uh  better to go back to english  yeah  welcome to the port city  of la havre france  we are a very short distance away  from the incredible city of

happened  really yeah  yeah because where else have you been  i have been to france actually but not paris  oh  the last time we went i was with all my girlfriends  and we have a picture in front of the eiffel tower  there is like eight of us with matching paris shirts  yeah yeah  this is my first time in paris  i am so excited  jason is a man of few words  that is one of the first things i noticed about him  and one of the things that i was really attracted to  he is never been to the most romantic city  so i feel grateful that i get to share that with him  but i also hope today he could try in his own way  to break out of his she will a little more  we need hats bonjour  hi  how are you fine and you  good  they are going to measure our heads  yes i am so stoked for this  is

paris and getting to explore  such a romantic city in the rain  with literally like  the most amazing girl i have ever met  i mean i am just like i am on cloud nine  i just i cannot imagine a better day  to see her get hurt last week by people sitting on the fence  or not as sure as me like it is just like it sucks  i hate seeing her sad  she is the most stunning girl i have ever  gotten to spend time with  and  after you beautiful  i do not want her to ever not be happy  bonjour  it is weird it is been so long like  kind of being like this like with somebody  really  like this like excited about it yeah  why  because you are so charming  ooh i like it tell me more  have you been told that you are charming  no  you make the rainy days in paris  more rainy sunny sunny  you bring sunshine to rainy days in paris  oh oui oui cheers  i was hoping to have a date with gabby  away from a big group  and the fact that the stars aligned  for gabby and i to come to paris together  and get this date is everything to me  that one this one  no no it is going so fast go go  jason and i just have fun goofing around  and act like kids together  which i personally love  jason is somebody that i can kind of feel their warmth  and we do not always have to be talking  but i do kind of need him  to open up a little bit more to me  because we do not have a ton of time  to learn about each other  and that is what these one on one dates are for  this is like the cutest little street  oh my god i love little bookstores like that  kissing tino in the rain  i feel excited again after a really hard week  i see why they call paris the city of love  it does something to you  i cannot explain it  i really do not want this day to end at all  it really feels like a fairy tale  how was your date  it was good what did you guys do  we tried on berets carousel  oh we got hats that was second  did they measure your heads  yes she is a medium he is an extra large  i am a medium small  i got like a star hat  gabs do you have to go to the bathroom  yeah okay  okay good okay bye  please move sorry sorry  okay oh my god  tell me how was it  no you go first  i am in love  oh  what do you  it went well man  like it went really well  i have not had that much fun in a while  yeah like she is just fun  and like effortless to be with  yeah  yeah i am feeling good about it so  same here  hmm i love that  me too  it really was like magical  but that is so good  yeah it is but we did not get into anything deep  mm hmm same we like talked about  surface level stuff  so i am excited to just like know more about him  but tell me about you  i already liked him so much yeah  we had such a great connection  and then today it was just so amazing  mm hmm and i am so scared  yeah i was not  expecting today to go as go like  paris is just insane  it does something to you  yeah it really does mm hmm  but it is okay to be scared  like i feel like he likes you so so much  tino and i had such an amazing date  i think it was absolutely perfect  and so now i am feeling really strong feelings for him  and i am not sure how to handle them  to feel feelings this strong this early on  it is terrifying because i have been through  so much rejection in the past  and like if tino does the same thing to me   that would be ten times worse  of course i do not want that to happen  so tonight i am really looking to see  if we do fit into each other s lives  because i want to make sure that going forward  every single rose i hand out is to someone  that i genuinely could see being my husband  before we jump in  i know the rose ceremony was hard last week  and did not go smoothly by any means  no  no thank you for checking in  it truly was like the hardest moment  i have had as the bachelorette  and ah it is like so hard to talk about  it is like you stand up there  and you are so vulnerable  and to have people just so blatantly  not care about how it would affect me  and i think it has to do with me being like  a little insecure i guess  because no one really wants to feel  yeah like they are rejected  and obviously i have had some like  tough relationships in the past  i mean it is it is never easy  like hearing any sort of news like that  and i am sure that was you know uncomfortable  or you know probably a little bit scary  yeah it was definitely it was tough  but i did kind of want to talk today about  aligning like on career and family  because it is kind of like  a reason my last relationship failed  mm hmm i had a boyfriend  who just was not supportive of my career  which is a really big fear of mine  i feel like when people first meet me  it s oh you are that s so cool  this is like a job that not a lot of people have  and then when you get into it  and they start to realize like okay  at least my last boyfriend when things got serious  he would get like really scared  like he would be like well pilots cheat  and you will be away  and there will be times where i will have to  take care of the kids for like a day that you are gone  and you are not always going to be there  right and of course kind of  reaffirmed what everyone is always told me  which is that when you are a woman in this field  mm hmm you cannot have  the traditional family life  but i think it can work  i totally understand that  i mean that is  it is really tough  in my industry a lot of people get married young  and then like the tolls of long hours and stuff like that  yeah  but your passion for your career is just  like it lights me up inside  because like i need somebody who has that kind of devotion  like but equal to like the relationship working  and that is what like i want to be for somebody  and you do want a family  yeah  is that a deal breaker for you  no i do  that is something that is like  really important for me  it is kind of what i was hoping  for you to say yeah  it does make me really happy i could not agree more  i mean this was like  a conversation i was like really scared of  because like i do not i do not know  like i mean you could have said  like oh i don t want a family  and you know we just had like an amazing day  and i would have been like i know  oh wow that is a lot yeah no i really do  so like i really want a family  and i really want to get married  like i really want both  i mean i cannot i cannot like promise you  it will always be easy mm hmm  but i totally see it being possible  like i always had parents  that both worked full time  and made sacrifices and commitments  to me and my little brothers  i mean there was so much partnership when i was  growing up where they always supported each other  that is like the only thing i know  my dad did work the long hours but he would get up early  to make us lunches and stuff  and like that those kind of little things  really speak on like how i am programmed  that there is always a way to make it work  yeah  and i mean with the right person  i mean there is just no other way around it  yeah i can i really can tell you are serious  and i really think i needed today  to get back on track and truly feel like  this is working for me  and i really really do  i really like you and that scares me  because it is really early and i want to make sure  that we are on the same page  i would not keep accepting roses from you  if i was not like willing to go go to war for it  and did not see that potential  that means a lot  happy to say it  it is terrifying for me too so  yeah i know  it is it is really scary  i truly did not know  if i could get to this point last week  you truly have turned this around for me  and this is the easiest rose i have had to give   so tino  will you accept this rose  always  today has been absolutely perfect  and tonight somehow has even been better  because this rose means that she sees a future with me  and i really do think i was meant  to find this girl and make her happy forever  so it is like falling in love with rachel  is coming faster than i could have ever imagined  this is perfect  it really is  paris with tino was definitely  the restart that i needed  i had high hopes for our date  but all my expectations were exceeded  he is just so amazing  i think i am definitely going to fall in love with tino  what do you guys think of the ship  i like this  yeah  we got our own bar here we got our own  bachelor pad down here kind of  yeah yeah  kind of like a little clubhouse  yeah we have our own rachel clubhouse  balcony over there  we can kind of go outside if we want  yeah  the reality is like  now it actually starts  yeah definitely a new chapter  and now there is nine of us nine of us  we all get to be intentional with gabby  the date card  i got it  it is really interesting to see this group  compared to rachel s because  i think we are significantly more competitive  i do not know how the group dates are going to work  but i think it is going to get intense very quickly  because we are all laser focused on gabby  nate  kirk  quincey  erich  michael  mario  spencer  and johnny  love conquers all but not without a fight  love gabby oh  oh  big fight something competitive  not without a fight  we are fighting for gabby s love  yeah i mean  i am about to bring it i guess  whatever we are doing but  let us see some blood yeah  we are probably going to get down and dirty tomorrow  but all i know is gabby is absolutely worth fighting for  did you have a good break  yeah i took two showers  these european showers  are sometimes hard to figure out  they always stop at celsius  and i am like hotter  i think jason and i are more alike  than what we seem  which is why i am so drawn to him  there is something about him  that makes me feel really at ease  oh thank you  going into tonight i am just hoping  that we find some solid ground  to bond us together to help me decide  are we as compatible as i hope we are  i  like  i feel like you are pretty reserved  yeah yeah  yeah no i was yeah it is like really  like i am typically a pretty private guy  yeah and it is hard for me  to open up unless i am in like a comfortable situation  yeah and this is like completely  out of my comfort zone yeah yeah  like like to be honest like  i got here and was seriously overwhelmed  yeah i bet and i did not realize  how crazy that house would be and like  i did not eat for or sleep for like three days  oh totally yeah  and then i was like  i cannot do this  yeah and yeah it was like  i almost had like a breakdown or i did  oh you are telling me yeah  welcome and um yeah  and i think i am like a highly sensitive  like person in terms of energy because like  yeah um  i feel like growing up i was always like  like as a kid i would look at my friends and like  i do not know i just always felt like i was not  good enough in a way  it was just kind of hard yeah  and then i would try to prove myself  with like tennis and like try to win and stuff  yeah and then i started  to hate tennis and then i quit  yeah so that kind of like  i think is why it takes me like a little bit more  to open up to people of course  because like i think i you know  took ev took everything personally  and just like kept it inside of me because of that  years and years of that  totally  and now as like an adult  through therapy i have like figured out  to like speak up for what i want  yeah and like   hi  oh hi  how are you good how are you  sorry for the surprise but yeah  uh mind if i come in do you want to come in  thank you thank you  i wanted to have a quick talk if you had some time  yeah  how are you doing i am good  how are you  i am good  um  i have like never really gotten a chance  to tell you that like uh  um  like how honored i am  like whenever you put a rose on me  this feels really good to hear you say  yeah um  but i feel like something is kind of been holding me back  a little bit a feeling that i have kind of  been anchored down by a bit yeah  and like at the beginning of this journey  first group date going over to your house  you and i shared like a real connection  mm hmm  and i also got to talk with gabby  mm hmm  and me and gabby  also had a strong connection  yeah  and at the end of the night  i originally thought that i was going  to receive a rose from gabby okay  and it is been hard for me moving forward  to kind of forget about that connection  and when i read that date card today  i felt that everyone else on that card  was sure that you were going to be  someone who they could end up with at the end of this  mm hmm  well i still had reservations  and feelings for gabby  mm hmm  and that being said like  i cannot go today okay  and i am going to have to like step away from  from pursuing things with you  i look at myself in the mirror and i m like i m a fool  like look at you uh huh  i am surprised that you even gave me a chance  in the first place yeah  i mean you accepted so many roses from me  when the whole time you really did not  even want to spend time no  like i appreciate you bringing this to me  if that is where your heart is like  i appreciate you telling me  i just wish it would have been earlier  it is also not something that i have been sure of  until recently yeah  like  of course the first thing i think  when this first popped into my head  was like you are crazy  like look at rachel look at who she is  you do not have to explain that  you do not have to keep going i got it  you know i am not trying to be mean  i just i get it okay  obviously this is tough to hear  and no one really wants to hear this so  yeah mm hmm  um thank you yeah  i really thought going this far he would not have flipped  like looking forward like  i was really hopeful that things  could pick up with logan and i  because i think he is like a great guy  i am attracted to him  like i did give him  the first group date rose  and this whole time he was like  how do i tell rachel  i don t even want to be here  well good luck  i will walk you out  everyone is leaving me  it is just like the rejection that just feels really awful  and it almost feels like i am doing something wrong  i do not know  something is clearly wrong with me but i do not know  i mean no one can sit here and honestly tell me  i did not fail  it is just this was supposed to be like  my time to like find someone  and everyone is rejected me week after week after week  there has not been one week someone is stayed all week  i just do not even know why i am here  everyone is that is not is going to leave at some point  and i feel like now is the perfect time  so why do not they all just leave  then at least i do not have to say that i quit  i do not want to do this anymore  dude wow  we are in bruges baby  oh it is so beautiful here  i love this place already  the smell of belgian chocolates and waffles  the beautiful castles  the beautiful horses that we see  hi horses  i just knocked it out of the park  on a one on one in paris with rachel last week  now it is time to show that like  i can make her feel special  and on top of the world on a group date  yeah oh they are in chocolate  i am excited to see rachel  and kind of enjoy the day with her  you know see her laugh see her smile  oh  logan s not with us right now  and i do not know why  but one less guy does give me more of an opportunity  to talk with rachel and i cannot wait   to spend more time with her  i just do not know what to do  my guys just like keep getting  the short end of the stick constantly  like i feel bad that they have to keep dealing with this  week after week but i am not ready right now  to just go on a group date and act like  i do not feel like a huge loser  wow  and like the worst part about logan  is like the whole time he was just seeing  how far he could get until he could switch to gabby  logan how many weeks were you going to go  before you did this when you knew apparently  at that first group date  why did you accept my rose  this is two weeks before hometowns  this is happening  like i should have  at least seven guys who want to be here for me  and i do not  like i am literally just like  such a failure as a bachelorette  hey  can i come in and talk with you for a second  yeah i am so sorry  thanks jess  well  talk to me what is going on  i mean it seems like i thought  we would be past the point of people changing their mind  and we are not  and it just does not seem out of the realm of possibility  for it to continue to happen  and not even just like gabby but just for people  to change their mind about me  mm  and it is just scary because it is like  how could i not keep expecting it to happen at this point  yeah how is it affecting you  like how are you now towards the other men  i definitely feel like i have walls going up  and it is just unfair to the guys who are here  they have to keep picking me back up  because i keep having like these really bad days  but i feel like i am just like  getting dealt really bad cards like  pretty much in a row so it is like  hard to keep having momentum  i feel like i am like failing  in the role as the bachelorette  you cannot be the perfect bachelorette  yeah i wanted to be  the perfect bachelor  it is impossible  rachel it is impossible right  we get put into situations  that we never could have prepared for  we can do all you can do  is make the best decisions in real time  using your intuition  even though you are going through a storm right now  the hope is for you to fall in love with someone  who loves you back for you and they get down on one knee  and that is still totally in play  yeah  it is just like hard  like i really appreciate everything you are saying  i do it is just  it is tough right now to  i know  like i should not be feeling this sad  no there is no playbook for this thing  i know  i wish there was me too  i would love to give you mine but all of our journeys  are totally different right i know  i know  so as you know the guys are in town  yeah  there is supposed to be a date today  yeah  what do you want to do  i just want to do something like see her  because that is why we are here  i cannot wait to see rachel  i have not seen her all day  i figured i would see her by now but i do not know  how much longer we got to go here  what is up guys hey  how you doing what is up  jesse how is it going jesse  fellas good to see you all  good to see you welcome to bruges  i know you guys were excited to see rachel and not me  but i did have to come here to tell you that  unfortunately rachel has decided  to cancel today s date  some stuff went down and she does not feel like  she is in the right mind set to go on this group date  with you today in bruges  but it does not mean she does not want to see you all  so rachel is going to see you at tonight s after party  so head on back to the ship and get ready  rachel will see you there tonight  gentlemen again i am very sorry  see you in a bit  damn  i am feeling really disappointed  i want to enjoy these moments with rachel  and you know every single day  i do not get a chance to spend with her you know  those are memories that i miss out on with her  now we do not really even get to like share this with her  so let us just bring our a game tonight  cheer her up keep it as low drama as we can   i am really bummed  i just really wanted to be able to experience belgium  with rachel because we had such an extraordinary time  in paris  and for anybody else to bum her out  and it affect like an experience  i can have with her i feel stripped  of a wonderful opportunity with my future wife  it is very frustrating  just like we wanted to have a really great week with her  and this is not a great start  so who knows what is going to happen next  i just did the daunting task of telling rachel  that i have wanted to pursue gabby  i feel terrible  but i could not continue on with the charade  and now i have to tell gabby  the light at the end of the tunnel  would be the off chance  that gabby feels the same thing i feel  and i can stay  it seems unlikely and i am aware of that  and if i end up going home it will be for a good reason  because i actually went after what my heart wanted  hi  hi how are you  good how are you  good um  yeah come in yeah  i am sure you are surprised to see me  i am  yeah  do you think we can sit down  yeah of course  um how is it going  it is going good  i have actually been wanting  to talk to you for a while  oh yeah yeah  mm hmm um  when i met you at your mansion like i was like  on fire for you that first night  and i was hopeful that you would give me a rose  yeah  and i got one from rachel  and we have had some great moments  yeah  but i have come back to like thinking about you  and it is something that is gotten in the way  yeah um  so this morning i had a conversation with rachel  okay  and i told her  that like i needed to step away from dating her  how how did she take it  i think she understood but she was frustrated  yeah  which like i would never blame her for  and i know you guys are so close  yeah and  i am not here to like look for a response  i am not asking for an answer or anything like that  yeah but i did want to say it  yeah no i appreciate it and i feel like  i can just be straight up with you  yeah but it was kind of  you were pretty much our only overlap  you know like in the beginning  like you were the only one that both of us  felt like we could comfortably say you know i m into him  and then that night when you came over  and you had kissed both of us and it sounded like  you and her had a really great conversation  i like completely backed away  but that is when i was like dang  like i you know very interested  and it might not be as easy for me  to let go of my feelings  but we are on our separate journeys now  and i just want to check in with rachel  but yeah absolutely  i am just glad you got to like sit here  and like hear me out  yeah absolutely  thank you  this like is my worst nightmare you know  on the outside of things  like me being here yeah you  i am your worst nightmare yeah  good thank you  not really what i was looking for but  right but it is not you it is just i want to always  always always put my friends first  but and i am like and i have been interested in you  it just i was surprised to see you obviously  i just kept looking at you  i was not sure if you would remember my name  it was like such a risk for me  yeah  you would like tell me like  oh i have fresh towels i m good  right like not today  yeah  not interested  but yeah i am glad we got to talk  it feels a lot better already just being honest  yeah totally  all right  i can walk you out  okay  i feel good about that  after talking to her for seconds  i realized why i was doing this you know  bye  but my future at this point is completely unknown  now i am moving into this no man s land  i am not in rachel s group anymore  and i am not in gabby s group  i could be going home tomorrow   i think the conversation between gabby and rachel  will be a difficult one  hi  but i would like to think  they both want what is best for each other  and maybe i am part of that  what is going on  did you hear do you know yeah yeah  well he came to talk to me okay  i get he is following his heart but i am like  how many roses were you going to take  until you were like going to jump  like where was like the line yeah  like was he genuinely trying and then like  decided he could not or was it like  i just want to see how far i can get  yeah and that is like  where i was at and now of course  he had to do that before the date  yeah i know i hate that  that was the first thing i thought of too  and i cannot imagine having those feelings  like before a date  but how did you feel when you like went  i did not go  there was no date no  i like could not because i asked these guys  to give me every single time  i cannot go in there being like oh someone else left  and i feel like a failure yeah  it is like the bachelorette  because it is like logan just came in  and dumped me for another bachelorette  like this is humiliating  yeah humiliating  and so like i am going to try to go tonight  but like i just still do not feel great  like i would honestly feel the same way  yeah  but like what do you how are you feeling  because like i want you to get what you need out of this  if that is something you want to pursue  i do not ever want to put you in a place  by like having to see him or you know  i do not want you to be thinking about me so much  that you like if there you genuinely think  something could be there that you lose it  yeah you know what i mean  i think the only reason i would agree  is to like explore it more mm hmm  but like you do not deserve  feeling like these guys are not here for you  because i see the way they look at you  and i know how crazy they are about you  and like i want you to see that  yeah  i appreciate that the first thing you thought of  was to come to me and i love you  i love you mm  i think gabby is interested in logan  okay bye  but i just do not think logan is trustworthy  he strung me along for weeks  and i just really do not want that  to happen to gabby in the future  and for her to feel as hurt as i do right now  at the end of the day i am going to support her  no matter what but i really hope  gabby sends him home  i was really excited to spend some time with rachel  that was some place that i really wanted  to experience with her mm hmm  and i did not get a chance to do that  but you know going in tonight  you just got to make up for lost time  obviously without logan here  there is some unanswered questions right  so you know hopefully she can address those  if she is comfortable  you know good news is there is a rose on the table  so now that there is only five of us  i think we can all get some quality time with her  what we have to do is just be there to listen to her  and be there to support her  anyone nervous yeah  i just do not know what you know happened at all  i mean everyone just put two and two together  that something bad happened  because she is not feeling well  i do not know how it is going to turn out  i do not imagine it is going to go well  first of all i  i want to really apologize to you all  this morning logan did come to my room  he told me that he is interested in pursuing  a relationship with gabby  and this is something that gabby and i  it was kind of our biggest fear  but i thought we were farther enough in this process  where this was not going to happen  it is just tough like the constant rejection  and i do want to like open the floor  like if you guys like do not want to be here  like you do not have to be  if anyone you know has any concerns  or wants to leave just  obviously let me know  i would rather know now  i definitely feel very vulnerable and nervous  when you are rejected it makes you question yourself  it makes insecurity come up  mind if i grab you for a sec  yeah of course  i would be lying if i said i did not think  other people would walk out  i am just having a really hard time moving forward  and if this does not go well i do not know if i can  so hopefully tonight changes all that  because at this point i feel like  everyone is going to walk out  how are you like  it just was like   obviously me and gabby s like biggest fear  like in this whole thing is like  is someone going to flip  i am sorry you had to deal with that  it is okay  like the fact that like  you hold it together with such composure and grace  thank you i mean seriously  you do not have to apologize it is like  i do  i do really appreciate that  but i mean like i am here because  i love that feeling of seeing you smile  and making you happy  that is who i am i am want to make you smile  and i want to make you happy every day  i love that  thank you for checking up on me truly  of course of course  what a day  yeah it is a tough one  she handled that very well  absolutely that is tough  oh my gosh are you kidding me  especially with logan getting a rose last night  ah yeah you know  you know i want to have a conversation with her  you know to just tell her that i am here for her  and i am invested in this relationship  i agree yeah  the other guys they are in a different place than me  they all have expressed that they want  to make sure she is happy and feels like  a million bucks tonight  and that is all amazing it is  and i want to do the same  but i want to touch on how i feel  this is for us wow  i wanted to do something special for you  i actually was pretty hurt  you know i see rachel as my future person  and it did not sit the best with me  when you are in a relationship a healthy relationship  you both need to be able to communicate your feelings  i am like a little bit scared to have  this conversation with rachel but like  we definitely got to have it  moving forward i want to be your person  i mean that is why i am here  and i want to be your best friend  and i want you to be able to tell me literally everything  and i will just say like i will take any piece of you any day  and today we lost like something that like  i think we could have made like  i mean i know could have made like an amazing memory  but today you know hurt a little bit  yeah  like it made me feel a little unseen  like i do not want to make you feel bad at all like  no i want you  i want you to keep telling me how you feel  i feel like our relationship at this point  has gotten to the point where like we can  talk about stuff like this yeah  you have no idea  i do see you okay  i literally look forward to every single time  we get to spend together  i want to keep building on what we have  not you know kind of gloss over things  and i want to build it the right way  i love that believe me  thank you  tino continues to be truly open and vulnerable with me  and hearing him want to be around me  even if i am not in a good mood or if it is just for a second  it is a really good feeling especially  after all the rejection i have been through  it really just does make me hopeful  you know how are you i am good  this was like the last thing i needed  i know  i feel like you have been through a lot  and so far tonight everyone is checking up on me  and validating me  you know we missed you today  we were waiting for you to like  eat waffles and drink beer  i want a belgian beer so bad  and although it was definitely nerve racking  walking in tonight everyone is truly been able  to make me feel so special  how cool is that oh my god  just for you  oh my god  i feel like i am in the stars  you are the star  it is been so tough to get to this point today  but my feelings are just growing stronger and stronger  and it is a really great feeling  how are you doing today  do you feel like you can like breathe now  yeah no i feel better  i wanted to like really show up for everyone  i was pretty worried about you  if you were okay and feeling still  like okay about everything and all of us guys  the connections are you know getting deeper and it is uh  it is not easy and you are handling it  absolutely like a champion thank you  no i appreciate you being so honest with me  and truly i feel like every time i am with you  my day is so much better  you know sometimes if you want to let out stress  like you normally would yell right  do you need to get any do you want to get some yelling out  yeah  should we get some yelling out  i want to  and keep in mind like i got a deep yell  can i just scream  all right let us just scream okay  in three two one   it is incredible yelling out  my frustrations with zach  he really does make me laugh  i feel like i genuinely can be myself around him  i am really happy that the day was able to get turned around  because at this point in the journey  i want every single rose to go to someone who truly continues  to step it up with me  hi guys  and after such a great night  i am very confident that these guys are all here for me  um  so i know that today was not ideal  and i really do appreciate of you being able  to truly show up tonight especially  after sort of a low day for me  but this rose can only go to one person  and this person continues to be extremely vulnerable with me  and is able to open up with me even when it is really hard  and so  tino will you accept this rose  yes i would love to  i mean it is funny because like every rose i get  i feel like is like the most important rose i have gotten  but this one was a special one  because it is like resemblant  of like hard days in a relationship  it is exciting to like see a future with somebody again  have a good night guys  i mean i am happy for tino but like damn you know  rachel s the person you know that i could  be spending the rest of my life with  and it is becoming very very real  i mean i have been giving my heart out from day one  so there is like real real feelings on the line  and i do not want to be hurt  i feel relieved  i have said what i feel i have stated who i want  and that is gabby  and what happens now is out of my hands  gabby s going on a group date today  and i am just hoping that i will get an answer soon  and hopefully gabby will give me a shot  hey  hi  ooh that is a far road good to see you  you too  you guys are always out of breath  thank you hi  oh it is so good i know this is a great seeing hi  how are you guys  good it is so nice here  today we just get to explore the city  one of literally the cutest and charming european cities  that i have ever seen  so i am so excited to just spend the day with you  and have some quality time  shall we  yeah okay  i am following you i do not honestly  have a ton of doubts going into today  i feel like i have an open heart and an open mind  best case scenario today is that i connect more  with these men and just have a sense of normalcy  and enjoying kind of everyday things  have you guys seen these boats  should we go on one  gabby gave her one on one date to johnny  so i am disappointed a little bit  but looking forward to the date today  and getting time with gabby  this group date could very well be make or break  in terms of my time to continue to explore  something with gabby and keep building that connection  how fast can this thing go  yeah oh my god  this is beautiful that is beautiful  like the greenery i love it  i love the old brick  low bridge nate  protect your head  duck duck duck  gabby looks amazing today  she was in a all black outfit  i could not keep my eyes off her but going on a date  with five other guys it is  it is pretty weird  oh my god i smell waffles  waffles  hi  how are you  good how are you  welcome at house of waffles  thank you we are excited  would you like to try to make one yourselves  love yeah   it was pretty gutting hearing like  a stupid card not for you  i am going to go to the gym i have some pouting to do  yeah new week guys group date one on ones  i feel like the one on one s going to be big  for whoever gets it this week  obviously there is a lot on the line  hometown s coming up  this week is heavy i mean i am excited  you cannot not be excited to be in amsterdam and go on a date  but for me it is all about you know growing in a relationship  and just the more time you have like that is important  so today s one on one i need that  me and gabby have a great connection  that i believe in wholeheartedly  but i really need some one on one time  with deep conversations to make her believe  that i am someone who could meet  her family and she is someone who can meet mine  nate  let us see where our love takes us  heart gabby  oh my gosh i was not expecting  my name at all honestly  yeah uh whew  i was so happy that i got the one on one  that is the same face you made the first time  i am excited to spend time with gabby and  i really feel good about the connection that  me and gabby have and where this is headed  so i am hopeful that i will get a rose  hometowns are like next week  yeah it came so fast  i know it is crazy to even just say that to you  because it feels like we were just back in la  gabby rachel  hi hi jesse  hey you two how are you  how is it going so great to see you  i am sorry i do not want to get up  how are you do not worry  how are you it is great to see you  how are you oh i am doing great  i love amsterdam  this is one of my favorite cities in the world  really yeah  you have been how about you both  excited to see the city today  yeah i am excited for you both too  yeah how is this whole thing  going for you is this thing working  i mean i definitely think it is working for both of us  i think it is for sure for me yeah  we are getting to the point we are involving families  and i do want to be sure moving into next week  i think today i am bringing zach  and he was one of my first one on ones  i feel like zach s really stepped up for you  in a lot of different ways mm hmm yes  do you see something long term with zach  i definitely think i could yeah  really that is a great sign  i know  you think love s in the air for you  i know how you feeling  i think so i think a little too much  i know you have a one on one with nate today right  mm hmm you guys have  a really really special thing  yeah definitely  i think our connection is kind of palpable  when i am with him i do not really  think about anything else  and i think i just i have never really met anyone like him  i know he is an amazing dad  and he lights up when he talks about his daughter  but if if i wanted to jump into a commitment like that  i would want to like that i would want to be ready  yeah for sure yeah  big week obviously with hometowns next week  mm hmm how does that make you feel  nauseous yeah  what scares you about hometowns next week  or what gives you any concern about that  um once you involve family you know  your decisions become more tough  and you are involving more than just one person  so it is just hard to balance truly  mm hmm yeah  i am just watching you and you seem a bit emotional  are you doing okay  yeah i think it is just going to be a hard week  you know with making decisions and having  to think more logically  it is really tough these are tough decisions  yeah and emotional ones  yeah  so i can appreciate how you feel  thank you yeah  with hometowns being next week  i know i have to think about involving the families  big decisions coming up a lot on the line  nate does have a daughter so i have to think about  both of them when i am making decisions  i know these are big dates  so i wish you both the best right  thanks jesse and we will see you soon  thank you enjoy amsterdam  i take the potential of being a mom  so seriously because of my past  and you know at times childhood was hard  and parenting did not look like it does in other people  and i am terrified of maybe putting someone else  in my position or maybe making a wrong decision  and i have to weigh these options really heavily  today is my date with nate  nate is always the most comforting conversation  i mean him and i are just so easy together  i love the way he treats me and the way he looks at me   and the way he sees me and i love being with him  and knowing that he is a dad i feel like his daughter  is the luckiest girl in the whole world to have him  and that makes me love him even more  just a slow walk  you know i go back and forth  on if i want to be a mother and that is something  that i do not quite have figured out yet  it just seems so complicated and there are some  serious things that we need to talk about  hi hey what is up  oh  mm  how are you  i am doing really good  it is so beautiful here  i know  i know have you been  uh yeah but it was during the pandemic  so nothing was open oh really  it was crickets it was like a ghost town  i bet that was nice kind of though  yeah it was it was cool to a point  like to be quiet  but could not eat anything could not experience anything  it is always nothing but  like not cool parked cars and you know  frozen water  you are so full of surprises  i was like my name is definitely not on this card  i kind of just got it out of my mind for a little bit  i was like okay just going to be chillin  ready for the group date  and i heard it my heart dropped again  i was like you keep trying to kill me  oh my god this is so nice i was like thank god  you know nate has had tremendous success  in building his relationship so far  gabby choosing nate could be just her wanting  to kick it with him again you know  they do have a strong connection and it could just  be you know i want to spend more time with him  but it also can mean you know there is some important things  that she needs to circle back around touch on  you are totally right  there could be some things that she wants to address or that  she wants to learn more about before pulling the trigger  but i think all of us guys sitting around the table  are looking at the last rose nate got thinking  well he is in a pretty good spot i would i would assume  yeah he went from a one on one  to a group date rose yeah  you know to another one on one  i think that is huge yeah  have you been here before  no i am so excited no  ah me too it is so  i want to see the tulips  are they in like the actual city  i do not know there is like tulip fields  i think they are everywhere okay  but they are so beautiful and so big  oh boy  nate s taking care of a child  presumably that is something gabby has thought about  but that very well could be something that is discussed  and that is you know a point of conversation  during the one on one today you know whether or not  she is ready to step into a motherly role right away  is something that is probably sure  part of the conversation  dude nate loves his kid  he talks about her all the time  and i think everything he does is for her  so nate s not only looking for you know  a future partner a future wife  he is looking for a future mother to his child  and and that is a huge weight to put on gabby as well  so gabby s got to consider stepping into a mother role  right away like you said and and i think just  for both of them the decision s really tough  i really do not know how she would react  to the idea of stepping into that type of role  yeah i want to say he is coming back  but there is i think a huge possibility  that he also does not come back and  yeah  which is scary thing about too you know  yeah  you said have you been here before or no  no you have not oh nice  no but i am stoked  nate is an amazing person and an amazing father  i know he is  but i have more healing and growing to do  before i become a mom and my life is not in a place  where i can fully commit and take on  that responsibility wholeheartedly  you want to be together so bad but you cannot  and i do not know if i should have done it earlier but  we are going to sit here  okay  this is just when it gets so hard  nice  today has been  i know  i am sorry to like cry and to see you like this  but i wanted there is been so much going on   you are fine do not be scared  um  god i do not even know where to start  i wanted today for us  is to be like so special  but i have like such deep feelings for you  and i know  i think do not cry  no it is okay  please it is okay  it is going to get harder  and i never want to say goodbye  but i think  we are just at two different places in our life  mm hmm and  it is not you and it is me  it is not you no it is  it is not and i know it is so clich  but  i am like terrified of  of not just like being a mom  but being like bad at it  but i know i see you and i know you are such a good dad  and i know she is so lucky to have you  and really she has to be the luckiest girl in the world  and i know like  meeting her if if i were to  i would not have a choice but to fall in love  because i know how much she is like you  well  and i do not know what you are thinking or  but i know every time i see you  my feelings get deeper and deeper  and it is just so hard because it is you  for one when for when the time comes  i know you are going to be a great mom  thank you so much  you are such a big huge part of my journey  i know i am going to miss you so much  that is going to be the hardest part for me too  i am going to miss you a lot  i am just sorry that it is like  do not apologize i know  i do not know if i have ever met anybody as sweet as you  oh even now like i  the fact that you even think that you have to feel sorry  about being like this it is  oh  i would never be upset at you for being truthful so  no i know which makes it harder  this has been the best experience ever  i am so glad i met you  i really am  i just do not want you to regret it  because you have made my experience so special  you taught me what it is like to be treated so well  i am going to miss you a lot  yeah  i just know somebody is going to be lucky to feel like  you picked them and vice versa  just just  just make sure you choose somebody who picks you okay  and i know you will  give me a hug  let us go okay   oh god  i have never experienced what i have with nate  it was like so raw and real and special in its own way  i am just so grateful for him  i feel incredibly lucky to know him  i just want to be able to go into motherhood  you know knowing and  i cannot say that i do right now but  it just seems unfair that it is someone  that i was maybe falling in love with  good luck gabby okay  i do not know if i made a mistake  i cannot think clearly  even just the way  he handled everything makes me want to be with him more  it is just it is so sick  and it is hard losing someone like that  and it is hard knowing if you have made a good decision  god  this feels like a bit of heartbreak  a bit of confusion just i do not know  you know i have never communicated with someone  so easily  you know just felt a warmth of just being around her  being able to laugh and talk  it is just going to be a hard connection that  i do not think i will be able to replicate  oh man i just remember the first time  that i heard my name on the date card  i was just happy  and then just seeing it end in front of me just like  our entire relationship from the start  what was inevitably the finish was just hard  to accept that it was over  oh dude  nate s gone nate s gone  wait what  wow  that is crazy man he was a good guy  i knew like coming in  it was going to be a little hard for me  but tried to stay positive  and just keep pushing but it did not work out  you cannot just switch off emotions and feelings  i am still you know falling for her but  it is just sad it is over  it is hard losing someone like nate  just seems too early and too late all at the same time  and it is hard knowing if you have made a good decision  and so right now  it just hurts  today i have a really fun day planned with zach  this is a once in a lifetime bucket list date  i mean these tulips are only in bloom for two weeks  and i have never seen anything like this in my entire life  the netherlands are so beautiful  being in this field is  just absolutely crazy that i am here  hey  come here beautiful   hi how are you oh  wow  hello hi  i am so excited to be able to spend some time with zach  welcome to the netherlands  i really just know zach and i will pick up  right where we left off  are you excited oh i am so excited  look at how beautiful this is i know  we will go this way yeah lead me  is not this so pretty  we can pick the tulips here too  we can mm hmm  what is your favorite color so far  i really like the red ones  but look at how beautiful these are  zach always makes me feel great  and seen and really special  will you accept this tulip  i would love to  my pleasure  we have a playful great relationship  we have a lot of chemistry  ooh so handsome  zach is so in touch with his emotions  three two  beautiful  but he still can have fun  we can be goofy  cannot wait to look at these later  oh you think you are keeping them  oh yeah you think you are  no shot  i think zach just really has  the qualities you could want in a partner  little selfie right here  and i am just really excited to spend the day with him  i know today s going to be magical  magical  i think magical is the word  whoo  where i am with rachel i think is  you know the strongest it can be at this point  do you think i could stand up on the seat  you are actually trying it  no no no no  i feel like i am on the top of the world right now  i mean i could see my future with her without a doubt  do you want to stop here  uh yeah  so getting the second one on one date  means that i think she is maybe thinking the same thing  would you like to have some cheese maybe or  yes i would yeah  it is in dutch it is brandnetel kaas  it is nettle cheese  ever since rachel and i s first one on one date in la  every time we have been together  well these are wooden shoes clogs  ooh  yes  every time we have laughed and joked  and hung out together  oh my gosh they look so good on you  it is just gotten better and better and better  we are not in la anymore  no we are not  hello hello  as clich as it sounds the sky s the limit  thank you thank you so much  how do you say cheers in dutch  proost  proost  ooh proost  oh my gosh  this is so beautiful  let us buy a windmill huh  rachel is everything i have ever wanted  she still gives me butterflies  she is absolutely stunning she is so fun she is so kind  and from moment one with her  she is made me feel comfortable  oh my gosh what  after the culmination of dates we have had  and group dates and cocktail parties  and getting to know her more it is also crazy  to say i think i may be falling in love with her  this is actually like the best day  and i did not think the last one on one  you know could be topped but  like getting this second opportunity  like on another one on one  like obviously so excited mm hmm  but like just how our first date went  and how every time we spent together like  it was just an absolute blast  and i feel like it got better and better and more fun  and we laughed more and we just  mm hmm  like just joked about the silliest dumbest things  i know and that is what i love  and that is how i know you know  that you know there is something here yeah  yeah  you like looking forward to the craziness  of like what a hometown can look like  yeah i am  are you  how are you feeling about all that  i mean to be completely honest  mm hmm  you could meet them now  right now for all i could care yeah  like i am that you know confident  yeah and like sure  that you would absolutely love them  and they will absolutely love you  zach has truly just continued to impress me  i would be honored  to meet the people that raised him  because he is just such an upstanding guy  i will never forget this my entire life  i mean i am in a field of tulips  i am in holland  and i have an incredible guy with me  and i am so just excited for tonight  and this really feels like i am in a fairy tale  this is so incredible  how is this real   today was incredible  we rode bikes through the countryside  smelled the tulips  it was pretty romantic  oh oh my god  and now this is an actual pinch me moment  i am in amsterdam at a beautiful museum right now  with beautiful rachel  oh my  this is incredible  i feel a lot of things for rachel  but mainly i feel like  i am the luckiest guy right now  the rose tonight means hometowns  and if things continue to go well  rachel will end up meeting the family  and the fact that that is a possibility is mind blowing  hello this is amazing  i am feeling excited but also  scared nervous anxious of the above  for when i am going to tell rachel how i feel  today was  bucket list absolute bucket list  i mean you have been checking off the boxes  since the moment i met you  and i have not had any doubts about you meeting my family  because not many people have  because this is a very scary thing  yeah you know like really  no i finding one  i know yeah  there is no one that understands more  right like i get it  but have you ever brought someone home  to meet your family  yeah well i in my life  i have had about two serious relationships  mm hmm you know one  one in high school you know  the typical high school sweetheart  and then one that ended about a little over a year ago  right i remember that one and that was actually where  things kind of took a turn in my life actually  where i was not okay  so i i wanted to talk to you about this because  yeah to see what you mean by that  it is it is really important to kind of the man i am today  yeah  about a couple of years ago i was about pounds  more than i am now  severely overweight  i have realized that i was not happy  and i did not have anything that resembled  like love for myself  so when i was trying to seek that in others  i could not find it even if it would  maybe it was right in my face  could not do it so  i needed to make sure that i myself became whole  and figured out what was the problem how do i fix it  and then once i am whole  i want to share that love with someone  yeah when i am there for them  and not make those mistakes  what did you do like to work on yourself  like what were the steps you took  yeah like to get there  to where you are yeah  the main thing that really did like help me in all this  and i you know  a huge proponent of it therapy  i was about to say because i could not agree more  i am very like excited that you said that  yeah i feel like it really  helps you like get to the bottom of everything  yeah like especially after  coming off of like clayton s season  going to therapy was my favorite part of the week  i really feel like i got to  like make the outline for myself  and like how am i going to move forward  and what do i like and yeah  i just i truly love it so much  so i am so happy that you also are a man  is not it incredible it is amazing  like how it can just do wonders  yeah are you still going to  like continue it are you still going to  oh my gosh yeah  when you i think really sit down  and like think about what you want things come to you  yeah and i am really happy  you are in front of me yeah  and that you are sharing this with me  and your struggle because you are seriously so incredible  and you are so deserving of love  and i just want you to know that  oh wow that is very sweet of you to say  and i actually did want to you know  you know tell you something  yeah  you know i can say now as a man with confidence  you know i am falling in love with you  and it is  it is crazy to say but  i am falling in love with you and  oh my gosh  oh my gosh i feel like my heart  is just like beating so fast right now  my mine too   and it just makes me feel happy  to share that with gabby  when i think about gabby i get really excited  and there is just like a true spark between us  i just feel like when we are together  we just have an amazing time  we got to tip these guys  percussive big band music   you need some beads

his bleep  oh this guy you want some beads  you have to flash me  why not  i am so happy to be here  yeah  it is so weird because i was actually going to leave  and then  when  like in the very beginning  and then i was like i want to stay for you  oh thank you  soft music  i know jason is so sweet and so sensitive  so i imagine he learned that from his family  he is you know a little more

seven weeks  tell me tell me the exciting adventures  this has been the craziest most  really just because of the environment and isolation  it is just i cannot describe how crazy it is  jason s character shone through right away  he has stood out in such a special way  i know he feels so much  wow yeah  you know some people need to wear their logo  and their brand on the outside  jason wears it on the inside  sniffles  he is a good kid  good man  yeah i missed him  our family has always been a very emotional family  and gabby said such positive things about jason  should we go chat over there for a little bit  okay  but i am only hoping for my son s happiness  i think he is on a very good path  if he continues to grow like this  so it is been a great experience  laughs  i mean yeah it is been a crazy experience  both laughing  but yeah  gabby definitely makes it worth it  meeting my family is a huge deal and  yeah that is  that is a huge deal for you i know  yeah and she is yeah one of the funniest  but like most genuine people i have ever met  and i feel like we this whole time  have had this like energetic connection  that like sometimes you do not even need to say something  you just can feel it i felt it  i mean when i got halfway to seeing you all at the table  i got a little emotional just thinking  this could be my daughter in law you know  well we will see  i mean gabby seemed very mature  and i could feel her warmth her easiness  and she is beautiful and you are projecting  happiness and calmness and ease with it i can see  you have been nonstop smiling and i am so happy  that i could be a part of it  and no matter what i will always support you  if it is the real deal  i want to be the best man at your wedding  right chuckles  my dad s reassurance that he supports me  in whatever decision i make means everything to me  it is a special moment that i will never forget  not to let a good beignet go to waste  laughs  and tonight i cannot wait for gabby  to meet the rest of my family  may the best days of your past  be the worst days of your future  cheers cheers  hey   blues music  bicycle bells dinging   i am so excited you

you are beaming sounds like it  so actually gabby you want to go chat  yes  jason s family is so sweet  and i know how close he is to his mom and his sister  i know that he is reserved we have both recognized that  so you know i just wanted to know  is he always like this  is it the environment is it the scenario  just like painting a better picture  of who he is as a person  right well what dirt do you want on jason  both laughing  i am just kidding everything  i really do not actually have anything  he just behaved and like you just giggled  you know did everything right  and i was like bleep  both laughing  um but he really is just the greatest person ever  laughing aww  he really is yeah  do you think he is like ready for a long term relationship  and whatever that might look like  i think that i could see him  being ready for like something serious like that  and like taking the next step  i just think he had not met the right person yet  yeah so  we both know we are kind of different from each other  but do you think  like he could be with someone like me  oh both laughing  sorry maybe describe more what you mean  because i like think you are great  yeah both laughing  gabby is great  i could definitely see her like  being part of our family  it is like he is like glowing yeah  it is weird but it does not feel that far fetched to think  jason might be ready to propose  and that gabby could be like my future sister  i think jason and i connect in the way  that we both feel our emotions so deeply  so deep  and i hear you are the same way kind of  yes yeah  so i think that is what led us to each other  yeah but i know we are different  and that was the most scary thing  about coming here today is that i did not know  if you guys would think we were okay for each other  what were you worried about like  like i know he is a little more reserved and stuff  and i am not so i do not know if you guys  think that is something that he needs in somebody  to me i would see it as a good balance  yeah  you know the whole thing was such a  it is so outside of his comfort zone  he was like mom what if i found my wife  what if i really found my wife there  both laughing  i m like it really  i mean maybe  that would be really good yeah  when i saw you two together i am like okay  there is something i can i feel something  really good between you i do not know  it was really cute  i mean it is really really cute  both laughing  i know i keep saying that but i mean it  no you are so sweet  but i just want you guys to have fun and be happy  and i hope it grows and i hope it keeps growing  mm hmm and of course  i am hoping for the best  i am hoping it turns out  the way i would love for it to go  i really do thank you so much  it means so much being here  i got a really good feeling from gabby  she was so warm and friendly   and i love the way she was into jason  best case scenario would be  he is truly in love with gabby  and gabby is truly in love with jason  and they live happily ever after  tell me everything  tell me what is going on  i still cannot process what has happened  i really cannot but something about her  just like puts me at ease in a weird way  we like definitely connect on like a deeper level  like and like she just gets it  yeah it is hard to believe  you know it is weird  like how did how could this happen  yeah  but it seems like it is happening  i know i do not get it  both laughing  but like i am trying to stay true to myself  and like taking it one day at a time  and not like rushing  and i could never see myself getting engaged  it is just not realistic to me  as much as you like you know have feelings for somebody  or whatever like that is just not something  i can see myself doing at this point  like maybe it will change in you know the next two weeks  but i need space to process everything that is happened  and like right  right now that is how i feel  and it is scary  yeah  so it is not  it is not her it is not her it is  it just would not feel right to me you know  so you have or have not had this conversation you said  no not yet but i will  okay  so how would you feel without her  i would be really upset like i would be sad  okay  so that is important to keep that feeling in mind  what would it be like without her  it makes me cry sobbing  sorry  dramatic music  i just do not want you to lose something  like you are so like distracted  by everything around you that you lose something that  you lose something because of the distraction  yeah  i get overwhelmed thinking about jason  because i just want to know that he is really happy  i just want to know that he found what he is looking for  and he feels really good about it  i love you  i love you too  but i hope that they go down that path  and come out together  yeah so we got to get out of here  aww but  i loved having you both  yeah  thank you i am so glad to meet you  thank you for having me i love you so much  and i look forward to seeing you again  i am really happy  after today i do feel like i learned so much about jason  seeing him with his family made my heart grow so much  and to know that they do accept me  just like means the whole world  love you  my feelings for jason get deeper and deeper every time  and i am head over heels for him   i can see myself with him forever  and excited for the future  i will miss you  i will miss you too  we had an amazing time together  i am falling in love with him  bye bye  i have never felt this way before  and it feels like i am in a dream  soft music   hello  hi  oh my gosh you are here  it is so good to see you  i feel amazing  rachel s going to meet the family tonight  oh my gosh so good to see you  rachel meeting my family is going to be  a huge and instrumental part  for her to understand who i am  gasps stop it laughs  on bikes again  we are not in amsterdam anymore  the last time i saw rachel i told her  i was falling in love with her  and this date is incredibly pivotal  i love this  i could be getting on a knee in a few weeks from now  and i want my parents to be  just as ecstatic and happy as i am  where are we going you will see  rachel s been taking me on all these incredible dates  and now it is my turn  i am taking rachel on the most incredible  hometown one on one date that she is ever going to have  okay so we are going to stop here okay  and we are going to do a little bit of trespassing  okay  we are climbing up this ladder right here  gasps stop   dramatic music   laughing oh my god  jet engines roaring  sweeping music  oh my gosh laughing  this is so surreal  oh my god  zach and i have talked about this memory  that we both shared with our dads  watching airplanes fly  i am so happy  you like it yes  that is the plane i fly  it is a moment we both grew up with  and something we hold really dear  so to share that together before i meet his family  it is really special  i am nervous but i am excited i am so excited  like with tonight you know meeting the family  they are going to have a lot of questions  for sure i mean you know they know  that you know what is later down the road after this  mm hmm  i am going to tell them that i am very much so  still and am you know falling in love with you  because this means a lot and you mean a lot to me  yeah so i am nervous  do not be nervous  but i am so excited  i am so excited too  it is incredible to hear how zach feels  we have such a deep connection  tonight is a huge night  family is just so important to both of us  and of course i am so nervous  but i am just really hoping my relationship with zach  can take off to new heights  jet engine roaring  home sweet home  oh my god  this is a potential family she is marrying into  is she going to fit in  we can be overwhelming  once she sees you she is going to be terrified  laughter but they will warm up you know  yeah  oh hi  both oh  laughter  hi everyone  i am so excited  rachel is going to be meeting my mom my dad  my sister my aunt nanette and uncle pat  i mean he is just as funny as he is  in his shows and movies  this is very important to me and i want their full support  and trust moving forward  so how has it been  i mean wow like in the first three minutes  or two minutes maybe there was immediately just  wow really  like crazy connection  and we had a one on one date yeah  a big surprise movie premiere  but the movie premiere was our childhood videos  mm hmm a message from both  you were in it yes aww  we were both just crying emotional wreck  it was like it was a lot  and i cannot wait for you to get to know her  obviously see something in her  and she is pretty incredible  you look very very happy together  yeah  i just feel sorry for those other fellas  that is all i can say  laughter  i see him walking in hand in hand  as if they had been together for quite some time  rachel how about you and i go have a little talk  absolutely  but i am concerned that he will be brokenhearted  if it does not continue  and i want to hear what her expectation is of my son  and i also want to hear what my son s expectation is  oh i am so excited to talk to you  and i do not know anything about you  but i know my son just is enamored with you  yeah  but he is also got an emotional side  yeah  and so i am concerned about him  because all the awesome experiences  i mean you go to the most romantic places on earth  and you will fall in love with a monkey  yeah  what attracts you to him  i think immediately kind of like he said  we did just have a connection right off the bat  being able to watch that video we immediately started off  our relationship talking about all of you  and talking about family and he got emotional  and i feel like that really was what solidified  just how great he is for me on top of everything  i already was learning that day  he is looking for the soul mate  absolutely  let us get this life going  yeah he was talking a lot about you and your wife  how you guys are still very much in love so  oh yeah  i know that he looks up to you guys a lot  i married my best friend  she happened to marry her best friend  and that is what he is looking for and me too so  you know you have had an incredible marriage  for all these years  yours dad s the family s approval  that does matter  and i do want you to always be like upfront and honest  i just knew when i looked at your face  i would know how you were doing  i just wanted to know that you were okay  i would see it whether you really were falling in love  or not because i know you   but we do not know her  i have actually told her i am falling in love with her  you have i have  oh my gosh  i can actually see a future with her and  i am so happy for you  oh boy so  i see it i mean i see it in your face  i see i see the love  are you ready  i think i am ready yeah  you are going to make me cry i knew i was going to cry  sorry you are going to make me cry  it just i think my biggest concern  is that there are other  other guys in the mix so  i could see it in his eyes  i saw nothing but true love and happiness  and i have never seen him like that  i love you babe i love you too mom  i missed you i missed you  my biggest concern is how fast  and how hard he is falling  knowing that he is falling in love with you  is that someone that you could see spending forever with  yeah i truly would this is so incredible  i know it is a tough question because i know  you have other dates but you know as a mom  believe me i am honestly  love him and i am just worried  yes i am so glad you are asking this  because there are still  obviously other relationships but there are  you know things that he has that truly no one else has  and our relationship is different  i do not want his heart broken you know  and no one ever wants that to happen to your child  absolutely yeah  he is genuine and when he is sharing with you  and sharing his heart it is for real  what i love or when i am with that person  that i want to spend the rest of my life with  i am going all in  that does leave you susceptible to heartbreak  if the other person s not you know the same way  i am aware you are in a very strange position  and your heart might be broken  but it might be filled with awesome rachel love  forever and ever  you do not know how good that makes me feel  you know hearing that  i am very proud of you son  she is incredible yeah  he just he is just a great person so  and i want him to find that from a person in love  and the way i see him talk about you  i really believe he is falling in love with you  and for him to feel that confident  in what both of you have  we are going to be right there with him  and embrace you as part of the family as well  that is so good to hear thank you  and we are kind of what you see is what you get  you know not i love it  i think i have the stamp of approval  from zach s family tonight  and his family is so incredible  and i could see myself fitting in  the opportunity to see him in a new light  and through other people s eyes is really beautiful  uplifting music  hey laughs aww  zach will you accept this rose  i am already crying laughs  oh my god  tonight i got to see my kid  but more importantly i think i probably met his future wife  i am falling in love with you  i cannot imagine going another direction than with my son  they just fit  it was perfect  oh my god laughs  you know you are not married yet right  laughter  tonight could not have gone any better  everyone loved her and she loved them  that was awesome that was good  clapping  best case happened tonight  i have received the blessing from my family  and rachel s the one  it was unanimous  they loved you and that meant a lot to me  just hearing all the positive things they said about you  i mean that was just what i needed to hear  and i can tell you that i am  i am in love with you rachel so  oh my gosh  soft romantic music   i feel so incredibly happy  this is crazy this is crazy  zach continues to say every single thing  i have ever wanted to hear  i cannot believe that he feels that way  it just means everything to me  i feel like this journey is working for me  see you soon i will see you soon  bye  zach makes me so happy  my feelings have definitely grown for him  i am falling in love with zach  he is so perfect  upbeat music   laughs  why are you laughing  we are here in palm beach florida  and i am about to meet my man johnny  welcome to florida  this is the most i have worked out  wow since i have been here  both laughing ahh  johnny s super hot  he knows it i know it you know it  he makes me feel so so special  it is so good to see you what is up  how are you i missed you   okay at the same time yeah  my parents literally have not like been together  since i like graduated college  like in the same room together so it is been  like six or seven six years  oh wow  i did not even think about that aspect of it  like yeah that is huge  rachel is someone that is very special  to me now at this point so it is very important  getting my parents approval  they are the two most important people in my life  but i could sense a little bit of nerves coming from rachel  so i got some stuff planned today  that hopefully will calm her nerves a little bit  after you  oh  this is so cool  oh my gosh should we get crystals  oh this one s for passion  okay we definitely need one of these  hi hi  hello welcome to crow haven corner  how are you hello  how you guys doing today

pleasure  just come with me okay i am excited  i have never done anything like this  but i am the most nervous to meet aven s family  so when it comes to love with aven  i will try anything  right now i can tell you that you are extremely nervous  i want you to remember that your words have power  and today you must take your power  and speak your words  know that it is okay to say what you feel  because if you do not there is only so much time  and lots of passion too  he is romantic just a little shy  she did tell aven he needs to open up more  and aven is the one who has told me  the least about how he feels  so right away rachel you are a giver  but what i can pick up about you is you need clarity  and so you definitely need that to start today  and i want you to follow your heart and your soul  and most of all your instincts  in honor of both of you today  i ask for love and light  and the correct love for both of you  and to have a wonderful beautiful magical night  wow whoa  so i want you guys both to follow your hearts  i enjoyed doing this with you today  thank you  and i wish the both of youse the best of luck  aww thank you so much thank you so much  this is incredible merry meet merry part  may we all meet again  yes  i am going to leave now and thank you  oh no not the fire  oh my god it stays burning  i knew that thing was going to fall  the table did not break though is it bad that that happened  can someone help me with the table  oh gosh  is that bad luck if it fell  our love spell just tumbled to the floor  i do not know what that means  i just hope it is not a bad sign  let us pray for tonight  oh my god whoa  welcome back to the men tell all  now the guys are all anxiously awaiting backstage  and if you think you saw fireworks this season  just wait until later tonight  does logan regret switching from team rachel to team gabby  going to ask him about that and then what about nate  has he recovered from that devastating breakup  with gabby in amsterdam  and will he also address the rumors about him  that have been running rampant on social media recently  and then of course there is hayden  will the man who enraged of bachelor nation  with his inappropriate behavior even show up tonight  just wait and see  but first rachel is about to meet aven s parents  so will she be welcomed with open arms  or is she going to need to cast a spell  let us find out  so we are going in  okay remind me again  yes we are going to meet my mom dawn  okay and my dad arthur  you ready i am ready  i am excited  aven s parents are going to be there together tonight  and in his previous relationships  they have never met someone at the same time  and neither of his parents have approved  of partners in the past  so walking in tonight i truly am shaking  like my teeth were chattering  this is a huge deal to me  because his parents could be my future in laws  this is a big deal  there they are oh my gosh  hi hi guys  meeting some of the other families  did not go as i planned so tonight with aven  i really just want them to like me  from the bottom of my heart it is so good to see  both of you here like at the same time   like fully supporting me in all of this  and i am so honored to introduce  this special girl to you both so  oh sweet cheers  thank you awesome cheers  well aven we were so excited to see you  yeah it is really good to see both of you  we were really excited to see  who you brought through the doorway  and we are so happy to meet you  and hopefully get to know you a little better tonight  and wish both of you the best  on whatever this journey is for you  we have had quite the journey yeah  the first night like i got the chance to talk to her  and like within  i do not even know like ten seconds  i was like yeah she s really  ten seconds ten seconds  she is like so cool and i just like immediately  was like oh this is perfect  i like knew  how did you feel at the beginning  i mean straight out the limo it was like  okay we are off to a great start  i definitely could not wait to talk to him  but as soon as we talked to each other  i feel like we definitely had a connection  right now the dinners and the hotels  and the travels around the world  that is all great well and fine and it is fun  but in real life that kind of stuff  does not happen all the time  rachel you want to come and have a chat with me  at the bar for a moment yes  so we need to be honed in on this is great  but how does this fit into my life  how does this fit into the real world  those are questions they need to be asking  themselves and each other  i know you have been through this process before  so i have some questions for you  what attracts you to aven as a person  there is something about aven i truly cannot describe  but he is just so incredible honestly  okay  i just feel like we have so much in common  just on a level of what we want  and how we want to raise a family  and how we want to live our lives  based on those things  do you see this being something  you can bring into the real world  absolutely  i have absolutely thought about my future with aven  and we have talked about things we want in the future  and what a family would look like  and what our life would look like  with my job with his job and  yes  it is something that we have talked about  because as much as it is a fantasy  it is all about getting to that point  of engagement and reality and for me it is serious  because when i get engaged that is it for me  and he said that for himself as well  he s like i would never get down on one knee  if i wasn t serious  it is nice to hear that you are looking for the same things  absolutely  so are you earnestly sincerely  whole heartedly ready to commit to love  with aven  my feelings for aven are so strong  i truly do see a future with him  okay  but can i sit here right now and be like  no i cannot to be honest  fair enough  but our relationship is just so special  i am excited to see where it goes  okay  i do think the conversation with aven s dad  is going really well but i am the most nervous  to meet aven s mom dawn  they definitely do have a really strong relationship  so i do still fully expect hard questions  you have got three others  yeah it definitely is  do you feel different with aven  are you on the same level with all of them right now  there are still other people here absolutely  and that is just a part of this process  and something i have never experienced  but with aven i feel so strongly for him  and he is so special  and i would never bring him into this position  and have family involved if i did not truly see  a future with him outside of this  i feel that about you  to see him come in and display that much affection  when he walked in with you was  that was right here that hit me right here  so the fact that he has brought you here  says a very powerful message to both me and his father  about who you are to him  how did your conversation go with rachel  it went well it went very well okay  i asked her some tough questions and  oh you asked  i have to say she stood up to them pretty good  that means something to me okay  do you aven jones think that you are ready  to take this to the next level  which means engagement and potentially marriage  are you ready for that with rachel  loaded question but yeah i am getting to that point  i am  if i get the validation from rachel  to getting to the end of this and being  like her showing me that she feels the same way as i do  and that she sees a future with me  i feel like that is enough validation   to trust that connection  okay and yeah  i like her i hope it works out  she is great she is welcome to the family  do not stop fighting for her man  because she is a good catch  tonight could not have gone any better  both my parents approved of her as a person  and someone who is right for me  yeah i got that today for sure  you seem a little more relaxed  no i feel so much better  i was actually shaking coming in here  i know  rachel she is somebody that i want to spend  the rest of my life with  and i think this is a perfect time  to let her know how i am feeling  oh my gosh this is such a good night  i know like i am so glad  that you liked them  so you do not have any like doubts  or like you feel good about everything that they said  i have zero doubts  seeing the look on my parents face  they see how happy i am with you  and it is just  this night just meant the world to me i swear  like my feelings are getting really really strong  and i like i am like falling in love with you  i am i really am  oh my gosh hearing you say that  is the most incredible feeling  you have no idea  what hearing you say this means  because i feel like you are obviously slow to open up  i am  and i have always just been like  i want him to tell me how he feels  and i am so happy right now  from the bottom of my heart i mean it  i feel so lucky right now  aven is falling in love with me  and it makes me so happy  because i have wanted him to say that  for a really long time  and it means everything to me  bye goodbye  be safe  i do feel like i am falling in love with aven  i feel really confident this could be it  this could be my happy ending  wow  it looks like rachel and aven are totally falling in love  but with such strong feelings for all of the remaining guys  did aven get a rose at the rose ceremony  well i got a spoiler for you  he did  in fact all of rachel s guys did  yeah  so did all of gabby s  now look i know you have not seen the rose ceremony yet  but guess what you are not going to see it tonight  we just have way too many things to get to  but i told you from the beginning  gabby and rachel they wanted to call all the shots  they decided that after their hometowns  they were not sending anybody home  they wanted to keep of their men  you want to see how it all went down  you can check it out on abc com  okay when we come back it is finally time  to hear from the men  what was it like dating two bachelorettes at once  how do the guys really feel about hayden telling gabby  she is rough around the edges  whoo look out hayden  rambo s not here to protect you brother  that and more when the men tell all returns  hi and welcome back to the men tell all  now look you have all been so patient  and i promise you it is been totally worth it  because the moment you have been waiting for  is finally here  it is finally time for the men to tell all  everybody ready for this  well please welcome roby  whoa  jordan h  termayne  jacob  jordan v  alec  quincey  ethan  spencer  mario  meatball  logan  tyler  and nate  right well gentlemen  it is so good seeing you all here  i think the last time i saw most of you  we were on a cruise ship we were sailing along  the northern coast of europe  dude i will tell you what  i never saw this goatee though spencer  i am digging the new goat  oh you liking it yeah  that means a lot coming from you  yeah yeah yeah thank you  it is a good look  did any of you know that that was roby  no  he surprised us all actually  i did not notice you with the platinum hair  i was in the bathroom getting ready  i am like who the is this  well listen there is so much to get to  let us go back to the beginning  let us start and nate i will start with you  it is got to be tough being in the limo  you are headed to the mansion thinking that  you have to leave this impression  it would be tough enough on one bachelorette  where was your mindset knowing  that you were about to meet two  my mindset was kind of like just don t pass out  i was literally walking up to them  but i was just met with such a warm embrace  that it kind of just felt natural  and i was able to be myself  you know i had nothing but respect for both of them  i think they did an amazing job   and there is nothing that they should look back on  and think that they have to change because i just think  they did it perfectly  yeah  logan what was the best part of dating two bachelorettes  um the lessons learned  i had to say something  thanks for asking jess yeah you got it  do not worry that will not be the last question  i ask about that either  right well i think we can all agree  that this was definitely a crazy experience right  with two bachelorettes we really did have  double everything  we had double the romance double the man tears  and of course double the drama  whoa  there is two bachelorettes  this is like history in the making  surprise  this is amazing  i have two opportunities with two stunning women  how is this going to work  you better choose wisely  i just felt like  a really good connection with rachel  and i really do want to pursue that  i do have my intentions for rachel  yeah  and i think you have a little bit more like  i want to say rough around the edges  like even if like say you were the only person here  i do not think i could have the heart to continue  but obviously like you are smoking  yeah  i think these guys saying that because i am different  they do not want to be with me is like validating  that i may be too much for people  will you accept this rose  i am sorry i cannot  i am here for gabby  i am going to have to decline your rose  did somebody else say no  i got to follow my heart and i am sorry  rachel being rejected by some of the men  at the rose ceremony that was very uncomfortable  i did not ever expect to be bachelorette  and then to be rejected again multiple times  after you already feel like you do not deserve it  it is hard  logan  she gave me a rose and i feel like the bad guy  logan will you accept this rose  but if it means i get to talk with gabby  i would be a fool not to accept a rose  the heart wants what it wants  i have come back to thinking about you  yeah  after talking to her for seconds  i realized why i was doing all this  fortune favors the bold  oh  how is everybody  i was shocked when logan came in  no guy s going to want to hear  that another man is being added to the mix  i just did not see that coming you know from logan  i thought he was like crazy about rachel  logan he is indecisive  it just shows a reflection of his character  but you know drama s always creeping somewhere right  like for me it would be a deal breaker if we got down  to the final four which i plan to be in  and we go in the fantasy suite  and we have this sexual experience  and then she decides that she is going to have sex  with multiple people and feel it out  that would be the situation where i would go okay i m out  what chris said i was pissed  first off you should not be talking  about fantasy suites anyway  clearly you are not here for the right reasons  they do not deserve what you just said  like if you are going to put them through that go home  do you feel like it is appropriate to be talking  about fantasy suites this early  i am not taking away anybody s else decision  and that is something that i would never want to do  to a female is take away their decision  i understand that you are thinking way far in advance  we can help make this decision at this point  i do not want anyone to be thinking about fantasy suites  it is so early  we do not even know if we have a connection  i do think it would be time for you to go  chris is playing the villain in the house  and who is going to be the next chris  like who is going to be the next one  that actually shows their true colors  gabby s the one that used the word  rough around the edges  and my dumb ass uses the same verbiage  that gabby uses to describe herself  and she did not like that  well bitch maybe you should not use that word  to describe yourself then  oh my god  i have been comparing my ex to like  like this right  they do not hold a candle to her  hearing this from hayden is disturbing  and that does not sit well with me  after what was said about gabby in la  you went and said i can t trust these bitches  that is not what i said i just do not believe you  can i walk you out yes  hayden it shocked me because what he said  it was absolutely insane  it is mind blowing  all right we obviously have a lot to unpack here  so i want to start with a challenge  that i think a lot of men here were faced with  at some point during this journey  and that was trying to figure out  which of these two women to pursue  ethan it is obvious we know that both rachel and gabby   they are both incredible ladies  how hard was it for you to try to figure out  which of the two you were going to pursue  you know i think in the first like two weeks  it was tough to navigate  but you know after getting comfortable  and settling in with each of them  i think i kind of knew right away  the direction that i wanted to head  so once we set sail to europe i mean  it was game on with rachel so  i came there for gabby since day one  so to have people not know what they want  even if it is two bachelorettes or not  you should know which one you pair up with  you should know which one you like more  love has to be true  termayne when you found out about the conversation  jacob had at the group date in la  it was very blunt with gabby  when he was explaining his intentions  to pursue rachel it did not go over great  what was your reaction  i mean honestly i feel like you were trying to you know  steer a line in the grass right then and there  i just feel like the words were just completely wrong  like rough around the edges was much better  than like if you were the only one here  then i would probably leave  jacob i do not feel like you were wishy washy at all  i just felt that you were kind of a  the way you addressed it  there you go and that is like the thing  you were to the point but like come on man  some manners over there  i yeah look there is no excuses for my actions  i was rude i was selfish i was ignorant of her feelings  i need to take ownership on that that i did mess up  i just have to learn and hopefully teach others  to do better as well  all right well the group date in los angeles  that obviously was not the only dramatic thing  that happened throughout the course of the season  i want to go back to that infamous rose ceremony  where three men meatball termayne and alec  all rejected rachel s rose  this was the rose ceremony that gabby and rachel made  a decision with respect to which guys  they wanted to continue dating  and you all understood and knew that you had  the choice to either accept or reject their rose  when rachel gave me the rose and she asked me like  so will you accept the rose and i was like no  because i have a better connection with gabby  and like when she asked everybody else like nobody  well meatball did say no but meatball also did  go back and like try to rekindle  his way back into the situation  which worked for him  but to me that is not genuine at all  that is like i want to just be here for the moment  you know what i mean  i mean there was a lot of questions  going through my head you know to it  i mean i came on open to both of them  going into that rose ceremony  i thought if i were to get a rose  it was going to be from gabby  that sounds like you did not accept the rose  because you thought gabby was more into you  as opposed to you being more into gabby  so like who the hell were you into  because like if you are more into rachel  then like say that  be that do that man up  like have some balls meatball  i just did not know at the moment  damn i mean  roby roby  hey roby you had your chance man  let me speak let me speak no but you talked to both  shut the up for a second and let me speak  yo bro how are you going to tell me  to shut the up let me speak  you are not hearing you know what i am saying  the decision that they made roby do this  do this  yeah disappear  roby you were there at the mansion  for four hours for a reason  yeah i mean have some respect  for the rest of us who had genuine feelings  who caught feelings for these girls  over the course of two months man  the decisions that they made i am saying  just shows that they made the right decision  exactly oh really  it is all about decisions man  all right i want to switch now  to someone who is not here with us tonight  and the reason why is because i think gabby and rachel  booted him so hard out of the mansion  that he did not dare show up to this men tell all  and of course i am talking about chris  chris was incredibly out of pocket the whole time  like out of touch with reality  just trash  like he did not help run the house  he was not trying to make friends with us  he was trying to control the women  he was condescending calling them females  like i hate it every time  it is like he looks at things so in his own way  like there is a right way to do everything  but it is got to be his way  and he thinks his do not stink but it does  like his breath  right damn  i do not know if any of you all got close to him  but it was bad damn  i think for me the biggest part is  you are saying this thing about fantasy suites which is weird  it is literally day two  it came off misogynistic just derogatory  that is not something you talk about  but number two to know what happened to these girls  a few months ago and then to say it right there  that is one of my biggest regrets from the show  is not saying something to him right then  i was hoping he would get taken down  that was absurd  to hear someone reduce somebody to their counterparts  of what they can only do for you sexually  is so barbaric  and i am glad that you guys brought it up  real men hold other men accountable  i was saying nate  all right listen we do have to take a short break  coming up later tonight gabby and rachel are here  to face their men  cannot wait for that  and after the break  what do the guys have to say about hayden  the man who said those nasty things  about gabby and rachel that no man ever should say  but is he going to show  well there is one man who did show up tonight   with myself because i do not have a decision right now  mm hmm  and with zach every single piece is there  zach has never left me in the dark with how he felt  he was the first one to tell me he was falling for me  he is so incredible  he is funny and he is a gentleman  and he is vulnerable and emotional  and just able to connect in a different way  but i do not think i am there with zach  and this is getting days away from an engagement  i want to use the time  to really be honest with myself and with him  yeah to see if i can get there  because like you said we have to be honest with them  but everything is so perfect on paper  yeah  wait okay so who are you bringing first  aven  wow  look at this  i think immediately with aven  we really had this great foundation  and we just continued to build on it  yeah  we have that romantic connection  and that physical connection  and he is able to be so honest with me  and every single he says i believe  i am a little nervous because i have not  told aven how i feel yet  yeah like what are you feeling now  i feel like i am falling in love with aven for sure  and he told me he was falling in love with me  during his hometown but i did not say it back  i was just kind of at the point  where i was still really scared because of what happened  on the season with clayton  yeah  i do not want aven to feel like that as well  so i want to get that fear behind me  and i really want to tell him how i feel  but i am so nervous about it aww  so what do you honestly need with your time with jason  and like how do you feel right now  we just have like a special connection  that i feel like i have never really  felt with anyone before  he is always been the most kind of emotionally available  to me  do you feel like you are falling in love with him  i think i am definitely falling in love with him  but i do not actually know how he feels about me  i feel like i have to just let him know  exactly what i need and then  i think you deserve it  you deserve to know how he feels  yeah  how do you feel about johnny  johnny and i do have so much fun together  and i have watched him grow so much  i think unfortunately we could be  in two different places in our lives  where i am very ready for an engagement and marriage  and he is not  but i can see the growth in him as a person  so he could really surprise me  right  so wait how are you feeling going into tonight  i know you have already told erich  that you are falling in love with him  i love how playful we are together  we have good banter  our relationship has grown so much  over last hometown week  and i told him i was falling in love with him  because it is true  and i did not realize that i needed  to hear that until he told me  but you know we are going into this week  having feelings in a certain way  but they can definitely change  and we are really going to have to use  every single second of the time we have left  to really make a decision that is best for us  yeah i think this week is going to be  unreal transformative  we get to rewrite what this week means  yeah  and make it into something positive  and ending with an engagement for both of us  i am so excited  and chase each other around naked  this is the most important week of my whole journey  let us get on with our big days  i know let us go and ever bigger nights  bigger nights  and i am so excited to see my guys this week  because it is just absolutely gorgeous here  beaches the jungle  literally the perfect place to fall in love  i am so excited  i love it here  i love the warm weather  rachel and i are going  on our first overnights this week  it is so exciting because i can see myself  potentially being engaged with one of my men  so there is a lot riding on these dates  and this is the perfect place for me to end my journey  not just because it is beautiful and tropical  but also because i am ready  i know what i want  i am ready to fall in love this week  and to hear the words i love you gabby  i cannot wait  i feel excited hopeful ready for the future  let us get it started  today s my first overnight date  and i am excited to spend the day with erich  we have grown so close after last week  erich and i had such a good hometown  which was really a huge stepping stone for us   because i saw his emotional side  his dad has been battling cancer  i truly cannot imagine how hard it is on erich  but seeing his family and how much they mean to him  just show what a good person he is  and that night we shared that we were falling  in love with each other  and i am still just reveling in that bliss  bienvenidos  how are you i am good how are you  it is good to see you  it is good to see you too  this  i have never met anyone like erich in the way  that we feel together and around each other  okay let us go  like this is actually our first date without family  but this week could be the most important week  even in the weeks to come because there is  an overnight date tonight  it is the only time we get uninterrupted time  alone truly alone  so today i want him to treat me like a girlfriend  like a potential fianc e  because i think erich and i do have physical chemistry  and i am really looking forward to seeing  where it goes tonight  yo  is this water yeah  yeah do you know what that means  salto de los enamorados  take off your clothes  oh gladly  i mean it does not but you can  okay but this is the lovers leap  hell yeah yeah  let us do it like right now yeah  no wait hold on  have you jumped off of things before  i have  you are going to have a lot of fun  this is a cenote  it is like a natural hole in the ground in a jungle  so should we jump yes  i am feeling absolutely amazing  gabby and i have had such a crazy connection  this whole time  and last time i saw her  i told her i was falling in love with her  so we basically crossed the threshold  where our relationship kind of just took  this like crazy leap  you ready ready  go no  oh my god that is actually higher than i thought  but dating gabby it has not been like  really easy to be honest because there are  still two other people here  so there is a possibility  i might not be the one for her  whoo  no  that is the risk for me  that is the thing that i think about  you know in the back of my mind  but at this point i am willing to throw myself at her  kind of have to take a leap of faith  because she is so freaking worth it  it feels good being in the water though  yeah it is really nice  now i want to do the high one  i do not know if i can do it  okay you go look  a little tall not going to lie  yeah  you want to just do it no  i think what it is is just one step out  oh god  oh i am afraid  you got this  so just one step  literally one step  standing here thinking about making this jump  it is a lot like falling in love  it is a huge leap of faith and it is very intimidating  yep you got it down  you got this  you got this  oh i am so scared  i do not want to make a big deal out of it  i know we are trying to have fun  and my heart is telling me to leap but it is so scary  maybe you go first  i want to go with you i am going to jump when you jump  i am not jumping without you  you know throughout this whole journey  one of my biggest fears has been  will i be accepted for who i am  i think i am too scared  you got this  but i have to remind myself  how loving and supportive erich has been  every time we are together  you can do it  and right now  he is definitely doing it again  trying to give me courage to take the leap  and he does make me feel really safe  deep breath deep breath and then you go   i am going to go okay  do not think just go  whoo  okay yeah  whoo  i am not always the most adventurous  yeah whoo  but jumping off of the highest landing  was really incredible  and having erich s support makes it so much easier  it makes me feel so loved and that we can do  lots of hard things together  and honestly that is what i want in my husband  cheers to a great day  cheers cheers for jumping  i would not have been so freaked out  if i like would have went faster but  you did it that is all that matters  yeah  i feel like the last time i saw you was so long ago  me too  i was really looking forward to seeing you  especially after like  how good our date was with your family  yeah  i felt like so good leaving there  like it was not an easy day obviously  yeah  but like i really wanted you to be there  i knew it was not going to be easy for me to like  make it through that day yeah  to see my dad and like i told you afterwards  like he is not he is really not doing that well  yeah i am so sorry and like being there  and then leaving quickly was just like damn  i know i did not want to leave  and then to sit there and like watch you drive away  it was like so dramatic and i was like damn  i know it was  i am like getting emotional aww  no i know i always say like thank you  but really it means like so much that you are here  and i think seeing your family put everything in perspective  and so i understand how hard it is for you  and how hard it must be  so i hope you know how much i do appreciate you  and i did not know that i needed to like hear how you felt  but it was so good to hear  and i do i feel like it brought us  like so much closer just like everything  yeah i appreciate that  being here is not easy  but it is like moments like this  that i am like i like need to be here  i need to be here with you  today with erich was definitely as good  as i hoped maybe even better  i mean it is always felt easy with erich  but i feel like there were moments  where he was able to really support me as a true partner  i love being wrapped around him  i love when he holds me  i love kissing him in the middle of the cenote  i feel like i did not want it to end  now we are here and this has to last forever now  so i am not leaving  i am so happy  going into tonight s dinner  i am excited for us to really lay  everything out on the table  the more time i spend with erich  the easier it is for me to really see my life with him  i think tonight will really help with that  we know we are at that point in our relationship  and i think it could be just what i need  to really see myself engaged to him  and you know at the end of this  i just want to crawl inside you  you do look unbelievable  oh my gosh thank you  being with erich today was amazing  it was easy and natural  and comfortable and so much fun  i felt really connected to him  and tonight there is a potential  to spend the night together  so i am excited  tonight i want to push us  into being honest with our feelings  i know it is scary as hell and i think  honestly the overnight portion of it  is where it becomes the most real  is not it cute  but before we commit to that you know  i need to know where he stands  will he be able to give me unconditional love  and accept me for me  i am taking this jacket off  i like how you leave it unbuttoned  so i am hoping that tonight with erich  i can be all the different sides of myself in one breath  i was really looking forward to seeing you  thinking that hometown was not easy  yeah  and then to see you today i was like  we finally have this time like just us  like you said there is no family involved for once   i was like this is actually going to be amazing  and then next thing you know we are doing something  that i really freaking like to do  which is scare myself yeah  and to see you scared too i was like this is perfect  well i did not want to make a big deal out of it  and then it became a big deal  but i feel like you were like so supportive  and so patient with me  and i really appreciate that  yeah  i think after our hometown and you know  seeing you with my family i could not have expected it  to go as well as it did  and the thing that i did not tell you  was that my family is obsessed with you  and i just could not have imagined  and i them  i can i am not up there being like wow  this is freaking amazing but like to hear that from them  is like the ultimate validation to be like  this girl is amazing  and i am just so ridiculously attracted to you  and i could not wait to see you after that  definitely like walking in  i think i had to get my bearings and stuff too  but after a second it was like so easy  like with your dad  with your mom and with your sister  they i think welcomed me so much  to where i can really see myself as a part  of your family and it  i think i have probably told you a little bit about it  but my growing up was  just really different  in that my parents like separated early  and my dad was still active duty in the air force  so he moved away  for a lot of years i would just see him  for christmas and summers  and my mom was working two jobs  and they had us real young  so i did a lot of growing up on my own  and like there were times growing up  when i did have to change who i was  in order to receive love as a child  yeah  and my mom and i do not really have a relationship  but i know she did the best she could growing up  it is just kind of complicated and messy  but looking at your family it is like  it is so nice to see  you know you guys really are a whole  not like parts of a whole  yeah yeah  as hard as it is i mean i can respect so much about you  and knowing where you came from and how like strong you are  and how emotionally intelligent you are  and how you handle situations  like i just  i do not know i cannot imagine  going through what you have gone through  and you turned out so amazing that  you are a beautiful person  aww  thank you  so  like last week you know i told you  i was falling in love with you and we left europe  and i was like falling for you  and then i watched you leave in that suv  and i was just like this is when it starts  to really hurt when you have to like get torn apart  and i do not get to see you again for however long  and i do not know how long it is  so i spend that time in between just thinking about us  and how much this relationship means to me  and how much i hope it means to you  and i am kind of past the point  where it is like i m falling for you  i m falling in love with you  like i am love in with you gabby  and i do not want to leave here without you  you are so sweet  i do really see a future with you  you have a way of making me feel like  really safe no matter what  and i really really appreciate you  and like i am falling in love with you  i really am  i feel like i am weightless  like the happiest person in the whole world  when erich said that he was in love with me  it felt so right  it means a lot it really does i know  he is taught me so much about myself  and that i can be loved  and that he is ready to love me for me  i am just so excited to be falling in love with him  and to share it with him  there is something for you  it is a surprise  okay   gabby and erich love is really a leap of faith  hopefully you both felt that today  out in the beautiful mexican countryside  if you choose to take this next leap  please use this key to stay as a couple in the fantasy suite  jesse  what do you think  obviously yes  i am so happy right now  you know i am in love with gabby  and you know i told her that i love her  and for me it was a huge weight lifted off my chest  thank you  and now i get the most meaningful time with her  with just us  like i am just so excited  being loved by erich just feels really incredible  it is what i have been waiting for for so long  i just want to hold on to it for as long as i can  oh my god it is big  we finally get to like revel in each other and be together  oh oh is there a hot tub  oh dear god  oh my god  this is insane  so i want to she would every last wall  this is really nice  i want to give both of us the chance  to really feel each other s love  when i am with him like i want to be with him  and i can see myself with him forever  and every time we kiss  the world really does melt away  and for once i feel like the future  is going to be so so good  whoa whoa  right make some breakfast  mm hmm are you going to make me cook  no i feel like i should cook  waking up this morning it was amazing  you know we spent this incredible night together  i got to just see the raw gabby and have conversations  and she is everything and more than what i thought  she is to me a person i am obsessed with  am i doing this wrong  yes  and it is like mind boggling that i had the opportunity  to spend the night with her and have  this like crazy off camera experience  you know i have thrown myself out there  and told her that i love her  and for me that is like that is all of me  so going into the rest of this week  i am going to try not to think about everything  i mean the reality is it sucks  that there are other relationships happening  i love spending time with you  this was sad  i know thinking about things like her  in you know the fantasy suites with these other guys  it is just not going to be healthy for me  i know how i get  i get really in my head and i am not  like a super jealous person but you know  when you have crazy feelings for somebody  it is going to hurt to know that there are  other people still there  do you know how i feel  confused  you think i am confused  i think i am confused  why i do not know  what do you mean  i feel like you know  that just being with you is so easy  and it does it feels like i have known you  for so much longer than i have  waking up this morning with erich i feel  i do not know a lot  are you going to miss me  i am so going to miss you i am going to cry in the shower  i am definitely  more than falling in love with erich  i really think i am in love with him  and i know he deserves to know but i know how strong  those words are and i want to be able honestly  to tell just one person at the end of this  and i can definitely see it being him  but i know i have to save it for the right moment  i hope you know i do not want to let you go  i believe you  i am here i know  and i know what you are feeling  and i know it is not like okay but  please just be patient with me   i mean undeniably when i am with him  like i want to be with him and i can  see myself with him forever  and i hope that that feeling holds up  but i am scared that it will not  i will miss the hell out of you  i will miss you more  i will see you soon yeah  okay  i have a pit in my stomach  i get up nerves on what you are going to do when you walk away  i am just going to keep walking the way back to new jersey  i did not want to say goodbye  i wanted to spend the whole day with him  so i know my heart s in the right place  but there is also just this heaviness of  i have more work to do on myself  and the other men that are here  you know what if i have this same exact thing  with somebody else  and then what  you too  i will see you soon  i want to be able to say you know  i want to be engaged to him because i know it is him  but i do not know  bye gabby okay  bye  i am going to throw up  bye  you know i almost did not want to leave  but you know one thing she said is just be patient  i m here for you but you know  this is incredibly painful  because what if she is falling in love  with johnny and jason as well  it is hard to think about that  so i am taking her advice  and i am not going to get emotional  i am not going to cry in the shower anymore  i am just going to be patient and look forward  to the next time i see her and hopefully it is soon  this week is really hard  i know i am falling in love with rachel  and it is so hard feeling this strongly about her  knowing she is on an overnight with one of the other guys  it is just beyond me at times that like  she is like even exploring other physical connections  i cannot imagine her wanting to spend  the night with anybody else  this is just torture  it is like being in the twilight zone  even just talking about it now makes me want to throw up  hi hi  i missed you  hi i missed you too  it is so good to see you  it is so good to see you again  you look beautiful thank you  my gosh oh my gosh  well i have such a fun date planned  you know the water is really blue  so i figured we should check it out together  what do you think i am so in  i want to do whatever today are you excited  i am so excited  i am so excited to spend this day with aven  he is definitely someone i was really interested  right off the bat  okay let us go amazing  you look so good  he is so attractive and just an amazing person  he really is just the complete package  and i do feel so lucky that he is with me here today  this is our ride today wow  you want to go see  yeah i am in let us go and check it out  rachel looks beautiful as always  she is extremely attractive it is overwhelming sometimes  and i am excited  this is so cool  look at all this  there is a hot tub  you are kidding i know  so i am really looking forward to today  i cannot believe how clear this water is  you want me to put sunscreen on you  yeah you want me to put some on you  yeah can you get my back yeah  the more and more i have gotten to spend time with rachel  i continue to see her as somebody that i can spend  the rest of my life with  and last week at my hometown  i told her i was falling in love with her  so hopefully this week is about going  where this is potentially going to end  and the end is an engagement  cheers to building on what we already have  so cheers to you cheers  and to this week and being in mexico  last week when aven told me he is falling in love with me  i felt so happy  but i did not say it back  i was still in a headspace  where i did not want to say anything  to anyone until the very end  just because the love word is a really big word  that was used by clayton really just carelessly  when i was on the other side  but this week i am in charge of how i want to move forward  and after today i really hope to be ready to take that step  mm  how are we going to get tired of that   so much has happened this week  but it is just like crazy  and like my head s everywhere  it all started with my overnight date  johnny and i decided that this was not the right time with us  i knew that he cannot give me what i deserve  and it was time to say goodbye  during our overnight erich and i s relationship  has grown really strong  a couple days ago leaving our morning together  i felt so good about him  like he really could be the one for me  but then he of that up last night  erich was telling me how much he loved me  and how hard it is for him especially this week  because this week felt like cheating to him  and i know that because in fantasy suites  when it was just him and i  we had the same exact conversation  and going through all those emotions multiple times  is exhausting  my first gut reaction was why are we rehashing this now  mm hmm we had already  talked about it  like when it was just me and you  was not that enough and did not that mean more  you sort of have that dropped on you  at a moment you were not expecting it  right it is unfair to me  i did not get any sleep  i was still so confused and i felt so hurt  and i do not think i really understood  where he was coming from so  i am sorry you know that happened  i just know you guys shared  a lot of really special moments together  yeah  i was definitely disappointed because  i felt like i was being almost pressured into a decision  and i know myself i just need a lot of space  in order to be able to think  um oh i do not want to cry  but i think like this whole time  it has been just really hard because i have wanted  to make a right decision like for myself and for them  and like erich and i have like gone through so much  we do not have the best way of communicating  but he has like always fought for me  and i think i have always fought for him  erich and i we have always struggled  with this miscommunication but i think  we are also very different people  i am mad at him because i still have  my overnight date with jason  i felt like i was being pressured  so i am like this is this is it you know  we are not meant to be  like i knew it was too good to be true  it is not easy  so you can see how you could feel that way  yeah  i have to be honest with myself  and if it is my decision to be with erich it is mine  and if it is my decision to be with jason  like it is nobody else  i want this to be my decision  i am around if you need me okay  sounds good all right gabby  we will see ya okay  i do not really know like where to go from here or what to do  but i know i just have to continue to follow my heart  today is my overnight date with jason  i do just want to like soak up these moments  we have with each other  i am falling in love with him  and this overnight date is so important  i am hoping that it just brings us together  and that we can see ourselves  one step closer to an engagement  i know there is no question to his intentions  that is a big day for us  i am here for gabby  when i am with her like i just have an amazing time  and like we get each other on like a deeper level too  i am just kind of reflecting on this past hometown date  i started feeling that i am not at a place  where i am ready to get engaged  i am doing my best to stay true to myself and just for me  it just does not feel right  i need to tell gabby where i stand  and be honest with her  i am nervous  i am stressed out  i have no idea how she is going to react  this week has been pretty hard up until this point  but today i get to focus on the overnight date with jason  i really cannot wait to see him  hey   i am falling in love with jason  and i believe he feels the same way  but he has not been able to tell me how he feels  hi  i have been looking forward to this day  because i know he is such a private person  it is so good to see you  you too  there is an option you know for an overnight  where we can just get really private time  and have some intimacy to see if we are truly  as compatible as i think we are  our whole relationship could change tonight  okay well welcome to mexico  it is so good to see you  you too it is been so long  it is crazy it feels like a year  i know so what do we do  go to the all you can eat buffet  actually yeah  well no there is something  and um it is something i am really good at  that you maybe have never done before  but i am excited for us to learn and grow together  what is it so do you want to see  yeah let us go okay we will see  i am nervous  i am nervous do not be nervous  no  we are playing tennis  oh god  i thought we were going to be dancing  no no  i was ready to dance or something  i know i sold it i m good at it  so jason and i are playing tennis today  which is something that he loves  he played tennis in college  and i want to be able to share of the passions  that my partner has  so i am excited for him to like teach me  and see him in his element  i did it you missed it  no we are supposed to go back and forth  that was good  oh there you go  oh my god i am so good  getting on the tennis court with gabby was amazing  and i kind of was just in the moment  and she was good  she was actually like a natural  do you think i am good  i think you are like the best player i have ever seen  no  i want him to actually hit me in my butt with the racket  so hot  we will see  teach me how to serve  that is all i care about  i will teach you how to serve yeah  why do you have so many balls  because you are going to need them  let us go to that side though  the sun  what what  jason and i are just like so easy together  you know we are just doing something kind of mundane  like tennis but somehow we make it so fun  i feel like i never have to explain myself  i can just like be whoever i want to be  get low  like this  i cannot stay low  no that is it right there  i did not say to be a crab  i said get low  i think like we just get each other  and accept each other for who we are  damn that was fast  that was actually good  that was like  miles per hour  yeah i think today was just like kind of  what i needed just like to feel  feel at home a little bit  we should do target practice yeah what is that  we have to hit the water bottle  okay let me get up here  okay fine  i did it oh what  i had more fun today than i could have imagined  it just felt special  if there was any date i could ask for  today was what i would want  honestly i think you are ready to go pro  you are amazing  but yeah in the back of my mind  there is this big conversation tonight  about the future for us outside of this  at the end of the day like i might not be having  the same path as some of the other guys  but i know what feels good to me  and seems like we are both feeling good  i am dying  should we change into our swimsuits and go to the pool  please please  do we get in yes  let us go  are we cannonballing yeah sure  yeah ready yeah  all right let us go it is not very deep  ah  i cannot stop thinking about gabby  the last time you know i saw her  um i let my insecurities kind of get the best of me  ah you are so strong  i brought up her other fantasy suites  and she was upset  makes me think like i do not necessarily know where we are  ultimately at the end of the day like  my biggest fear is like losing her now so  like this week i know when i am just by myself  she is on a date with somebody else  and like has a relationship with somebody else   i know how special our date was and for her to experience  that with somebody else now at this point  just feels like weird  okay okay  okay ah  this has been like by far the hardest week  because i have told her how i feel truly  so now to feel this strongly about somebody  and know that like you can lose that person  that is a horrible feeling  how was it talking to my mom and  she was like so nice we got along easy  i told her i do not know things i saw in you  and like how good you were and are with me  i was telling her how like genuine and real you are  and she was like no i can tell like instantly  oh that is good like she is  i think she is your number one fan  aw oh my god that means a lot  when you were outside we were like talking  about touching up our roots and stuff  like that is how i know it is real  yeah like she gets me  yeah but no this is so much fun  i did have fun i just like being with you  yeah that is what i said too  like every time i am with you it is just like  no matter what we do it is fun  yeah it is a strange place  but when i am with you it feels normal  that is what i think yeah  you know i cannot wait for these dates  it is the best i know me either  every time i see you it is like no time has passed  today has been such a great day  and being with him just really feels  like completely effortless in every sense  i think it has really exceeded all my expectations  i know we have fun together  but this is like more than fun  it is really just comfort  you are so salty you are salty  i am truly falling in love with him  going into dinner tonight i am hoping that jason and i  can talk more about our feelings  i know my feelings are really strong  and i can definitely see him at the end of this with me  after today i just know it is going to work for us  going into dinner with jason tonight  i am really excited  i think today i really did not know  where my head was going to be at  but like jason just gets it  i can see myself engaged to jason  i think that we would really balance each other  i mean he really is everything i have ever wanted  it is so nice out tonight  that is what is so good here  today was definitely amazing  like there is real feelings here  i think like each date that we have together  deepens my feelings for gabby  i feel like we are heading in the right direction  this is us  i know this is actually nice  but i have not really been able to like  put it all out on the table so that she knows  exactly where i stand  thank you  i just want to be up front with her  and let her know that i am not ready to get engaged  being authentic and transparent with gabby  is all i want to do  and yeah tonight i think will be the first time that like  i can really share where i am at  thank you for today  oh thank you it was fun it was such a good day  cheers  i do not know like i am just kind of curious  what she is going to say and um how she will take it  like hopefully hopefully well  yeah today was it was fun  like i was first day that like  felt like totally normal and like  a real day outside of this  yeah  i felt like i was like fully present the entire time  and like not thinking about like everything going on  and it just felt good so  no yeah me too  i feel like we can kind of do anything  but today was like so easy  yeah um i think it is  yeah it is never it is never been easy for me here but  yeah no totally  how has your time been like after seeing your family  and it is like a weird transition i feel  yeah  seeing my family was it was great you know  but it is such a short time to see them  and then you obviously want to like keep that going  but then you come back here and like  it is kind of like a tease yeah   and then like i came here and like was spending  like a week just like by yourself  kind of by myself yeah i know  and just like wanting to like looking forward to today  yeah yeah this  i think i have kind of told you how like crazy  and weird this has been for me but like  it actually has like it is been so challenging  in so many ways but um  i think it just speaks a lot about like your character  and that you do know yourself and like it is okay  to be uncomfortable here  and i am so happy you are still here  and it means like so much to me  honestly this whole time i have just tried to focus  on you and like me and you  and it is kind of all that matters to me but uh  yeah i think obviously tonight  like i wanted to talk to you kind of just like  how i am feeling and stuff and i want to be fully honest  and transparent because that is kind of like  what i have wanted to do this entire time  and um you know obviously i do know that i am into you  and like i when i am with you i feel um  like i am having some of the best days ever  and i know like what the expectation of this is  for you know a lot of people is like being engaged  and like being fully in love and like  yeah  to be like completely transparent and honest  i i do not think i am fully there yet  um i think it is because in this environment  like it is like constantly in my head  like what is real what is not real  i am like i am like questioning so many things  yeah i just i do not think in another seven days  i will be ready for for that  like it is just not something like in my heart  that feels right  and i just want to be like fully transparent  and let you know how i feel  i know honestly like i know how hard it is for you  and i know it is like a big expectation and  but i do not also know like if you are  i guess at a place in your life  where you can see me  like with you at all in the future  or like what  it is so hard for me to like see that right now  within this bubble because like i feel like  you do not even know who i am completely  and like i do not fully feel like i know who you are  yeah i would love to kind of like hear how you feel too  yeah  um i think obviously like  i think yeah i think there is honestly like a part of you  that has to decide whether  um you are like able  to believe in kind of this like hopeless romanticism  for me i am more of a realist  i do not think it is like this is not real  but like it is been hard for me to like feel at ease  with cameras and microphones and stuff  but yeah  yeah i know  i think it is just like hard because if you kind of feel  like you do not really know me  how can you like really make a promise  like yeah  he was always someone i saw myself with  from the very beginning  so to wait this long to hear where he is at  like definitely hurts  it is just like  i guess that there was a piece of me that wanted him  to play along for like just a second  but he cannot  i just like knew it was going to happen  like i have to be honest with myself you know  maybe it just is you know a love  that is not destined to be together   tonight at dinner a lot of things were said to me  jason said he is highly uncomfortable here  and he said that he is not ready for a proposal  it would have been good to know before now  unlike you know other people who can kind of  be themselves fully like he cannot  and it is a huge disadvantage for him  and i do not know like why we are here  together if it is that hard  but this is where we are at so i do not know  i just feel upset  i am just trying to stay true to myself  and like it is obvious she was upset about what i told her  yeah are you okay  i do not i do not know  i definitely do not want to like just walk away from this  like i truly feel like a unique connection to her and like  i just want to be sure she knows how i feel  this is truly i cannot tell you how challenging  this has been for me  like i was about to go home  like you are the reason i stayed  like i am literally here for you and i am serious  like i would not be here if you were not here  yeah today was like a really special day  that i truly felt like was just a big step  in our relationship and something  that i think we can really build on  and i am excited for that if i can get the chance so  i do not know  there is just like a part of me that is like  are we like pulling at strings kind of  no i think like i totally see us getting  to a point like in real life  like where we can spend time together  i just do not know  i do not know  like i truly feel like a unique connection to you  that i have not in a while and like when i am with you  like i do feel good about this and like  i see that as something special  that could turn into like a serious relationship  and like hopefully that by the end of this  like that is where we are at  and i truly care about you too and like you truly  like mean a lot to me yeah  i see like in you like somebody that kind of  just gets it  i am feeling conflicted  i think now i have to decide like  whether it is worth moving forward or not  jason did tell me like he can see a future with me  i do not want to say goodbye to him  because i am not ready because i know  what is in front of me is so precious  are you okay yeah  i do not know i truly just want to know  like what you think because like i do want to  be on like the same page  i do not i mean maybe i like appeared upset  because i do really care for you and i did not know  if that was maybe it for us  like i was not ready to like say goodbye in that moment  then after talking to you more  i do not think it was ever for me like  he doesn t like believe in me  i do really care about you too  and like i think we do have like a really  solid foundation that could build into something  outside of this  i think being off camera and like being  you know private in privacy will help me like understand  like the situation and like maybe  i can like hear you better  and like you can hear me better  i agree like we do just need tonight  yeah  and it is just like a night unlike any other  that you can truly just like share things with each other  and really get to know each other  in a way that is not really possible otherwise here so  do you want to like spend the rest of the night  kind of trying to figure this out   and to be honest i thought what  i was seeing was not the real  rachel  i felt like i was seeing  bachelorette rachel not the  real rachel that i would come to  know and love  okay  his look when he asked her to  walk out he just looked like  pretty  upset  yeah  interesting  i guess he kind of saw it as a  now or never  you know at this point late  in the stage where i expressed  and shown like my absolute  love  yeah  for you and i feel upset and  disappointed that i was not able  to get that from you  i do understand maybe you  were picking up on a little bit  of a different vibe  i have been trying to gain  clarity this week as well and i  do really feel like i did find  it  i felt like the concerns with  the age part  yeah  was a complete kind of  blindside  i was just trying to find  that missing piece for me  and i did think if we could just  spend the night talking that  maybe i could find it  it is just it is kind of hard  to wrap my head around it  yeah i did really love you  you know  i saw a future with you  but i need to go  i truly need you to know that  i wish i could have gotten th  there  but you know a relationship  is a two way road and you  know i cannot make it any other  way  at least now we know  oh jeez louise  that would be i believe  zach getting walked out if you  are reading this correctly too  yeah that is what it is  looking like  this is awkward  that is really sad  honestly this is so sad  it is over just like that  just like that  i can see in her eyes that it  really meant something different  to her than it did to me  i do not know what i missed  i mean i saw it that night in  the fantasy suite that it was  off  i do not know  but like it still does not feel  real  like she was in my mind  the future mrs shallcross  oh my goodness  i am so sorry  um zach left  i do wish him the best  i do not really want to speak  ill  but for people who especially  say that they care about me to  kind of take things into their  own hands and question my  character it is obviously really  disappointing  i do not really have any other  words  her response it felt so  cold that i thought maybe that i  meant more but i guess i  did not  tino  tino will you accept this rose  always  one of the things i fell in  love with was like she made me  feel  like special  and cared for  and  i question if any of that was  real  if that was just an act  aven  aven will you accept this rose  absolutely  oh   obviously that was really  hard to watch  are you doing okay  when we come back you will get a  chance to speak to zach for the  first time since that day in  mexico  bachelor nation do not go away  we will be right back  welcome back to the live  finale of the bachelorette  i am here with rachel  gabby is stil here but she is  stepped away to give rachel some  space  you look nervous  are you doing okay  i am ready to talk to zach  i am ready  ladies and gentlemen please  welcome zach  good to see you  zach it is great having you  here  i know you have not seen or  spoken to rachel since that day  in mexico  would you like to say to her  wow great seeing you  it is been a long time  little nervous little nervous  of course  i just want to say that i do  apologize for ever making you  feel like i called you out for  your character  watching that back books the  last thing i wanted  that is the last thing i wanted  i was kind of in shock and  disbelief in what was happening  between us  i am so sorry  i am sorry too  i really want you to know that  obviously there was really hard  for me to watch back and see you  emotional and i want you to know  that those feelings that i had  they were real  i do not ever want you to feel  like i was putting on an act or  anything i do apologize as well  take us back to the rose  ceremony when you decided to  leave and walk away  how hard of a that  i was sick to my stomach the  whole week  i knew from our night of the  fantasy suite it felt off  the days leading up to the  rose ceremony i was constantly  feeling that thing in my  stomach  i had to share what i was  feeling i did not want to hide  that from you  it was the toughest week  granted things happened the way  they did and that is okay  that is what was meant to be  it was a tough difficult  situation for us both  again i am sorry  i could have handled it better  rachel safe to say that you  look pretty stunned and caught  off guard  do you feel like you said  everything you needed to say or  is there something you want  displayed to zach  i really want you to know  that you meant so much to me  i care about you and i really do  want all the happiness in the  world for you  everything that happened it was  awkward and i am sorry  i was really just looking for  clarity and i wanted us to be  able to have that night to see  if we could get there  ultimately i just could not  but i never want you to feel  like i was going to put you  through something like that if  it was not a truly to see if we  could come out on the other  side  i am sorry  i get that  there is no one way or right way  to navigate it  it was a tough pill to swallow  it was not what i thought it was  going to be because i saw a  future with you  the reality of it was that it  just was not going to happen and  that was a hard thing to rea  realize  i just want you to be happy  i am glad see you after all of  this time  things were going  it is good to hear you say that  things were going so well  between the two of you up until  that overnight date  i think for a lot of people  they are wondering if something  nefarious or something crazy man  happened behind close doors in  the overnight date for the  relationship to come crashing  down the way he did  what did happen that might  rachel please correct me if  i am wrong  it was one of those moments when  the fantasy suite started we  were in there and talking  it kind of felt immediately off  he felt like we were kind of two  strangers in a way  i think it was the moment that i  did not fully recognize at the  time but maybe you had already  realized i was not going to be   your future person  we have the rest of the night to  still hang out and be together  and it was tough  it was not until the days after  where it was all right i need  to share my feelings  about how there is not an us  it started off early in the  fantasy suite and it was a  tough tough conversation  it was just off  felt like two very different  people  does that sound about right  i do again want you to know  watching it back i was never  accusing you of not being ready  and i do not want you to feel as  if i was coming after you  i just wanted to know if you are  ready in general which is when  i asked everyone  i want you to know that is where  i was coming from  i was hoping we could have  cleared up in the morning but i  do know that it was awkward for  both of us  maybe there was a  miscommunication  but i really just want you to  know that i was never like  trying to make it awkward  i know  it was tough  it was really tough  there is no way t way to navigat  the right way  you did an admirable job and i  was trying to handle it when i  could  do the best i could  i unfortunately failed  it is okay  you have had some time to  process it  thinking back to that day in  mexico  do you have any regrets walking  away  you know  i do not really have any regrets  the moments i shared with  you rachel being in l a all  the way to amsterdam i will never  forget those memories  mexico was great until it wa  was not  i would not trade anything in the  world  everything happens for a reason  so it was great getting to know  you  rachel how about you  any regrets  zach you are such an  incredible guy  you truly made this experience  for me  i know it did not work out  exactly what we might have  thought in the moment but i just  want you to know how much i  appreciate you and i really do  appreciate this conversation  honestly  right zach  before we move on any last  words that you have for rachel  again  the memories we shared together  i will never forget them  i really just hope you are happy  and i want the best for you  always  you are awesome  feel like you got some  closure  i know it is hard to do to  relive it  thank you for your honesty and  while it did not work out for you  romantically it is obvious you  have a lot of mutual respect  i love seeing that  thank you both so much  zach thank you  right when we return the  remaining guys meet rachel s and  gabby s families  things do not go exactly as  planned  we will be right back  welcome back to  the backelorette live finale  it is already been an emotional  night and it is about to get even  more emotional  i am here right now with rachel  and gabby who are watching along  with everyone else and it is  time for their guys to meet  their families  are you ready to do this  here we go  i am just excited to see her  it is just been a really long  time  yeah  i just cannot wait to touch  her you know  are you going to cry  i am hoping not to but we will  see  do you know you are going to  ask tony  we know you are the big scary  one so  no  hey  oh my baby girl  oh i am just so excited  i cannot believe it is already  time for like them to meet  everyone  i missed you so much  i missed you  hi  i have a family and two  best friends who are very  opinionated and who will not be  afraid to tell me how they feel  i really just hope that they see  what i see because having my  family s approval is huge  i feel like there is this like  big stigma or like pressure  about my dad and big tony   like i know they are probably  freaking out  oh my gosh  so  what is new  so what is new  you are smiling  i am dying here  who who who  so this has been the craziest  thing ever  this was not easy  but i do have two incredible  people for you to meet  and i want you guys to know that  i am so happy  i guess really what i am looking  for just in general is clarity  because i am a bit conflicted  i have talked to both of them  about engagement and a life  after this and what would it  look like  and i do really like have  these feelings for both of them  and i could see my life with  both of them  do they both want kids  they do  yes  okay  so today you will be meeting  aven  and tomorrow you will be meeting  tino  okay  immediately i knew i really  liked aven like i even told  gabby i am like i like this  one  when you see him you are  genuinely going to be like why  do you look like that  it is almost like it hurts your  feelings  okay right  he is someone that i trust  completely and like i know is  here for me and i know he is  ready  has he said anything to you  he told me he is falling in  love with me  he just has something  like you guys know my big thing  is like support and like  someone who is going to be  supportive  and there were crazy things that  would happen and the first  thing i would say is i just need to  see aven  like he just makes me feel  so  that is huge rach  supported  that is huge  i like the way you are  explaining who we are going to  meet because this is really  making it so much easier for us  so you are doing a great job of  telling us everything we want to  know  i am going to go get aven  i am excited  and i will be back in a minute  look at that face  i am so excited  i am just excited to really  talk about our relationship and  i am so excited to hear what they  have to say and i really just  hope it is all positive  aven told me he is ready  for an engagement  so i am very confident in aven  meeting my family  hi  hi beautiful  how are you  you look so good  you do too  how are you  hi  good to see you  what is up  hi  how are you feeling  i am good  i am excited a little nervous  do not be nervous  i know  i just know how you are feeling  now  like it is a real thing  it will be okay  i know how important her  parents are to rachel and i am  really excited for today  i hope it really goes well  you ready to go  everything  i am good everything  okay  grab my hand  hello  how are you guys  hi everyone  how is it going  this is aven  how are you doing  great to meet you  i am aven  i want it to work between us and  get to a point of starting a  life together and all of that  so you know family is a big  factor into those decisions  big day  huge  nice to meet you  yeah i was really looking  forward to meeting you guys  this is amazing  i really appreciate it  oh i have something for you  too  i almost forgot it is in my  pocket  there you go  thank you  thank you very much  my wife will be really excited  about this  oh my gosh  yeah this is finally here  i have heard a lot about you guys  did it go by quick for you  it went by really quick  but we have like done a lot  together  up to this point so it feels  slow at the same time  it is like a weird thing  you know  yeah  to be at this point it is  just very special especially  she is met my family too  we talk all the time about how  important this is so i really  appreciate it  she is very special to me  it is just an honor to meet you   well we are really happy to  meet you too  yeah we are excited  i appreciate it  slightly nervous  yeah it is a nerve racking  experience but like after  hearing everything rachel said  about you before you came in  it was nice  some good stuff  some nice things  see if you can get big tony  to smile  trying my hardest  i gave him a cigar  we are getting somewhere  trying  i have been looking forward to  it but you are always nervous  because you know you want to  make a good impression  you want to really remind them  you know why you are here and  how you feel towards you know  their daughter  let us go talk  the first thing i said to  rachel is i do not want to end  up on big tony s bad side  so you think i am going to not be  honest with that guy  me and rachel are falling in  love with each other  i know that you know rachel  sees something in me and a  future with me the same way i do  with her  i think today is like  a big day to prove that  i am here to put you on the  spot because you know i do not  want to hear somebody mumbling  around  absolutely  i want to know why you know  this is my daughter  she is my pride and joy  and nobody is going to take her  away from me without a fight  of course  so tomorrow i am going to be  sitting in this chair there is  going to be a different guy   sitting in that chair  yeah  so what are you going to say  today that is going to make me  remember you better than the  other guy  yeah i mean i think you know  one thing i have really tried to  be as open as honest and as  myself through all of this  i consider rachel s  feelings in every decision i have  made going through this because  this is not like a joke to me  this is my life just as much as  it is hers and i want to make  sure that if we end up together  that it is right for both of us  what are your feelings  because she told me her feelings  about you  what are your feelings about  her  absolutely  so i am going to put you on  the spot now  absolutely  so i can see that we shared a  lot of the same values which  was so important  same sense of humor  you know we laugh together  she is obviously you know  i think she is gorgeous all of  that stuff  so it was pretty much everything  for me all combined at once  i communicated to her after my  hometown that i am falling in  love with her  i am falling in love with your  daughter  and the feelings are so strong  and it is been a progression  for us  we have built on every single  moment we have had together  i want to stress to you just  about how strongly i do feel  towards rachel  so what is your like initial  first impression of him  oh i like him  yeah  yeah  he seems very sweet  i mean i like the way he sat  and was right away holding hands  with you and the way he was  interacting with us he seemed  pretty confident  yeah  with aven i just feel like i  trust him  if we were to be at the end of  this and aven was to get down on  one knee he would be the most  incredible partner and i know  that for sure  for sure  i have like no doubts in him  i love hearing you say that  i like that  he is so incredible  he is so great  rachel i love the way you are  talking  i can see it  it is overflowing  i am so so happy  i feel like all the answers i  need i know  so i am just hoping he can like  tell you from his side how he  feels and see what matches up  right and you think he is  ready to get down on one knee  yes  okay good  we talked about it  at length  okay  yeah  oh my gosh  i love that face  you are so happy  i know i am so happy yeah  you know i thought it was  going to be weird  you know my daughter is getting  engaged and i met the guy one  time  how weird that is you know  but the more i am talking to you  the more confidence you are  giving me so wow  it is a little wild for me to  think that in a couple days  she will be engaged  but she was just gushing  there was no things that i had  to question her on  she was just happy  so i guess this is kind of  like the big question but one  have you said that you were  falling in love or in love with  rachel  yeah i have told  i expressed to rachel after my  hometown that i am falling in  love with her  okay  yeah  i guess now like the next  step this engagement could  potentially happen so soon  like in a matter of days  where are you  do you think that could happen  i want to be with rachel at  the end of this like i want to  have a life with her  and i want the engagement aspect  of it to be perfect  because for me like seeing  what my parents went through  i want it to be a one time shot  for us  but like  can you tell us are you there  but what i was going to say  is like i can like see  myself getting there  do you have enough time to  get there  i do not know  i do not know how much time we  have left  but i am falling in love with  her and my feelings are very  strong  how does it feel that i could  be engaged in five days  i think i will be so i am going  to be engaged in five days  i am going to say that very  confidently  you know i will take it  one day at a time  i feel like he really is in  that place where he is ready  when i tell you everything i  want in a partner i feel like  he embodies all of that  a father wants to hear that  i do not want to put my guard  down already but i liked him  just because of the way you were  talking about him  i love seeing you that happy  when you walk above the ground  as far as like wanting to  be with her after this is  like a no doubt my mind  and getting to a point of a  marriage and a life together is  something i want with her  it is just about the timing  of it  have you said that to her  i have expressed that to her  have you said i don t know  that i want to get engaged at  the end of this  i have expressed that i am ready  for an engagement  like as far as my life is  concerned like where i am at in  life  she is ready for an  engagement  she talks about it all the time  and if she comes home not  engaged that is going to be  really hard  yeah  well i think ultimately it  is a red flag  it is not her intention to come  home with a boyfriend  i do think aven not wanting to  be engaged at the end of this  process will be a deal breaker  engagement is no joke  a marriage is no joke  i just know that is her   intention  yeah  so just to keep that in mind  do you wish you could date  the most eligible bachelors and  bachelorettes in america  you can  applied to be on the bachelor  go to abc com casting now  welcome back to the live  finale of the bachelorette  i am here with our studio  audience and of course  gabby and rachel  i love seeing big tony in that  pink shirt he was wearing  that is all everybody is talking  about on social media  realmenwearpink  we watched as aven revealed he  might not be ready to get  engaged  is that going to be a  deal breaker for rachel  let us find out  so tell me everything  tell me everything  right  i feel like this week like  i gained so much clarity in my  overnights  and like i would never bring  aven here if i genuinely like  did not see this future with him  and if he did not feel like this  could be my husband  not only could it be  but i see it  mm hmm  today is just as amazing as i  thought it would be  my family loves aven  i am ready for an engagement  they know how big of a deal this  is for me so i could not be  happier  on paper  mm hmm he is the perfect guy  he is the choice  like if you do not choose him  you are stupid  and it is the way that you  like say like when you are in  a stressful situation you look  for him  like you want that  that is valuable  speaking on aven  after talking with him  i was going to say did you  guys ask him  did you kill him  did he kill him  no he did not  he just said he just was  unsure that like there would  be an engagement at the end  like he could not give an  answer  he could not give me an answer  i do not know if he is  necessarily ready for an  engagement but the way  that he let me finish before  you freak out  but like the way he words it  is he knows he wants to be with  you  i think he is being very logical  about this  he said i want rachel in my life  forever  he is like that is not a  question  it is like do we get engaged  right away  with her completely g honest  he is like  yeah but this is like  shocking because this is not  what he told me  he told us that he told you  of this  i mean he told me he is like  i feel confident like  ready  like i feel good  like i would never bring him in  front of you if i did not think  someone was like ready  this is like shocking  like i really thought he was  like going to sit down with you  and be like  yeah no  he was not like that  whoa  no  he is excited  he is excited for sure  he is excited  like he does  he cares about you so deeply  right but i am not coming out  of this like not engaged  and i really like i am happy  that you guys did also get this  clarity too because it is  something i am obviously going to  have to talk to him about you  know  to not fully convince you both  that he is for me that is  like a very big worry for me  mm hmm  especially with the fact that  this whole journey has been  really hard  like now to have another thing  you know i know what your  expectation is out of this  and if his expectation is not  the same then we have  a problem  mm hmm  i do not know why  it is a conversation you are going  to have to have with him  i do not think this was going  to happen with aven at all  i am shocked  i mean me and aven talked at  length about being ready for an  engagement and being ready for  this next step and this is  what is happening in a couple  days  so why would you say one thing  to me and then say another thing  to my friends and family  like i appreciate your honesty  but why did you lie to me  oh that was amazing  just meeting all of them  like the conversation i had  with nate and sam  yeah how did that go  it went so well  i could just tell how much they  care about you and i can see why  you have them here  they asked some tough stuff  and i just tried to be as honest  and open with everyone about  you know where we are at and  where i am at and everything  so yeah did you like have  anything that you wanted to ask ',\n",
       " ' i still cannot believe that i am the bachelorette  rachel s the bachelorette  we get this amazing experience together  to truly find love  there is really no rule book for this  so we are just going with it  but i have absolutely no doubt  our future husbands are here  if you could kiss one of us which one would it be  both absolutely  good answer  i am having so much fun  getting to know the guys  so what do you think  yeah he is a piece of  oh  love is in the air  and i am so excited  to see where things go from here  i am so crazy about you  and i do not want a future without you  i am so happy right now  what is up gabby what is up rachel  what is up gabby what is up rachel  meatball will you accept this rose  i am sorry i cannot  i am here for gabby  meatball rejected my rose  like this is the most embarrassing thing in my life  no one s really ready to pick a lane and stay in it  having two bachelorettes has provided struggle  and i think it is all coming to a head  i do have my intentions solely for rachel  it is just like validating my fears  things have obviously taken a turn  what do you want to do  i need to tell her this full truth  you change your mind  why am i even doing this  life is so hard  i am so done  it is just so crazy  that this is like the way it ends  it is the most shocking season  of the bachelorette yet  and it starts right now  hi i am jesse palmer  and welcome to this extraordinary season  of the bachelorette  what makes it so extraordinary  well for the first time in bachelor history  we are going to have not one  but two bachelorettes  both looking for love  and both hoping for a romantic proposal  and let me just tell you it is going to be a wild ride  the way to the end  rachel recchia is a flight instructor  who is not afraid to put her heart on the line  gabby windey is an icu nurse with a sense of humor  that is had of america laughing  and personally i am so thrilled  that these two amazing women  will get a second chance to find love  right here on this show  so two women dating one group of men  how is that going to work  which woman gets to date which guy  who chooses  and then what happens if both women  fall in love with the same man  honestly i am not really sure  but i am confident that gabby and rachel can figure it out  the most important thing is that the women come in here  with a plan of their own  and then they support each other  on this unusual quest to find love  rachel and gabby are on their way here right now  but before they arrive let us take a quick look  at these two most deserving women  you deserve this  you deserve this no you do  oh my god  i am the bachelorette  one of two  insane  like am i being pranked  we are the bachelorette  oh my gosh together together  double the trouble double the  i just feel so lucky i feel so lucky  oh my god  gabby how is this happening  i am so thankful and so happy  because we are going to find love  hi  gals  i could not be more excited  just seeing my family  knowing that i have such support  is more than i feel like i could ever ask for  you are going to do fine sweetheart  i love you i love you too sweetheart  i cannot believe i get the opportunity  to find love  i am ready i am ready  this is crazy  me and gabby are the bachelorettes  yay we love you guys  we are both so deserving of love  especially after everything we went through  it was just really heartbreaking  clayton broke up with us together  because he was scared to let us go  when he knew it was over  i have never felt pain like this before  he told me he was falling in love with me  and he told rachel  what we went through with clayton  it was torture  and we were strung along   tonight on the bachelorette  bring it on  this is definitely not  the normal situation  because we do have two bachelorettes  do you think it is going to be two separate group dates  or are they both going to be on one  i cannot prepare for anything  how this is going to work with two bachelorettes  is one of the biggest things on everybody s mind  whoo  there is two bachelorettes  i want to start being able to figure out  which way am i leaning  what is up gabby what is up rachel  what is up gabby what is up rachel  it is complicated because you are dealing  with two amazing women  but they have polar opposite personalities  things will get messy i have no doubt about it  there has to be a point in this  where they are both going to like the same person  can i kiss you yeah  i do have to tell you something  what i kissed logan  what i am not interested in is you guys way  of going about this process  that is a form of control and that is manipulative  i feel really bad  he is like this incredible guy  but then something is off  i just do not know what to do  everything s just way harder than i expected  we have no idea what is going to happen  do you feel like it is appropriate to be  talking about fantasy suites this early  i do think it would be time for you to go  you came back  can we interrupt you guys  yeah you need to what is going on  we did ask you to leave  last night was crazy  i feel like we have so much time to make up for  we have guys  and we did not talk to more than half of them  i literally cannot believe it  i cannot believe we canceled the rose ceremony  we had to yeah  but i am looking forward to like having a group date  this week and really getting to know the people  that we have not spoken to yet yeah  but like what can we do like it is so rainy  i know i know  initially we were talking so much about a pool party  yeah which would have been nice  to like see their six pack abs yeah  like how do we get them to show us their six pack abs  yeah when it is raining  without being too obvious  we have to come up with some idea  last night  after the rose ceremony was canceled  of us moved into the mansion  there is not enough beds for all of us  i mean you cannot walk around this mansion  without stepping on someone  all right we are making breakfast  yeah i will make some eggs  i got you i got you we need bowls  got like a lot of oj or a little bit of oj  right there you hey watch your eyes  opa  i am trying to get a grasp  on how the rest of the week is going to go  i do not know if they are going to split it up  like half and half  is gabby going to take the guys that she is feeling  is rachel going to take the men she is feeling  how many one on ones  are there going to be any one on ones  so you think it is going to be two separate group dates  or are they both going to be on one  i hope they just give a one on one  to a guy that they have not even talked to yet  that would be phenomenal  i think that is going to be really tough  because there is so many guys  i mean we are here to hopefully  get an engagement at the end of the day you know  really fall in love with somebody  and how do you do that if you do not even speak with them  i have no idea what is going to happen  but that makes it fun  surprise  how is everyone how are you  today we have something  really special planned for the guys  of course last night did not really go as planned  we did not get to talk to half the guys  we saved a seat for you  oh my gosh thank you yeah  are you guys excited to be in the mansion  finally out of the hotel  we want a way for the men to go  one by one and show us their personality  and i think it will give us like a bigger picture  of who they are because we only got to see  you know three seconds of some of them  since there is so many of us we wanted to think of something  that we could get to know you guys kind of individually  so naturally we thought a pageant  would be the best way  a little talent show  a little talent a little interview  but before we get started  we have one last thing for you guys  really yeah  to help you along maybe  uh oh  your first gifts yeah  do not look  so you guys have minutes to prepare  and you guys better bring it  we will see you soon  oh mysterious i like it  hey what is in there what is in there  open it up so the girls  before they left dropped off some gifts  and i was thinking oh what s in the bags  you know what kind of gifts i love gifts  speedos what  little did i know it was going to be this type of gift  all right guys let us go get changed   tonight on the bachelorette  ahh  your smile melts my heart oh  it just feels like a really beautiful start  to something really amazing  i do just want to get on your lap  because i feel like i can get closer to you  right now i feel so loved and seen  we are in a football field right now  it was so special  i feel like i am going to remember this for the rest of my life  even if you were the only person here  i do not think i could have the heart to continue  i don t want a woman like you  it hurts to hear  like because there is two of us  they think they can act that way  i do not know if i have the capacity  to keep doing this like week after week  dude the girls just walked out  damn my brain is spinning right now  how many people left four left  i am leaving i am literally quitting  it all starts right now  we survived the night  yeah man  yeah it was pretty tight in that room  with that last rose  we have guys now  and i think we are definitely at a point  where people are starting to lean in directions  people are like i want to spend  more time with rachel  couple guys want to spend more time with gabby  and then there is a decent amount  they still want to explore both relationships  but my goal is just like spend more time with gabby  spend more time with gabby figure out how i can do that  wait who gave you your rose again  was it rachel or gabby  rachel but that do not mean nothing  i feel like i already know  something is there with me and gabby  but i do have to explore  rachel and i s connection first  before i can you know choose a lane here  did you guys talk to both ladies last night  or was it just one  i got to talk to both of them  i am not leaning towards one or the other right now  so just kind of like taking it day by day  okay  you know i am very interested  in both you know gabby and rachel  i have not quite made the decision  of which one i want to spend my time and energy with  so you know right now i am just happy to develop  those relationships with both of them  last night was really great  and i think already there is men  that are clearly here for rachel  and men who might be more interested in me  but there are a couple of men  more in the middle ground  that i think this week will help us figure out  who we should pursue relationships with  and who we are not meant to be with  hi  right now i am afraid of a couple things  i am afraid that i will kind of be let down  and i am afraid to make the wrong decision  obviously this is a fresh new week  yeah and we are going to be going  on dates this week mm hmm  but at what point do you think  we need to like figure out where everyone stands  because i feel like that would give me  so much more clarity yeah  and it would feel so much better moving forward  if i knew where the guys were at  yeah  i want these guys to be assertive  and make that decision fast  i feel like they have spent enough time with us  so i think now the one s that are lingering in the middle  it is kind of sketch  no i could not agree more  yeah it is disheartening for sure  mm hmm i do not know  maybe this week will help us figure it out  i feel like we somehow need to communicate that with them  i feel like we could just tell them  i mean it is our journey yeah  of course it is up to them as well  who they want to explore  but if at the end of the day mm hmm  we make a decision yeah  it is kind of up to them to reciprocate it  or decide not to continue i guess  yeah so true  i feel like this is going to be a big week for us  i could not agree more  and i think they do not realize really  how much is on the line this week  yeah  boys how we doing what is going on  jesse  what is up  all right well guys  well if you cannot tell by now  gabby and rachel they are not messing around  they are not looking for a fling  they are looking for their husbands  nate what was it like for you  getting to spend that entire day with gabby  you know it felt like a lifetime  i was fighting for a lot of time during the week  but to get that intimate time  i got to cover a lot of important topics  that i wanted to share with her  and i did come home with a rose  so i feel like our relationship  definitely progressed this week  so i am happy about that  that is fantastic  you guys want to talk about this week  yeah  it is a big one  there will be two incredibly romantic one on one dates  there is going to be one with rachel  there is going to be one with gabby  and there is going to be a rose on the line  at each of those dates  whoo wow  let us go  there is also going to be a massive group date  yeah  prepare for anything to happen this week  everything can change like that   tonight on the bachelorette  gabby and rachel  we are the bachelorettes  paris is romantic  there is something in the air  paris just does something to you  there is going to be two separate groups now  we are on two separate journeys  you bring sunshine  to rainy days in paris  i never thought i would be able to find someone  and like now it is right in front of my face  if you cannot find the romance here  take that long flight home baby  it feels like a fairy tale  and i wish i could just hang out here forever  rachel gave me a rose  but every time i am in  the same room as gabby and rachel  i realize my feelings toward gabby  he made a vulgar comparison  something about i don t trust these bitches  i have tried hard to put my feelings aside  but the heart wants what it wants  i want someone who is going to fight for me  every single day  is like a roller coaster  why does she look pissed off  do you know why i am talking to you right now  the shock on their faces  no one even knew what it was coming from  rachel was given some information  about some things said that was really disturbing  i hate every single day having to get to the point  of wanting to leave  i am just so over this  i am so done  so who here is with gabby  team gabby  okay who here is with rachel  jeez  and who is here for the right reasons  yeah who is here for the right reasons  the guys are split amongst two bachelorettes  going into the last rose ceremony  the girls picked their group of guys  so it is a lot easier for us to deduce  like where we stand in the house  i am team gabby all the way  i think that last night was pretty intense  that was a lot for me  i am still trying to digest that  yeah i feel lucky to still be here  rachel has given me a second shot  last night drama kind of ensued  rachel was upset  because three guys declined her rose  and then from my understanding  there was a an issue with hayden  i think he said some untoward things about gabby  i used the word rough around the edges  and what i meant by that was  oh  but i gave context behind it  it was not just like a single word  mm that is all right  that is kind of rough though bro  hayden s in the hot seat because of like  the last rose ceremony  he got a rose from rachel  but gabby brings up hurtful things have been said  maybe there is something he possibly could have said  a little bit differently  hey hayden  good luck dog  gabby s the one that used the word  rough around the edges  she said that  twice  oh really and i used that word  to describe her  and that is what they threw back in my face  mind if i slide in here yeah buddy  thanks  like i would hope that gabby  is a little bit more mature than that  i do not think i said anything wrong to be honest with you  my dumb ass uses the same verbiage  that gabby uses to describe herself  and she did not like that  well bitch maybe you should not use  that word to describe yourself then  oh my god  i am definitely seeing hayden  in a totally different light  you know he is saying things like  they overreacted both gabby and rachel  he called them bitches  it is disturbing and it is not how  you should treat or speak about women at all  yeah dude  and and that happened  and so like now i have been comparing right  i have been comparing my ex  to like like this right  they do not hold a candle to her  and i do not want to just settle  i can tell you right now i do not see  how any guy in here could be like  i m marrying these girls  hearing this from hayden is shocking  and that does not sit well with me  you know rachel gave me a second chance  and i want to be as honest with her as possible  if he is not totally invested in rachel  then he should go home  jesse  hey jesse  how we doing  what is up fellas  right well i hope you all got some sleep  you are going to need it  because today  a whole new part of this journey  is about to start for all of you  gabby and rachel have moved out of their mansion  and they have left los angeles  right now gabby and rachel are on an airplane  somewhere over the atlantic ocean  and they are heading to a country  that is world famous for romance  gabby and rachel are headed to france  ooh  yes all of you are going to be joining them there  yo  here is the thing  not all of you are headed there yet  and that is because two lucky gentlemen from this room  are going to be joining gabby and rachel  in one of the world s most famous cities   tonight on the bachelorette  we are going to get weird  do you like it  you impress me no you impress me  gabby s hands down  the coolest girlfriend i ever had  i love that i can just be myself around you  me too  every moment i spend with rachel  the connection is just there  i love that feeling of seeing you smile  my connections are so much stronger  than i ever thought possible  i will take any piece of you any day  i feel so happy  i care about rachel  but i cannot put my initial feelings  for gabby aside  this is humiliating  yeah humiliating  oh  there is logan coming in  that is just a huge wild card  is gabby questioning  her connections with the rest of us  that is like what is kind of going through my head  actions carry weight  and you cannot do something like that  it is going to because a stir  oh  oh whoa  i do not want to do this anymore  it all starts right now  waking up this morning i am so excited  we are sailing to another beautiful city in europe  bruges belgium  i am just excited to explore a new country  with my group of guys  i think ever since we started traveling  we have all been in really good spirits  and truly here to find love  thank you  i just hope that we keep kind of riding this high  we are very much in the middle of this journey  and i am developing  deep feelings for these men already  but as my connections get deeper  i never know who is going to surprise me  dude look how beautiful these towns look  i am so excited to be in belgium  i have never been and i am really excited to try  some real belgian chocolate  there are canals little alleyways  horse drawn carriages and it is just so romantic  it really is out of a fairy tale  moving into this week  i am excited for a fresh start  the past couple weeks have been really difficult for me  because i definitely feel like there is been  a lot of rejection  so i do want to put that behind me  i have a group date today  and i feel really confident in the guys that are here for me  they step up when i ask them to  i just only hope that this week  they can continue to show up for me  it was tough seeing rachel upset you know  over the past couple days  you know as a group we got to make her feel good  i think it comes down to all of us showing  how much we want to be here  there is not one guy around here that i do not think  is going to do that  this has been a hard couple weeks for rachel  and we all want her to smile and enjoy her time  and like i want those things for her too  date card  but that does not change what i feel  which is i feel for gabby  and i am just ping ponging this in my head constantly  tino  zach  meatball  ethan  tyler  logan  how sweet it is to be loved by you  love rachel  usually seeing your name on a date card  is instant gratification right  but this one s kind of mixed feelings for me  but yeah  it is nice to see your name on the date card  but you obviously kind of hope  that you were the one person not on the date card  but congrats to you aven  looks like you got the one on one  yeah that is exciting  for this whole journey i have gotten to know rachel  as this wonderful person  but the worst thing i could do is get to a point  where relationships are at a more serious level  and then bring this up  before this group date takes off  i need to talk to rachel  i need to tell her i cannot go and i need to tell her why  i have no clue how she will react  but maybe she will understand  i am praying she does   tonight on the bachelorette  i do not know if i am aroused or if i am just like scared  whoo we are in amsterdam  i know i cannot believe it  hi hey what is up  oh  when you feel so strongly about somebody  it is like you do want every second  you can with her and every memory you can make with her  it is crazy to say but  i am falling in love with you and  oh my gosh  hey sorry to pop up unannounced  i am really really sorry gabby  i know how important it was  i know how much you were looking forward to it  it is kind of a pit in my stomach  that i have to make this decision  you never like think in a million years  you are actually going to end up at hometowns  it is so real now  the fear is that i am falling really hard  for this girl and she is not  my heart is beating out of my chest  and that never has occurred to me until tonight  sometimes like love is like this  you want it to work so so bad  i cannot think clearly  for the past couple weeks  gabby and i have been traveling around europe  sailing on this ship for the chance at love  it is just so romantic  gabby s side my side we really have

sailing to amsterdam  and i am so excited to be here  have you ever been to amsterdam  no have you no i am so excited  it is so beautiful here  gabby and i are both feeling so hopeful about this week

hometowns are going to be so crazy  yeah  i am truly excited to spend time with the men here  in amsterdam but i know it is going to be another big big week  i look at these men  and i can see a future with each of them  whoever i give a rose to this week is going to hometowns  and it is a big step in a relationship  so i definitely want to think long and hard  and make a good decision  because i would never want to put someone through  me meeting their family if i did not see a future with them  oh my gosh we are in amsterdam  i know i cannot believe it it is so active  i have never seen so many boats  i know or bikes in one city  this is crazy cheers  oh cheers to you  to european adventures  they continue  i cannot believe we are here i know  we are going to hometowns it is

house alive  i almost cried  i feel bad not saying this to you earlier  i care about him so much and then i hear that  i feel like my heart is breaking   font color ff ff the bachelorette font font color ff season episode font  episode title font color ffc f week font aired on font color ffff august font  upbeat music   the past couple weeks  gabby and i have been traveling around europe  sailing on this ship  it was just truly the most romantic thing  i have ever experienced  and now we are going to be separating  and i could not be more excited for hometowns  i am going to be visiting zach  tyler  tino  and aven  this is the most excited i have been  on this journey definitely  i know how much family means  i am only visiting three men  jason  johnny  and erich  i am sure meeting their families  will bring out different sides of them  that i cannot wait to see  it should really strengthen my connection with each of them  what are you hoping to find out  as you meet all these families  i truly just cannot wait  to see where these guys have come from  and meet the people that are most important to them  meeting families is huge  because when you marry someone you marry their family  and if a family just does not like you  does not give you a chance  or you do not see yourself fitting in  it is definitely going to make you wonder  like how is this going to work in the future  how are you feeling i am nervous  meeting parents always scares the bleep out of me  it always has always will both laughing  should we get you off the ship  yeah america is calling  meeting the family is pressure on any relationship  these families know that i am still  actively dating other men  but i am hoping that they at least  keep their hearts and their minds open in meeting me  so i can make a decision if i am able to be engaged  by the end of this which i hope i am  i am so excited for my first hometown  and i get to spend it with jason  jazzy piano music  trolley bell rings   i am so excited  it is my first time in new orleans  vibes  ten out of ten  i always knew there was something special about jason  we both feel our emotions very deeply  which is why i am so attracted to him  but there is a large part of this process  that is making him uncomfortable  he is more reserved  i do not think it is a bad thing  laughing hi  because i do see a future with him  both laughing  honestly i am just excited to see different sides of him  and to meet the people who love him so much  how are you  so much better now that you are here  welcome to new

great dancer  new orleans it is a place  that i have just fallen in love with   tonight on a very special episode  of the bachelorette  i guess i like girls that are rough around the edges  all of your favorite men from the season are back  you had your chance  have some respect for the guys that were there  and they are ready to talk smack  you did mislead rachel throughout the whole process  were you hoping for gabby s rose  he was condescending calling them females  that was absurd let me speak let me speak  roby you were at the mansion for four hours for a reason  would you have kept me with blond hair  yes no just kidding  rachel the relationship did not really make sense to me  we had a connection and i think you did me wrong  you were still entertaining both sides  if you think you know what happens  meatball meatball meatball meatball  guess again  oh no  oh  it is a night full of surprises  this news is about to change your lives forever  are you ready to hear what i am about to say  so let us all raise our glasses  and toast to new adventures  and it all starts right now  good evening  thanks for coming  so great seeing you thank you  right  good evening bachelor nation it is so great being here  i am jesse palmer and welcome  to what promises to be a dramatic  and dare i say it shocking men tell all  that is right  now of course history was made  earlier this year when we introduced  not one but two bachelorettes  and so far this season really has lived up to all the hype  we have had double the drama double the tears  we have had double the romance and hopefully not one  but two engagements  so how is this all going to end  well later tonight you are going to get  a sneak peek that will definitely have  of bachelor nation in tears  so of course gabby and rachel are here  that is right  and so are all of your favorite guys  ready to hit the stage and tell all  we got so much to cover tonight  but first before the drama unfolds  we do have some unfinished business  that we have to get to  last week you saw all of the hometowns  you saw all of them except for one  rachel is now about to meet aven in salem massachusetts  and i am not going to give anything away  but here is a hint  it is cursed  i am being serious it is you do not believe me  take a look  today we are here in aven s hometown  salem massachusetts  and i am just nervous  because my last hometown with tino  did not go as i planned  it was really difficult  his family they do not like me  as much as he wants to tell me they do  and with tyler it was so tough  to break up with someone on a hometown  but i know that it was the right decision  aven is someone i have  an extremely strong connection with  hello hi  oh my god  i can absolutely see a future with him  you doing okay yeah  i am just really excited to spend the day with him  and to meet his family later tonight  i am a little bit more nervous for that  welcome to mass  salem has such a rich history  and i wanted to explore it together today  i am ready i am so happy  but i am so excited to see aven  i feel like today  i would fully expect his parents to be skeptical  my fears are that they just will not like me  they do not like this process they just do not trust it  so that is of course a fear for me tonight for sure  i am very excited for tonight but i will be completely honest  yeah i am really nervous  okay is there like a specific reason why  you told me last week that your parents both  did not approve of a couple of exes  how many  i have only had two serious relationships  and both of them they did not approve of  not both parents  i do not want you to go into tonight nervous  i want you to be excited because  i am excited too it is going to be fun  obviously like meeting the parents is nerve racking  regardless of the situation  but i definitely do not want you to go in there thinking like  oh they disapproved of his last two girlfriends  so what are they going to think  that is not how this is at all i promise you  okay i promise you  so when or ever was there a time  they both met someone at the same time  no there has not been okay  oh yeah you are the first one   previously on the bachelorette  welcome to new orleans  my family s going to love you  are they  meeting families is huge  if his family does not like me  like how is this going to work in the future  i just saw the chemistry and i said to myself  she could be the one  that is a scary thing to say itself  best case scenario they live happily ever after  i could never see myself getting engaged  like that is just not something i could see  myself doing at this point  i just have a hard time believing  a whirlwind fairy tale trip  is really going to prepare you for marriage  i feel like i could be the most perfect person  and they would not have liked me  i mean you are saying the right things  but i want to see him fall for the right person  i do not know how i made it out of that house alive  i almost cried  and tonight  whoo  we are here in mexico bienvenidos  and i am ready to fall in love this week  you good rach  i fully expect to be getting down on one knee  at the end of this  i am in love with you gabby  and i do not want to leave here without you  you are so sweet  i am just in shock that we are at this point  this is the moment during clayton s season  where everything went haywire everything went off the wall  it is really really hard to think about her  being on an overnight  it is gutting to even think about  i am like ready to be engaged  are you asking where i feel with that whole thing  yeah because we have a week left  no pressure  you know when you have crazy feelings for somebody  it is going to hurt to know that there are  other people still there  it is not my intention to have any sort of ultimatum  or anything like that but i cannot just like  go through this week being like everything s fine  i feel like we were able to have  like an honest conversation about it  so you brought me here to tell me it again  there she is  is that my two favorite things rachel and champagne  oh my god  hi  you look so beautiful you too  oh my god it is so good to see you in m xico  i know we are here i cannot believe it  we have so much to celebrate and talk about  oh my god i know  first of all cheers to you  you look so beautiful you do  and i am just in shock that we are at this point  me too because i feel like  this is the point when we were on clayton s season  where everything went haywire  like everything went off the wall  yeah you know this week is serious  it is overnights with multiple men  and being adult women and looking for engagement  like it is something that  where intimacy physical intimacy is something  you know that we need to like figure out  and see if we are compatible in that sense too  but as much as i want to revert back to like  let s play let s giggle  let us like chase each other around naked  well we could still do that but  yeah but i know i am going to have to like  flip it into but we do have to utilize this time  right to be honest like  i have been like dreading this week  yeah because of what happened  with clayton mm hmm  i have been so scared to be honest with them  because of how he made me feel in that moment  when he stood in front of us and he was like  not only am i intimate with both of you  i m love with all of you  i m in love with susie yeah  and just the general disregard  for everyone is feelings but his own  you know i thought the way that he told me he loved me  and the way that we were interacting  i m like it s me exactly  and that is when like  that is where my pain came from is  i almost felt like i was manipulated  yes  so i never want to make anyone else  feel the way that we did but that is kind of  where are you at with your guys  with tino i feel like he was the first one  that i knew had really strong feelings for  yeah it is never changed  it is really only gotten better  there is so many things about tino  that i can see myself being with forever  but i do obviously have to talk about  what happened with his hometown  yeah  because his family were not accepting of me  yeah and i do not know if it is  they are just against the fact  that this is so not traditional  and that is maybe what they wanted for him  and this just is not that  but i mean tino is an adult he is making his own decisions  and he finally told me he is falling in love with me  which was so important to me i was freaking out  like i did not know how i would get through this week  if he did not tell me  yeah  and he did tell me  so i am really happy that he did that  but i just really i think ultimately want clarity   previously on the bachelorette  my heart s a little bit in my throat saying this  but i love you rachel  it was love in paradise  do not forget i am falling in love with you  i am in love with you too  whoo  until it was not  so is this our goodbye  i think so  as much as like i do not want to say goodbye to johnny  i know there is something waiting for me  that is really great  right now it is hard for me to like get  to the point of engagement  i am not like a super jealous person  but i am like picturing a girl that like  i am in love with doing that with somebody else  like that kind of crushes me  so you brought me here to tell me it again  no no  and tonight  i am scared that i could leave here alone  erich up last night  i felt like i was being almost pressured  into a decision  ah  but with jason i never have to defend myself  to feel this strongly about somebody  and know that you can lose that person  that is a horrible feeling  zach is everything that i want in a partner  we did have a big night  proposal is right around this corner  for sure  i am having a lot of anxiety  after fantasy suite everything took a  i felt blindsided  that was the last thing you could have ever expected  tonight like i want to be fully honest and transparent  gabby will not be joining you  you are the only bachelorette here  is it me  what is it about me that is so hard to love  i am scared  you know i am feeling really nervous  gabby walked away and that could be the end of it  i you know brought up something  that we had talked about  in confidence and in privacy  at this point there are other people involved  and she still has more you know fantasy suite dates  you know i kind of lost trust in us and her  it got really in my head and i wish i did not  i up  you okay yeah  i just sometimes need a second  and i do not like want to be upset like wrongfully  so i think because we had talked about it multiple times  just us two i did not know if you truly  did want me to say something  no no  listen the reality is i am in love with you  and i am terrified of losing you  so i up an opportunity and this was just  supposed to be like positive and just us  like to sneak in a moment  yeah  because i am scared  i think your heart is in the right place  but i do not  i have like worked my ass off  for there to be like no question  on making good decisions  it came from a moment of insecurity  and like these unjustified doubts  and then i am like what the is going on  like  but every time i see you it is like all right  yeah  i am sorry i do not want to see you sad  no it is okay  i up a it could have been  a good moment and i am really sorry  i just do not want to lose you at this point   tonight  the shocking drama begins  live  i do not want to do this  anymore  gabby  i want to leave here  get ready for the dramatic  season finale of  the bachelorette  four men  i want to be with rachel at  the end of this  like i want to have a life with  her  two women  we are literally about to be  engaged  i feel like all my dreams  are like coming true  and one dramatic final day  you should not have had to go  through that and it is really  not okay  this is my daughter  nobody s going to take her away  from me without a fight  how will it all end  i have always been honest with  you  why zach  oh my god  tears of joy  i just love her  i want the best for her  or tears of utter heartbreak  i feel so blindsided by you  what am i supposed to do  walk away because he is not ready  to propose  and just when you think it is  over  you are lying straight to my  face  look me in the eyes and lie to  me again  the crazy drama continues  i want an answer for why you  did what you did  i am sorry  this is actually crazy  the television event of the  summer is finally

cute cute cute  good i know  good limo yeah  i hope rachel s not into him  because i want to get to know him  but you know there is so many men  there is two of us and it is clear that  we are going to be attracted to the same guys  i honestly feel like the luckiest guy  in the world right now standing in front of you two  and i can confidently say two is definitely better than one  yeah of course  i mean it is going to get pretty tricky  and i think there is going to be hardship  with dating the same pool of men  you know this is history in the making two bachelorettes  like how is this going to work you know what i am saying  if two of them ultimately end up being into like one  that is going to be like a real interesting scenario  this morning i woke up  i opened my eyes and  oh  i see you rachel  and you gabby  nice yeah it is pretty good  but now that i have met you guys  i will say the real thing is much better  this is crazy  i have no idea how this is going to work  it worries me a little bit  because i definitely feel like gabby and i  could fall for the same guys  i am a professional race car driver  oh wow  so you could say that i am used to  some wild and crazy rides  i mean we only have so many guys here we can date  we are going to obviously both like a couple of them  do either of you guys know how to tie a tie  please help me oh i can maybe  give it your best shot should i try  i really hope that does not happen  but of course i want to remain open  oh perfect yeah  just fold it down fold it back up  rachel please help  well i look pretty good  at the end of the day it is an individual journey  we both are here to find our own individual husbands   hopefully  all right rachel gabby  you have now met all men  i mean that is a lot of guys to meet in one night  it is a lot but we have each other  right we are willing  to take on the challenge divide and conquer  yeah  it is a lot of guys though  for real a lot of people here  the more competition the better right  the guys are all here and it is crowded  and hot in here that is for sure  you guys have a strategy  how you are going to divide and conquer  yeah hopefully we can just  figure it out on the way  see where the night takes us  this is going to be wild  there is two girls  there is two  i cannot even anticipate what is going to happen  i do not know how these two bachelorettes  how this is going to go  there is a lot of questions that is going to happen  down the line for all of us yeah  there is no precedent for this  there is no basis for this at all  having the two bachelorettes is legendary  it is also going to create some drama for sure  naturally as men we are territorial  but we got two bachelorettes  it is a different ball game  it is definitely going to be double the fun  you know double the action  double the chances to find love i feel like  so you got to make it known that you are a contender  and guess what you are talking to mario  hey we ready for whatever  we ready for whatever  to history in the making here  we got gabby and rachel  bachelorette season let us do it gentlemen  whoo  cheers let us go  my heart has been pounding nonstop  ever

no idea how this is going to work  how does the first impression rose work  what if we want to give it to the same person  there is so many questions moving forward  who are you guys going to talk to first gabby or rachel  i just want a chance to showcase who i am  to one or both of them honestly on the first night  you cannot go wrong with either one of them  finally whoo  wow you guys look incredible  thank you so much of course  oh thank you you are welcome  that is that southern hospitality there  all right oh my gosh well  we are both so excited to be here  yeah we know what it is like being in your guys shoes  we were just there not that long ago  i think i was standing right back there  and we just want to say thank you so much  we know like how much of a sacrifice  it is to be here  there is so much unknown  but the more you lean in truly  the more you do get out  so i hope you guys can trust us along the way  gabby and i we are both really confident  that if you guys are open and vulnerable  and give us all good communication  that love is here  yeah as i do not know if you guys know  but this is the most men we have ever had here  we noticed  we noticed for sure  the testosterone is flowing  it feels good  yeah  but we are breaking new ground  with two bachelorettes and with all of you guys  so i hope we are patient with each other  yeah we just look forward to this journey  it is going to be a wild ride  i am ready let us do it  should we cheers yes  cheers cheers  cheers  we will get better at that  we will get better at the cheers  yeah it is a lot at once  i honestly have no clue  how the night s going to work having two of us  i kind of just have no expectations right now  i just want to have a good time  almost like get my feet wet  in the sense that i am dating like multiple guys  do you all want to see a couple of magic tricks  would love all right  do you guys remember my name  roby  how do you remember it  because magic  here grab one oh do it okay  i will keep going got it  look at it both of you  ooh  good good good say stop at any moment  stop  put your card down right over here  so i just rub down the pants and i get a bit of color   from the pants  into the pack like so  oh god oh yes  now that color could have gone anywhere  it went to that seven of hearts yes  oh  the magician he pulled a houdini  i feel like honestly like  yeah you can give them like tricks and stuff like that  but at the end of the day how long is that going to work  i do not want it to be the roby show  i want it to be the rachel  this is the rachel and gabby show  how is it like being on the other side  of the table right now  it is refreshing yeah  yeah yeah it is crazy  it is like you are in the position of power  you have the authority you have the control  you know you can say that no  yeah yeah yeah absolutely  how are you feeling  i am so nervous it is frenetic  that is normal yeah  we have been there yeah  yeah definitely normal  what was the scariest moment for you  um all of it  all of it i mean  where are they i want to find them  that is what i am saying yeah we have to  she is still over there no  are you going to sneak in there and steal some time  you have got to be sneaky  just a little bit but do you want to step  on people s toes i do not know because  not on your toes for sure  you are at the most you are most vulnerable  might have to be aggressive to really get that time  and actually make a i guess like an impression  double the trouble  we love it  we wanted to meet you guys together  because obviously we are twins  but we want you to see the differences between us  because our personalities i feel like  we are very different  for me for instance i feel like  i am a little bit more of a laid back  reserved kind of person a little bit outgoing  he is more of a bold  out there type person bold  okay yeah  so that is how we kind of differentiate  between each other and who we attract  who we do not attract like so that is how we  yeah okay  yeah so definitely  how does it feel coming in together  you guys definitely make us feel calm though  i could tell that energy that yeah exactly  you bring such positive energy  so you guys that is so nice  yeah yeah you are so okay  you guys said you have your differences  yes so what is  the differences besides personality wise  hobbies  no honestly not a lot or same hobbies  everything so we are all the same  yeah went to the same school  oh so you guys never separate  well we did not live together throughout school  we did like a couple of years and then we like  separated because we wanted to do  our own thing and be individual  absolutely we had to you know  yeah kind of like job wise  we do the same job yeah what is job  so we are medical advertising s what we do  but both separate companies though  so like that is the only difference  the conversations with the twins  and rachel and i  is just are not working for me  kind of romantically  i feel like i cannot like build a very strong bond  with either of the twins  yeah it is just like  i do not know  it are not doing it for me  do you feel like you guys can read each other s minds  like across campus in college  i could spot him from miles away  oh wow stuff like that  do you guys experience any of that  you know being together  we were not in the womb together so  i think it is much different  we can read each other s minds  yeah never know  there is me there is gabby there is both the twins  i do not know if they are trying to get us to go  on double dates planning for the future  but definitely hard to form a connection  when there is multiple people sitting here  i am not into it  the one thing i want to get across is  i am here for something real  okay me too awesome  and i want to be here i want to be super open  and whenever i found out both of you were the bachelorettes  yeah what were your thoughts on that  were you nervous it was a little scary  exactly i was a little nervous  like i came into this  i kind of showed you guys  i wanted to like separate you two  that is how i did the earphone thing  and we definitely noticed that as well  so i wanted to like show you that  like i had the florida vibe with you  and then i did not want you to hear what i said to her  i heard  but no i appreciate that because it really does mean  a lot for you know someone to come in and give us both  individually like our own attention  you two are very different  but i understand you are like on the same journey  but you have your own separate journeys  so like i wanted to come in and be  able to show you that like i recognize you  i recognize her in different ways  yeah and like that is  kind of how i came up with what i did  it is perfect yeah  tonight at the beginning it was a little awkward  just because me and gabby really  do not want it to be a competition  of course gabby and i are in this journey together  but little moments like that where the men are able  to make me feel like i am the only girl there  it is important i think for gabby and i  both to feel different  all right so if i am going to ever  bring you home to boston  to meet my friends and family  you are going to stick out like a sore thumb  oh why okay unless  unless we teach you the lingo  oh god i know you know english  but this is different  barely all right  so i am going to be a teacher oh  how did i miss that whiteboard  if you are walking down the street  and you want to say hi to someone  uh huh  you write like a five year old  no that is pretty good hello good  will you chill  can you let me finish  hello good sir how  you don t say good sir  so we are being very proper is boston in like the s   if you wanted to say this super proper  people say that with a straight face  gabby gabby zhh zhh no they do not  okay okay gabber gabber  look at me look at me shh  okay i am done  we are going to say it in boston  uh huh this is what we do  ryan is really fun i feel like  we have great energy right off the bat  hey guy how are you  i could do that beautiful  he is super easy to talk to  we can just kind of like give each other a little  and just like overall enjoy his company  do i have a booger  no do you no  you have something  no do i have one  oh my no stop  gab gab you got to go do i  cut cut no i am just kidding  you do not have anything you have nothing nothing  knowing that ryan is already so invested  is such a good feeling  i was so pumped to meet you  because you are absolutely hysterical  oh my gosh thank you  i cannot wait to see what the rest of the night brings  i cannot pick who i like more  you know i am really excited  to just get one on one time with both  get a fair shot with both and just see  who i have a better connection with  i think that is important  they both have different qualities that are amazing  so it is possible that you could  fall for both and not even know it  until you like wake up one day and like  man what do i choose especially there is two  what do i choose yeah  oof  we will warm you up out here  yeah we need a blanket or something  the night started off a little bit awkward  but since we have been able to separate  getting to talk to these guys individually is almost  like meeting them again for the first time  i went to ucf  no way  and so i live in tampa now though  my brother lives in tampa  i am really hopeful that i am going to start  making more romantic connections  with these guys because that is why i am here  and that is what i am looking for  i know that a couple of weeks ago  it was your birthday  it was okay  so i had plenty of time to do this  oh my goodness  oh my  i had plenty of time can i read it  yes i would love for you to read it  happy birthday rachel  i know your birthday was a few weeks ago  but it s never too late for best wishes  i hope your life is filled with an abundance  of love joy and most of all me  love your co pilot hayden  oh my gosh i love it  this is so special  oh my goodness well that came from heart  hayden is so cute  he really went out of his way to let me know  that he is interested in being here for me  and that makes me feel so special  i definitely feel a spark with hayden  i have had this for a long time basically  it is just a list of like attributes  that about a future wife aww  i am not sure if you have one of these  it is kind of cringy but then i am like all right  no that is okay no i appreciate the effort  i feel like it is important to think about these things  for sure especially going into something like this where  oh my gosh you know you do not really  know what you are going into  well i do not know at the same time  like are we going to be good together  totally is there things  that are going to you know branch out for us  like this is not just a first date  it is like almost like a first everything  so i will kind of go over these right right  so the first attribute of a future partner is  is open and honest with her feelings  they are intentional in everything that they do  takes care of herself physically  so hopefully you take care  i mean  shirtless jacob his pecs are rock hard  lives a very passionate life  i cannot stop looking at them  yeah and then has a good sense of humor  so obviously i think we are good on that part maybe  yeah  he is great  he came to our conversation  very intentional  which is nice but he was way more shy than i thought  i thought they were going to be kissing  over the place but they have not  i guess is not afraid of physical touch  yeah so i mean  i am terrified no  yeah yeah of course yeah  i think physical chemistry means  so much especially when you are dating  in order to like keep the attraction  so i feel like kissing is really important  like you think anyone s kissed them yet  i would kiss both of them but i do not know how that would work  yeah before i kiss one of them  i got to figure out which one i like  because i am not going to play i am not going to play with them  it is a delicate process where you cannot  come on too strong but you have to be a little bit  selfish and just be you to figure out like  is there that instant chemistry  you know one thing i definitely wanted  to let you know up front is you know what you said  inside about kind of opening up and vulnerability  it is very important to me  it is very important yeah i know  but it is like it is always been kind of tough  for me to do that early on okay  but i want you to know that you know i am here for you  yeah and i am willing  to kind of meet you there  and it might take me a little bit  longer than some of the other people  we will work on it we will try  but you know i am going to give it my absolute  best when it comes to that  i really liked aven right off the bat  kind of wearing your heart on your sleeve   even when it is scary i know  he definitely was inching a little bit closer to me  i am just i am like oh my gosh  i really really hope this experience is  so much better for the both of you  yeah  that must have been a lot  but there was no kiss  it was so great to talk to you  maybe it just was not the right moment  maybe he was nervous  i am not sure what is going on with him  but i at least for me  thought it was a good conversation  so i understand that you are a pilot  i am right and that is super cool  so me being a race car driver  i might have brought my actual race car  oh my goodness to show you  whoa  this is what is called a top fuel dragster  oh my goodness  so this is the car that i drive  so you sit right in here  oh my god  so that is where i sit whoa  here is my controls in here so  okay  so these two levers right here  are the parachutes so i go  wait so you go like really fast  and then the parachutes go out the back  i have gone miles an hour are you serious  this thing goes miles an hour  oh my goodness  it is pretty big though is not it  with you being a pilot and all you know you spent hours  and hours learning how to fly a plane you know  learning the controls that sort of thing  so you know i kind of did the same thing  and so when you drive one of these things  you have to learn what the controls are  those kind of things  so hopefully one day you can show me  how to fly a plane and one day i can  show you how to drive this thing  absolutely  jordan v really surprised me  i enjoyed our conversation and i feel like  in a way we do have a lot in common  wow i am very impressed by you  i am impressed by you  oh thank you  i came here for you so  oh for me really  yes  i do not know if you are familiar with horsepower  but it makes horsepower so  oh my goodness wow  i was a little bit surprised that jordan did not kiss me  i thought the moment was right  but i mean  it is only night one but  clayton kissed me on night one  i noticed when you guys were in there  one of the things you said you were like  just to kind of be more open and honest  right now like to be vulnerable  and that is like a part of the journey  and then you guys were like cheers up to that right  and i was like oh okay yeah do it now  but like what does that like look like for you  considering you know clayton was like i love you  right right and then you fell through  how has your lens changed in that area  for me it took me i definitely got there  but it took me a little bit of time  to be more vulnerable  and kind of share my story  and have faith in myself  and the relationship that i was building  yeah i think it is so important  to just like trust your gut  and know what you have to offer  absolutely i just want you to know  i am coming to you with a open heart  i think naturally as like a man  you know i think in our culture today like  there is this stigma that like men are just closed off  like you know they have walls up  but i am willing to be vulnerable  yeah and to just be  present minded with you you know what i am saying  totally and that is a good sentiment  just not like going through the motions  you know what i am saying right  it s like all right hey you take care  you know what i am saying  you just hit my reflex in my knee  wow did like your leg just kick off  also i am a doctor  but no i am just saying like  i do look for that connecting point  yeah i appreciate that  no problem yeah  yeah but you look very beautiful though  oh thank you you as well  thank you yeah  i was just  you know i am glad you did okay  i was like i just really want to kiss you so  yeah aww i appreciate that  yeah no but i look forward to connecting more with you  i know me too  over the course of several weeks  yeah yeah thank you  i was really excited to talk to mario  he is a great kisser  he is kind of giving me butterflies  these first few guys are really amazing  it is truly surreal to know that they are here for me  i am enjoying the hell out of it  but i want to know who rachel is kissing  if they are good if they are bad  i feel like it is not weird  i mean she is my friend  we are going to sit right here  yeah so i figured you know you might have a little bit  of a troubled past with the stairs  so maybe we could no  maybe we could get together  and make a better memory out of it  not the stairs  ah you know we could tackle it and  you know maybe you will remember the stairs really fondly now  i am really excited about tino  he brings me to the stairs  which i had a little bit  of a time on the stairs on my season with clayton  and he tells me he wants to make the stairs  you know a little bit better   mm hmm  and yeah family is super important to me  not only that i mean  and that taught me a lot of life lessons like  things are not always going to go as planned  and that is okay  and you just have to pick up the pieces and become stronger  so that is just a little more insight into why i am  the way i am  yeah yeah  jordan he is so perfect  he is exactly what i have asked for  and he is here for me  he is being honest  but the more the day is progressing  the more i just know that there is something missing  and the more i feel it the more i am pushing it down  yeah well this truly means  so much to me that you were able  to feel comfortable enough to share all of this with me  well thank you i appreciate that  okay sorry just a minute  you are good you are good you are good  i feel really bad  i am just trying to i do not know  it is hard because i do not know  and i want to know i do not about him  kind of curious he is been gone all day  his bags are still here  i guess there is a connection between him and rachel  someone is here let me get the door  i cannot go wrong with either lady  i definitely want one on one time with one of these girls  like i want to to take every opportunity and try  to make these girls laugh try and make them smile  try to really just stand out from the pack  hey boys we got a date card  the hard part for me is you know  i want a date card that every other guy wants  nate meet me at my place  love gabby ps bring a bathing suit  good job good job  it literally feels like i just won the lottery  let us go let us go  you better smile  you better be smiling dawg  no like i am so shocked  i am happy for sure you better be happy  yeah i am happy but i am like no  i am like i am legit shocked  like i literally thought my name was like  the last name that was going to be called  but like i am genuinely happy like  i feel like i could run through a wall right now  whew get to be gabby s first date  i just cannot believe it this is crazy  how are you feeling  i feel really bad about him  i guess i am just confused  that is okay  sorry about that it is okay it is okay  everything okay  yeah okay  okay  um  i truly could not have asked for a better person  to spend this incredible day with  but  there is just something that is missing for me tonight  and for that reason i do not want  to bring you into next week knowing that i do not know   if i can truly get there with you  and i just really want to be honest  and for that i am sorry  but for that reason i cannot give you  this rose and i do truly apologize  because you are absolutely incredible  i cannot tell you enough  i able to walk you out yeah absolutely  i am so sorry  it is okay it is okay it is okay  i understand it is  i feel horrible  and i also feel guilty because this is my first one on one  as the bachelorette and i want it  to be so perfect and it is such an amazing night  but there is something i cannot shake  one last hug of course  thank you i it is okay  i appreciate everything okay  and i had such an incredible day planned out  for my first one on one ending the night  with a private concert from ashley cooke and brett young  but it just was not meant to be  i feel a lot of pressure as the bachelorette  if this first one on one is not working  that i am failing in the role  it is hard because i really want to be  the best bachelorette for these guys too  and i just do not want them to feel like  i am failing them either  oh  yo what are they doing  he is holding his bag up they grabbed his bags  i did not ever expect to be bachelorette  and so it is just hard to like  really feel like i deserve it  because i never feel like i did  i do not want to be rachel the bachelorette  i just want to be rachel  how was your night  how like how are you feeling this morning  last night i just kind of realized  like i just do not see jordan as my future husband  and i think it is so hard to like  be really honest with yourself especially when jordan  was someone i was so excited about  yeah and i mean he is great  it is just so confusing  i am actually really scared like  i do not know right  i mean even with nate i am like  super attracted to him  i think he is really fun but i am like  what if the same thing happens to me  you know that you are attracted to nate  and you want to see where it goes  trust yourself and be honest  yeah  that is good advice  i just really hope that these guys know we are like  taking it seriously  because i am sure they were all shocked too  yeah that is what i was thinking of too  i m like damn i bet they know we mean business  yeah  i was so sure that jordan was going to come back  no like we all looked over and like  next thing we know his bags are gone  so it is just like  it was just a trip that like it happened that quick  we will see what happens today with nate  yeah  jordan v got sent home  i did not

know i  i think the favorite part is everything you know  cheers cheers  yeah it is my first date  to you to you  to us yeah  watching gabby and nate you can tell  that there is a connection and a spark  and it is not forced at all  even just the way she looks at him  it is just completely different than how i felt  yesterday with jordan  of course i would have liked mine to go  that way as well but it is good to see that gabby s happy  thank you for coming today  oh no thank you for inviting me  like my my heart dropped whenever they said my name  i kind of blacked out for a minute  did you  i just really wanted to make an impression  because i feel like i do care about you  and a lot of who you are resonates with me  oh my god my first kiss with gabby  it was magical  like her lips are so soft  i i knew she was a good kisser but damn  there is our ride  stop it yeah  helicopter came out of the sky and my jaw just drops  i am like this is so cool  oh thank you  oh this is so cool  this is the best day ever  oh god  it is so beautiful  oh this is amazing  holy  son of a gun  bye all right bye guys  is he waving at us  i am sorry but not sorry  yeah  that was not fun to watch  they are rubbin it in our face  only we are having a good time  yeah  this is cool yeah  how are you with roller coasters  i do roller coasters just fine  except for being afraid  except for being terrified  yeah but like would rather be  on a roller coaster than like skydiving  oh ten times out of ten  whoa whoa  oh man whoa  he was doing backflips and we were like ahh  in the helicopter it seems like i can see  the entire world but i found myself looking  inside the cabin at the hottie to right most of the time  oh oh  oh this is awesome  it really is  flying on the helicopter with nate was really romantic  i really feel like i am on a first date  with the guy i am super into  this is easily the best date ever  yeah  oh oh wait are we oh are we stopping  oh we are landing on something  what  oh my gosh this is awesome  this is our hot tub  oh my gosh this looks so cool  oh we got champagne there too look how cute it is  yeah look at this  i will step down it is the perfect size  oh thank you  did you bring your speedo  gabby looks so good today  i can easily say like i have  i have never had the chemistry you know  kick off so well so early  her smile is so radiant and her personality  just makes it shine even more  how old are you  you seem so mature  i am i have never met a mature man  i have never met a mature woman  i love your voices i do them all the time too   it is cool but no i could just  it is one of those things like i could sense  that you are very mature  i know that you know you are funny and goofy  but there is a deeper side to you  that is serious  when you need to be yeah  you just make me feel good around you  and i just want to be like around you more  for a first date to be this good  like it is kind of setting the bar  i just kind of just want to keep getting to know her  because there is so many levels  to her that it is just beautiful  this has been really good  she just has a way of bringing out the best in me  and i just like who i am around her  and i think there is something there  so hopefully tonight ends with me  getting to continue this journey  nate has been gone a long time  i feel like so far this date s  a little bit longer than maybe jordan s yesterday  i thought there was about a chance  jordan came back and he did not  it was definitely shocking that he  did not walk through that door  absolutely  i mean and then now we have nate  on his first one on one with gabby  so it is  what could happen there and that is the thing too  i i in my head just thinking to myself  those bags could honestly leave too  i do not i guess we will uh we will see  we will see  thank you  i think today has really showed me that  nate has great character  he is so easy and fun to be around  i do not think i have ever dated someone quite like him  that is sweet thank you  i know there is a lot more to him  and i am just getting the beginning  it is just been so fun to really like  peel back the layers and get to know him  i am so glad that you came today  it was just fun it felt like i genuinely  hung out with someone that i have known  for longer than you know three days  yeah totally  you know like such a familiar soul  and i think it is because we are similar in a lot of ways  and i know we still have a lot  to get to know about each other  but i like how this is starting  i really do yeah  i think immediately i felt something  yeah yeah intrigue a connection  it was it was funny whenever you were like  we are just going to chill in the house because you know  it could have been that or the most extravagant of dates  like granted i loved it yeah totally  yeah  i prefer the helicopter yeah  i prefer the helicopter  yeah  oh my god  oh my goodness  no but there is one thing that i do want to  to tell you about so the biggest part of me  that i really have not discussed  thus far is i am a father  and i have a beautiful baby girl who is six  aww and she is she is my world  like a pocket of my heart just just burst open  the first time you know she said dad  or the first time she told me she loved me the first time  like i felt her her hug me like it is  it is just i am i am a girl dad  you are going to make me cry  so sweet oh thank you  please do not make me cry oh my gosh  what is she like  she is she is like the human form of coffee  she is um i do not know  she is like a little me for the most part  aww i love her a lot  yeah no that is so sweet  i am actually really close with my dad  really and he just because  i think he is always wanted to be a dad too  mm hmm  and i feel like sometimes you know  with parents and stuff  you feel like you have a calling  it was definitely his to be a dad and he always  like had a huge presence in my life so  that is amazing  i am not really close with my mom  i think that is a lot of the reason why i am  who i am today mm hmm  but i had to be really self sufficient  and independent and relearn what it was to be loved  because i did not totally get it as a child  so for you to like step up and want to give that  to your daughter is amazing and it is the best thing  that is ever going to happen to her  when nate told me that he was a father  i started to think am i there yet  can i be a mother  is this a life i want  but i do not have to make that decision  right now and i feel like it does  bring me closer to him just knowing that he  feels comfortable telling me all of these things  i really do see like  that i can have a potential future with you  and a potential for love  meeting you has been one  of the greatest days and moments you know  that i could have aww  that i could have gone through  so i appreciate you oh my gosh thank you  i genuinely appreciate who you are as a person  yeah  i just want to say   i did not know what to expect  you know bringing you here  i had a really good feeling  listening to you speak about your daughter  watching you be able to give this unconditional love  that is going to go with her forever is like really  the best thing i could ask for in a partner  nate  will you accept this rose  absolutely  perfect just perfect  giving nate my first one on one date rose  it feels so good to be able to let him know  that i appreciate him  hearing his story about his daughter  i know if i were to ever become a mother like it would  it would be like so hard i think  because i feel like you would just love it so much  i think i have been afraid to be a mom  sometimes because i think it would hurt too bad  and we spin oh can you dance actually  and then you are yeah aw  he gives me the confidence to not be so scared  some people have the ability to love greater  or maybe feel things more  and i can just see him having such a big capacity for love  it is easy to see my life with him  he really is like a true true man  i feel like tonight you know  the tensions going to be high yeah  a lot of people are going to want time  and we will just see how it goes  i do not know it is going to be interesting  if you had a choice who would you  want to talk to first  i am not leaning towards one or the other  so you know we will see what happens i do not know  yeah  really waking up this morning is  is there is a lot on my mind  tonight s the cocktail party  you know we started the week off really really good  until jordan had his one on one date  with rachel and he are not come back  you know so it left some questions in the air  for me i am just you know really trying to understand  how this whole ceremony can work tonight  that is really going to be a big game changer  i am a little scared i will be honest i am a little scared  the way that this rose ceremony is going to work  with two bachelorettes is one of the biggest things  on everybody s mind in the house  we are not sure if each gabby and rachel are going to  hand out a certain amount of roses  if they are collectively  going to give one rose to one person  decisions are going to be made tough decisions  but it is up to gabby and rachel and whatever they decide to do  hello you two hi jesse  how is it going good how are you  you both look fantastic thank you  so fill me in tell me about the week  how did it go  it was pretty crazy it was  we each had a one on one yes  so we had different experiences  mm hmm which is i feel like  going to be normal moving forward yeah  how hard was it to juggle those men together  it makes it easier to have her with me honestly  we bounce ideas off each other and kind of check in  with one another throughout the night and day  so how do you decide who is more into  that part to me seems like it would be  really really confusing  i think it is a little  too early yeah  i think there will be a natural time  when it splits off mm hmm  mm hmm but it is still so early  all right  because you canceled the first rose ceremony  there are guys in there  as always i am here for you  if you need anything the night is yours  go on in have fun and good luck  ah  let us do it see you guys  thanks jesse  i am very excited to go into  the cocktail party tonight  but i definitely had a more rocky start to the week  i definitely thought at this point i would have more guys  i was extremely ready to further a connection with  and right now i am at square one with a lot of them  what if they do not like me  if these guys do not step it up for me  maybe i am going to get to the point where  it just does not work out  i think i mean i think the most exciting part  about tonight is we are finally going to get  some clarity and validation  like that is really when this journey starts  thank you  we just wanted to welcome you guys tonight  thank you so much for an incredible week  as you guys know i sent jordan home  during our one on one this week  which was not an easy decision for me  but i want to use this as a lesson to everyone   that one conversation can truly change everything  i am actually really proud of rachel  we are going to have to make these hard decisions  it might seem like we have a lot of time now but things  do move pretty fast around here and we want to be  able to foster the connections that we do feel like we have  absolutely so cheers to a great night  yay cheers  you know guys are starting to name drop  and be like oh i m team gabby i m team rachel  you know i got a chance to connect with gabby and was  fortunate enough to get the first impression rose  i do not want to neglect the significance of that  but at the same time if there was any time  to get to know you know rachel it is now  what is up gabby what is up rachel  what is up gabby what is up rachel  i appreciate your time  yes absolutely  we honestly have not had a chance to connect  i was going to say i was looking forward to it  i was excited about the chicago vibe  so i was just like cups  i met gabby i was like let me talk to rachel  i am glad no i am glad you pulled me  so as a career you know  i am a personal trainer and so i want  to take you through a mini workout  yes please where you are not  going to be doing much okay  but i am going to be supporting you  okay because a part of being  together is supporting each other  okay so follow me are we going to go  yeah we are going to come right here  okay i am ready  i definitely was interested  in mario night one  but i am thinking about gabby  because he is her first impression rose  it is a big deal  i just want you to stand right here okay  i want you to face this way  okay keep turning keep turning keep turning  okay i want you to be right here  and i am going to pick you up  beautiful and we are going to do  we are going to move forward here  all right and i am going to do three squats with you  okay you ready here we go  when i saw nate on the helicopter last  yeah yeah yesterday when i saw nate  on the helicopter yesterday with you i was like  uh huh oh man dude that s fun  you are good three  oh i am positive hey how is your day going  my name is mario oh my gosh get up  three beautiful okay  i do think that i could feel something for mario  like he is very attractive and passionate  and he picked me up and i was sweating a little  if the rest of the guys continue to bring it  tonight might look pretty good  for my job i own a seasonal business on a boardwalk  the jersey shore boardwalk  yeah exactly is that where you work  yes my brother no way  my brother and i own a bunch of the basketball games  up there so we got seconds mm  whenever you are ready oh it started up  oh i only have one  i only have one  how many do you have  i was about to block you too no way  no the bulls are not very good  what did you just i do not know what to say  all right well i won at the end of the day  so i think i get a kiss  after my one on one with jordan  it was extremely disheartening but then tonight  i am like so pleasantly surprised  like oh my gosh i feel like really good again  i hope that gabby s having as much fun as i am having  like i am excited to get to know you  yeah like you do seem like  a really like amazing person  i thought we had like a do you have a mullet  yes it is it does not go anywhere  do you want to know something ridiculous  what i was going to come in tonight  like i was going to like have you be able  to cut my hair no i am so good at it  you should have  you look terrible  these guys tonight  they were kissing us  they were planning out fun games and dates and activities  i was laughing all night  uh huh  that is considered out but we made it  good job  i finally feel like the bachelorette tonight  to tonight first rose ceremony  first actual rose ceremony first real rose ceremony  first real rose ceremony  i think we should talk about  what happened in the house with chris  um right  do you feel like you know one of us should  kind of bring it to their attention  i mean if we could bring her over here and sit her down  i speak on basically  what we talked about that night  i just i think it is important  for them to know his character  they need to know the type of guys  who are in this house and they are making decisions  based off that yeah  what he said was if you made it  to fantasy suites and if you were  the third one to go he would leave them  well i feel like because of what  they went through i feel like i you know  well they are even more sensitive  on the situation yeah exactly right  they just went to the same situation that he addressed  yeah  oh yeah they are going to want to know of course  if someone says something about me  and then you did not tell me i will actually be  more offended that you did not tell me  hello how are you doing  it is nice to finally get to talk to you  i know oh you are walking awesome  i love the suit  i have to address you know what is happening in the house  what do you mean  i think whoever overheard the conversation and does not  bring it to their attention is basically  keeping secrets from their wife  what is going on   i am overwhelmed  what if i cannot do it  like people like want to see the rachels  because she is easier  i am too complicated  it is like i am messy  i think tonight  the pressure of being the bachelorette just  it really hit me  like what did i get myself into  can i do it is it too much  can i truly find love  it is like so hard for me  i feel like i am incredibly different  than other women who have walked in my shoes  i do not always want to explain  my situation to people  it is really really hard  and i can see myself  still having guards and walls up  because um i am afraid of him  and what we might have  but i think being able to recognize it is  is the first step and then hopefully i can  move forward knowing that  thank you for everything and being here  there is like a big part of me  that worries and is really scared  that like people are not going to be able to resonate with me  and when we sat down initially like and talked  i was really just like so scared  yeah this is a huge honor  and i do not want to it up  and i am not polished  i am not like anyone they have seen in the past  i am not like rachel  not that i am comparing myself to her  because i think we are both like very different  but  i did not ever think  that this would really get to me  and then i think this week like  it is all landed so heavy like  i the right person basically for this  yeah and i think there is  still lots of like navigating  and i am sure i will like ebb and flow  but the last thing i want to do is not be who i am  it sounds like from your situation that you  like you have become like really in tune  with your emotions  and you know you have had a much different upbringing  and i think it is shaped you as a really unique person  yeah i think it has truly made me  like the woman i am today which i am really proud of  yeah but i do have  such a severely emotional side  like maybe i do not know even with my friends  like with rachel like when i love people  i love them to a point  where it like literally hurts  yeah you know but i think  i am lucky that because of my past  i have that capacity yeah  to be able to love that deeply  and like believe me i just want to have fun  i know like you know  forever and ever but like there is  to you too like there is so many different sides  that you just like i know  want your partner to know no trust me i know  and i will be as open and honest with you  and i want you to do the same  yeah because like i only have  so much time with you here  and i i really like you  and i will not hold anything back  and as much as you want out of me i am willing to give  and i am i am  i am here to see where this goes  and i do not i do not have any expectations  or anything of you but i want you to be honest  i think that is why we are both here  yeah yeah  i am trying to get comfortable with it  but seriously  thank you for everything and being here  we can go get warm  i would love love to  i think tonight was like  a huge turning point in growth  and like having taking a break  regrouping and coming back  we connected like i never ever ever would have asked  i did not expect things to be this hard this soon  i really did not  but ultimately i think it is left us  in like a way better place yeah  so  with that being said  erich will you accept this rose  i would love to accept this rose  today with erich was one of the best days  i have had so far   my feelings for him get deeper  and deeper and deeper every time  and it is scary as hell  who knows what is to come  i do just want to get on your lap  because i feel like i can get closer to you  is that close enough  i am the imperfect bachelorette  but i think in some people s eyes  it will mean perfect  and erich tonight really really really  really really let me lean into that  and understand it and be myself  because i would give anything  to be loved by someone like erich  oh my god  hello  you guys look amazing  thank you  so beautiful  today s the on date  the biggest in bachelor history  which is crazy  today no one is a bridesmaid  everyone is a bride  i think this week has brought me so much clarity  i am a little timid about being the bachelorette  i have my own fears  but i have been proven with nate and with erich  that one conversation  one day can really change your whole experience  perfect so today  i am hoping to see these guys personality  and to see how much effort they are truly willing to show  not just in the activity but towards rachel and i  whoa whoa do you see that  let us go  oh my god  when i say gabby in a wedding dress  my heart s like beating out of my chest  like it felt like i was getting ready  to go into shock  oh oh hi  wow  hi  you look like a disney princess  oh my goodness the date card said  who do you picture yourself with  hi but they are both  great women and i am like it is completely  up in the air right now  ohh  i think everyone just saw their wife for the first time  so if anyone s confused  they are a hundred times more confused now  because they look absolutely beautiful  yeah  yeah we are so excited for a fun day  i think as you guys know  rachel and i take this very seriously  so we are hoping today we can  see who we can picture ourselves with  and what better way than a classic

he is very respectful  and i truly just think he is being honest  and i appreciate it  how are you i am good  honestly today was a blast mm  you know i it is funny  because obviously i am not a model  right i am not  i do not do funny you have a great bod  i appreciate you i really do  you know and obviously i wanted this time to like  talk to you and kind of  kind of like give you a little bit more insight  on my intentions and things like that  yeah yeah  today gave me a lot of clarity  mm hmm oh good okay  and you know i i looked at that today  and my own life and like  what my values line up with  and you know i do have my intentions  fully for rachel  yeah and i think you have  the bubbly aspect to you the the goofy aspect  and you are a little bit more like  i do not want to say rough around the edges  but you all want people to be very direct with you all   and so obviously i wanted to make sure  that i expressed that to you  yeah totally  you are the best oh you are  lo and behold i have been freaking out all week  that i am not good enough to be the bachelorette  appreciate you  you do look great tonight thank you  and then hayden tells me  he feels his morals more align with rachel  and being called rough around the edges  like definitely hurts  that is my fear  um i really wanted to talk to you because  like i think we can like joke around and just be like  funny and and just because a ton of laughter  but i do not know if maybe we have had the connection  that i think i wanted to have  yeah with you from the  from the get go mm hmm  like i think like even if  like say if you were the only person here  i do not think i could have the heart to continue  because at the end of the day we are trying to find somebody  for the rest of our lives  yeah absolutely you know what i am saying  mm hmm but obviously like  you are smokin  yeah  well shoot i i am happy that  yeah i am happy we got  to have this talk though me too  yeah bye gabby  okay all right  well hey cheers yes of course  to finding our future person of course  yeah all right cool  let us get back in there and have some fun  yeah  i think these guys coming to me saying that  because i am different they do not want to be with me is  like validating that i am maybe too much for people  is this where we are sitting  do you know yeah is that yeah  ultimately like yeah it hurts to hear  but like i am sure rachel is going  through something similar  i am here for you and like thank you  i think you are beautiful and  i do feel like we have a connection  that makes me feel amazing i am so glad you said that  you know i am i am so different  than another bachelorette  so my biggest fear was being too rough around the edges  and now i am that for people  i think gabby s amazing  but you are definitely more my type  well  like when it comes down to it  like i want to be rough around the edges  because i know who i am on the inside  and i am proud of it  hello whoa  hello hi guys  tonight was really really good  a lot of guys have let me know where they stand tonight  which is a really good feeling  and i am so excited to hand out a rose  yo where is your partner in crime  i do not know where is she  you guys do something  oh there she comes  this is a very dramatic entrance  thank you thank you thank you  how are you hi good  how are you good  well thank you guys for such an incredible day  and an even better night  i had so many amazing conversations tonight  but unfortunately this can only go to one person  this person continues to make me feel really seen and safe  aven will you accept this rose  of course i will  whoa  today the photo shoot with gabby was magical  and kind of reaffirmed my feelings and emotions  i already know i see a future with her  so i definitely have my eye on the group date rose  um i think you guys are getting a feel of who i am  and i i think i have been open with some of you  about how i have had um kind of a difficult week  coming into myself in this role  and tonight has kind of been hard for me in ways  so i feel like i cannot give a rose tonight  so i think we can say goodbye  hi what is wrong  a couple guys just had some choice words  that did not sit right with me tonight  what do you mean like hayden told me   that i was rough around the edges  what the  and jacob straight up told me  that if i was here by myself then he would leave  what the are you kidding me  no  and like i was hurt  so like did you talk to jason  no i just had a breakdown  oh my god  gabby come here  yeah i feel good but obviously that was tough  to see gabby not hand out a rose to anyone here so  for sure  did uh did uh you talk to both tonight  uh i did  wow i did i did  hayden could you please explain your conversation  like i want to know what the hell happened  yeah i just told gabby that um  respectfully my intentions were to pursue rachel  what did she say she respected that  so in in my eyes this was a positive step forward  honestly you cannot  what do they think insulting one of us is  is going to make the other li like  mm hmm like because there is  two of us they think they can act that way  yeah do you want to address it  no like do you want me  to address it no  okay whatever you need  yeah and we will talk tomorrow  i love you all right i love you  i am here to find a lifelong partner  i am not here to teach dudes how to act  i am going to kill them  i know that they know that something is up  i think that they will have time to reflect on their  and figure out what happened  but for me i kind of do not know how to proceed  or if it is going to be okay so something has to change  how are you feeling after everything  you know the big thing that happened last night  that kind of shook me a little bit  and i am sure would have shook you  was how the night ended with gabby  as i was walking out i actually passed gabby  and she it looked like she was crying to me  bro her not giving a rose out  like that was tough to watch  she is clearly feeling some type of way  or upset about something so  jacob s like yeah me and gabby  ended our relationship  jumped ship yeah and then hayden was like  well yeah i talked to gabby  and told her that i m going for rachel  you know that could like  mentally mess with you a little bit  it is just upsetting to see someone who seems  so comfortable and strong to be in a place like that  to go into that night thinking that you know  i have got another rose there is another potential  yeah to find someone you want  to spend time with and leave that upset  is like that is horrible so  yeah and it probably is  goes a lot deeper than  than we even know yeah  last night when hayden came up to me  and when i heard you know  you are rough around the edges  and i i want to be with someone different  it just like struck the deepest chord  and i literally did not know if i could continue doing this  yeah i am so sorry  that you even had to feel that way last night  i am so proud of you for even coming out  and just saying you were not going to give the rose  i think what happened last night  you know with hayden and jacob  is that they like the feeling of being able to  in a sense reject one of us  mm hmm and it is a way  of self preservation um for them to be like  i i have another option  frankly it does not matter at this point  really what they think  yeah because it is our journey  yeah of course no one has  put me in the position that you were in  and i cannot even compare it  but i definitely agree that we wanted to feel chosen  and we wanted to kind of let them  mm hmm lean either way  but it turned into something ugly  it is just so messy  yeah and we cannot move forward  if we do not make a change right now  i think it could really end in a disaster  yeah  last night gave me a lot of clarity with everything  as far as um who i am pursuing  obviously which is rachel  but obviously tonight s a big night for everyone  there is a rose ceremony right  and uh my head s in a good spot  yeah for me personally i am just a little disappointed  that i was not able to get time and so you know  i am looking forward to kind of getting time  with both of them tonight  tonight s a big night it is huge  and for my personally i am looking just for  you know more one on one time with gabby and rachel  you know i still have not decided which one i want to  you know spend all my time and energy with  but you know hopefully i can get some clarity tonight  tonight is absolutely going to be monumental  in that i think they are looking to kind of set in stone  who they want to pursue relations with  i just hope that gabby and rachel get that clarity  and can move forward with this without having to worry  about who is there for them who is not there for them  that is just where i am  i mean we all know roses are on the line  so i think this is your last chance you know  obviously to make an impression on one of these women  i am really pumped up to be honest  and i cannot wait to get this going   it is like helped with everything  in my life from like work friends and relationships  every aspect of my life oh that is amazing  like i have my power again  yeah and feel and like  it is something like as a kid  that i wish i knew and like wish i had and  yeah but i do not even know  if i am making sense no you are and i  i am in this environment i am like  what do i even say no you really are  and i think like i have like  a little bit of a similar experience  my like mom and i are estranged  she did not have the capacity  to kind of like love me as a kid  and she was like really quick to take away love  like oh you know if you do not do this and that  like you will have to go live with your dad  and it is like i do not ever want to lose my mom  like that was so scary for me  and then when i left for college  she like washed her hands of me  and did not want anything to do with me  i am sorry to hear that it is okay  but through a ton of therapy  i have kind of had to learn  how really how to allow people to love me  because i never had an example of receiving it as a child  and like i think the hardest part  is like i like love her like so much  but you know you cannot always  like she just cannot be in my life  she just does not have the tools to love me back  damn i am sorry it is okay  it is honestly like i have had like so much anxiety from it  but from that i have built like a ton of humor  and i think i have a lot of grace for other people  mm hmm but it is really hard  with dating and i have like  a lot of fears honestly  have you ever heard of like inner child work  yeah like to reparent yourself and stuff  yeah exactly mm hmm yeah  it is changed my life  it is really rare to meet a man  who appreciates therapy yeah i know  because i feel like you understand  so like when hayden was like  you are rough around the edges  i was like to you yeah i am  because yeah  you are a ass bitch  but like  that is what i was terrified of hearing  like something about me is wrong  and i am too rough and tough  yeah and like he does not deserve  for you to open up to him  like those are his issues yeah  he is projecting onto you  yeah absolutely  honestly i knew there was something about you  and that was like my intuition i think  and i am really glad like i listened to it  and i feel like this is like the validation i need  yeah i am  i am glad you listened to it  yeah  because i had good intuition about you too  like sometimes you just have to trust even though  yeah yeah  it is hard it is so hard  yeah but this is like so good  yeah i agree  tonight jason tells me that  he has been in therapy to just help him through  some things that he is been through in his life  it feels really good to know that he is  kind of on the same like life path as me  do you want to go outside  i would love to go outside  i see a lot of myself in jason  a lot of things that i did not know  i would ever see in somebody else  i feel really grateful that it was you today  i do not just like want to give you a rose  i want to give you that belief that this could go somewhere  so jason will you accept this rose  of course i would love to accept this rose  this was just what i needed to keep moving forward  it is like i never thought  i would be able or deserving to find someone  and like now it is right in front of my face  it is like such a beautiful moment  like i never thought this day would come  i just cannot believe i am so lucky  one two  oh we definitely throwing hands  oh oh my goodness  oh oh  this is my first group date alone  where they are all my boyfriends  i am just excited to spend time with them  and have this new experience with them  they chose me  hi everyone  hi how are you  i see gabby atop this boxing ring  and she is like throwing some kicks and punches  and i am just like oh my god  one she is beautiful  two definitely makes it worth the wait  today we are actually going to be   practicing the art of french boxing or savate  i brought two friends in to help  haifa and her husband kareem  gabby is looking for someone  who is willing to fight for her love  you will be competing one against another  oh god head to head  in a boxing match  we will ask you to share with her  why you are the perfect match for her  all right  gabby  i have decided that tonight  there will be a special dinner with me  and just one other person  and there will be a rose as well  all right  breaking the guns out today baby  i think it is time to finally get that one on one time  gabby this is for you  allez go go go  punch punch punch punch  two  three  four oh it is burning  seconds do not give up  the last time i talked to gabby  was the second rose ceremony which was  like it is been a long time  jump i do not i have absolutely  no clue where i stand  i need to go as hard as i possibly can  i want her to see how serious i am  and hopefully get that one on one  pom pom pom stay up  oh god no  pom pom pom  i am trying to stand out for gabby  i am a competitor so hopefully she notices today  only one person is going to get that time with her tonight  i know guys are going to be putting in  i think it is much better  that you can focus on like a select group of guys  instead of trying to go through people  who are like wishy washy which is not fair to you  yeah totally no thank you  i did not like want to be too dramatic  but rachel and i have just been going through  so much last week but yeah  but i am excited to kind of explore  same i think it will be fun  me too i miss you  i think i am worth fighting for  and i am seeing men fight for me  in their subtle and different ways  and it definitely does not go unnoticed  it looks like you guys  are tickling each other oh i know  and i think they are in it for the long haul  they are here kind of for the right reasons  that they are dedicated  i need an oxygen tank  right now i just feel so hopeful  my date with tino went really well  he truly has turned it around for me  and now i am so excited to see my guys  i have not seen these guys in at least a couple days  so i have got a little surprise today  whoo bring out the boys  bring on the men  i am taking them on gabby s date  let us go let us go  it is a chance to have a little interaction  or a little conversation  before our own group date tomorrow  so we do our walkouts  and they have got people in the stands  and then there is all rachel s guys down there too  whoo  and rachel s there like oh my god  this is like ridiculous  yeah  let us get it on  whoo whoo  it is good to see you guys  hey miss you guys  good to see you  my boys are being so aggro  not one of them looked at me  look at them  look at the eyelines  someone look at me  one of you look at me  i am trying i am literally trying to look at them  tino s up jumping in the corner  no  yes  ladies and gentlemen please welcome nate versus erich  i have had to go a couple days  without this amazing lady  and there is a few things that i have realized  that i cannot bear to miss anymore  like the way you cross your legs when you stand  oh  how you look down when you think pensively  and the way you do this cute little head shake  when you start to talk  i pay attention to everything  and that is something i will continue to do  wow  all right gabby  when i love i love unconditionally and deeply  and i do not let a lot of people in  gabby s guys  are professing these feelings for her  and giving her these big speeches  and the whole time no one  can make eye contact with me  as much as gabby was having a moment with her guys  i wanted to have a moment with mine  or like just say something or make eye contact  no one looked at me no one sat by me no one did anything  erich working the body  a lot of body blows  i did not think i would end up here  watching some of my friends duke it out  you know i am happy to see them  but also it is the first time i have seen gabby in a while   it definitely brought up some old feelings  i am worried that i find myself  still kind of looking to the other side  johnny versus michael  oh big headshot  after the last rose ceremony  watching man after man reject me  michael  i think everyone should have been  trying so hard to have a moment with me  quincey and mario  dude  it really just does feel like a big insecurity  that continues to reveal itself  the wanting to have someone who makes you feel  like you are the only person here  and that they are invested in you  gabby if i get down on one knee for you  i have to get back up and fight  and that is what i am going to do today  i have been through so much rejection  it is really easy to get down on yourself and feel unwanted  gabby i would love to laugh together  for a lifetime with you  no one cares  oh  today just made it that much  more apparent to me that i just have no idea where anyone is  tonight i am awarding this big fat belt  i am by myself as gabby s up there  feels like no one s trying at all  to spencer  i am having too many of these moments  it is like how much more can i take  no one cares  wow hey  i am proud of you  you did good out there you did good out there  my boy appreciate you  i am so done  i really appreciate you  like choosing like me to come  you tried really hard  and that is what matters thank you  that is what matters that is why you are here  tonight i am spending the evening with spencer  he is tall dark and handsome  and he is been in the military  coming from a military family i find that pretty attractive  i really enjoyed like my my service  mm hmm i do not i think  did your dad right mm hmm  there is a lot of things people can do to better  you know the world around them  and that was just kind of my path  you know i felt kind of indebted to  wow not a lot of people feel like that  that is really special  i appreciate you saying that  growing up in a military family  i feel like it really is special  yeah  after the group date  i feel kind of just rejuvenated  i feel like i am truly building  these really strong connections  right now i feel so disappointed and hurt  today was gabby s date and it was all about her and her guys  but my guys were totally ignoring me  they were in their own world with their own friends  spencer came out hot  two big punches  and then kirk just was just like what is going on  and after that last rose ceremony  like it really is tough because i just  genuinely feel like no one s here for me  yeah it just feels li it feels like a lifetime  since we have actually had  some real time with her yeah  last time we saw her was what in la  the rose ceremony  yeah in la  we saw her tonight did not we  oh well not tonight before that  before tonight  at this point i want to feel chosen  i am not here to beg these guys to act like they want me  i think walking into the room after last rose ceremony  i kind of felt kind of elated in a sense  yeah i felt having been chosen  which i feel really really lucky  and that means a lot  i am just so over feeling like this  it is like  i do not know why i feel more insecure  more desperate on the side of being the bachelorette  than i did on the side of being a contestant  on clayton s season  truly he made me feel more wanted  than these guys make me feel  you know seeing the rest of the guys was really cool  yeah looking forward to tomorrow  and kind of compete and get in after with you guys  i hope it is something competitive  like the other guys did  truly it hurts your feelings  because you are supposed to be the only thing they care about  i feel like gabby s guys get it  this is such a roller coaster  like every day it is like  a really good day or a really bad day  and i do not know how i am supposed to fall in love  when i am having mostly bad days  i do not feel like i deserve to be the bachelorette   we have all been in the doghouse  a rose ceremony not going great you know  we are in a new country  a new chance for everyone really  so i am excited it is and that is a good  that is a great way to look at it  oh wow  oh  whoa  as you guys can see i am pretty upset  i think i went through a lot at the last rose ceremony  and i was really looking forward  to the next time i saw you guys  you did accept my rose you did tell me  you want to be here and i do want you all here  but you really made me feel hurt and unseen  i want you guys to want to be here for me  and i did not feel that tonight at all  i felt like i was trying so hard  to just make eye contact with someone  and no one was looking at me no one came over  and every single moment you get  we do not get that many  so any chance you get just to have a little moment  could have meant a lot to me tonight  i feel like my feelings are just extremely hurt  and it is hard for me to sleep on it tonight  and go in tomorrow and pretend like this did not happen  because i was upstairs crying about it  i just genuinely do want to have these moments with you  and i have not seen a lot of you guys in a while  and it is good to have you guys here  but it is just hard for me  especially after kind of what i went through  at the end of the day this is what we are here for  so i want to like remind you guys  because it did hurt my feelings  the shock on their faces  no one even knew what i was coming from  no one knew  there was definitely an opportunity  yeah i think we that one up  i am just so over this  i am so done and i hate every single day  having to get to the point of wanting to leave  tomorrow s a huge day now  even bigger than it was before  today we are going on a group date with rachel  last night rachel was very very upset  seeing her that disappointed  and sad last night i mean that just was a gut punch  hi guys  get in there dude absolutely gorgeous really  thank you  it is not a good feeling  seeing the person that you are dating  with tears in her eyes  feeling like she was not noticed  it was a poor reflection on everybody  and i take full fault for that  you got to be better  in la i gave each one of you a rose  to come on this journey with me  and i just really want to feel chosen back  and i did not yesterday  and it was tough for me today to show up  and i really want to move forward  and i want to get past this  and i really hope that today you guys can prove  that you do choose me and you do want to be here  so you guys want to head inside  yes absolutely  all right let us go  after seeing gabby at the fight  it put a different context on today s group date  i need to find complete clarity  that rachel and i have that kind of  lightning bolt connection that can stick  oh my goodness  there is this french couple  they just kept making out  we just stood there and were like  do they know we are here  have no idea what we are doing  so this will be fun and interesting  oh  we did not see you there  bonjour  bonjour  bienvenue  so guys these are my two friends flora and boris  and they are experts in all things romance  gentlemen the french are the most  romantic people in the world  and today we get to experience  the art of romance  we are going to take you through a series of tasks  and everything is for seducing rachel  do not forget  today s date is all about  the art of romance and pursuing your partner  take a seat  and i think today will put these men  to the test french style  flirting is an very important step  in any romantic relationship  so let us get started  zach i am up all right  thank you  the first task we have to do   is to flirt with rachel  i want to make this just as perfect as i can  oh  sorry what are we doing  we are going to dance okay  but is this how you approach people at a bar  uh  is this how you flirt with them  i hope not  okay eh  what do you guys think about this  what is that  i you guys can stop me is he choking me  oh am i choking  oh this is bad  we flirted  not well but it happened  ooh  a lot of guys were kind of grabbing rachel  and dancing and holding her  oh i do not know  i do not think rachel was that into it  a little awkward  peter  oh okay  you are only in france once  showing off your flirtatious abilities  so you got to go all out  what oh  ethan s crawling up to her  he is giving a lot of energy  a little sex panther kind of look going on  even though i made a total fool of myself  just seeing her smile and laugh  it made me feel really good  the second test is one by one  we have to put on a show french kissing our own fists  oh there we go  tongue lips teeth  there was noises  it was disgusting  oh okay  so the next task was the armpit smelling  and what the actual hell was that  there you go  i do not know  no no do not do not do that  oh come on  rachel almost fainted  that is none of my business what he is got brewing  in that armpit stew  okay  it is a little different but good  i feel like  definitely did not expect to be doing that ever in my life  you just got to embrace it  and i think everyone is pretty much on the same page  just trying to make this day as special as possible  make her feel as special as possible  next one is you will write a love letter to rachel  writing love notes is the most romantic gesture you can do  at the end of all this i hope i am your guy  i just love how we both grew up watching planes fly  i want to be someone you can count on  someone you can trust  and most importantly someone you can love  you guys you make me feel so special  i came into today feeling super low  and having a really rough night  but these guys really did turn it all around  our adventure s coming  there s no need to rush  from logan with love  it is really showing me how much they care  i could tell that they want to change  and they want me to feel better  last night i wrote something  and i was hoping i would get an opportunity today  i would wake up happy at just the thought of her smile  my plans for the day making sure  she always knew i would go that extra mile  i finally felt like i had a purpose in this world  and i would do whatever i could for this girl  though i may get hurt once again  it s worth every second to feel again  mi amour  so sweet  right now i feel noticed and supported  and uplifted by all of these guys  and i feel wanted  it just is such an incredible feeling  thank you all i can tell you guys seriously put  so much effort into it  and that is all i asked for today  so from the bottom of my heart thank you  i do have a dinner tonight  and there is going to be a rose there  and the decision is so difficult  i am going to take a little bit of time  to decide who i want to take on the date tonight  it would really mean the world  if i got that one on one  there is a lot more i want to say  and you know a lot more i want to know about her  i am a bit torn at the moment  i have gotten to know rachel as this wonderful person  but i did not feel a strong spark and connection  and i walk away from the group date  thinking about gabby   i have been wanting waffles since i got here  i m just like yes  it looks so amazing  wow  that is really good  is not it  ooh  you are going under yeah  this is not natural to hang out with like six guys  and one girl but what resonates with her is people  are willing to put themselves out there  and to make her feel wanted  so that is what i am trying to do  and she looks amazing so it is like  it is a fun day so far  full of surprises  so as long as we do not have to physically fight each other  i am up for any surprise at this point  okay yo we better d up  swing it swing it swing it  god these kids are good  ooh clear it out clear it  come on oh  first time i think i have played soccer in years  those kids are no joke  they are good they are going between my legs  but you got to win somehow  all right i am going to start picking these kids up  it is so fun to see the guys interact with little kids  nate you can tell is immediately  comfortable around kids which is no surprise  because he is a dad  just score one goal  but really everyone is diving right in  and it is kind of enlightening  to take a peek into the future  you guys did so good  the belgian boys won the soccer match fair and square  but i know my guys are pretty competitive so i have  another surprise for them  oh  out of nowhere this big burly belgian guy  brings out these two buckets of fish  come  and he is like  you we are going to play a belgian game  you know this  rock paper scissors  okay okay one  i win  wait oh god  that is the belgian game  i am not accustomed to a lot of belgium games  but i would like to find the person that made this game  and give him a piece of my mind  rock paper scissors shoot  oh  here it goes  here he goes  this is my friend flipper here  oh say what up flipper  what up dawg  you know i feel like gabby likes me  yeah she was feeling you  she didn t want you to see you slapped by us  but you know what yolo  for sho for sho  in america this is how we play  instead of slapping the face  oh  that was a great day but the highlight was the kiss  i saw an opportunity to go for the kiss and i went for it  why not  i do not know how they felt when i kissed gabby  but i do not really care  thank you for choosing this date  we are having a great time  oh i am so glad  yeah  no it means so much  and really when i say like i look at you guys  and i truly do feel like the luckiest girl in the world  and i cannot believe that i am here with all of you  we all felt like we had a good amount of time  with her today myself included  so it is it is just refreshing  to not have to worry about drama  and only worry about the relationship  so excited to continue it into the evening portion  today was a testament to like our group  we really do get along and we are all respectful  ooh there is one rose  whittling down the group to such a small number of guys  is the best move ever  we are all going to get so much time tonight  and i am excited to continue to grow  gabby and i s relationship  i thought that was a really special day  just like getting out in like a spring day in bruges  sharing that with gabby and you guys was really cool  i am looking forward to tonight as well  so it is just like i think everything s  kind of going in a positive way  so i am excited  well since it is a smaller group of us  i do not think that we are going to have to worry about trying  to steal time or worry about when we are going to grab her  so it is going to make it easier to focus on the conversation  that we want to have with gabby  toast to a great first day here in belgium  and toast to a great night with gabby  cheers cheers  i am still a little salty about the kids that  whupped us in soccer but you know  i think we need a rematch with those kids tomorrow  oh oh  oh the hell  what side of the park you on  what is going on  how is everybody  i am sure you guys are curious why i am here  i would be too  i originally had a connection with gabby  but i decided i was going to pursue rachel  because she saw something in me  and she told me that we could have something special  as time went on i did not quite see the same thing   so i met with rachel and i told her  i can no longer see you  and i had a conversation with gabby  and i got word today that she wants me  to have an opportunity to pursue her  i am just confused right now  logan is hopping over to team gabby and it is just  it is just i do not i do not get it  i guess we were thinking that she saw like  her person in the guys here and for someone else  to be added i just do not know what to think right now  i will be moving in with you guys as well  so let us have a good night  hi  it is upsetting that logan is here  because logan would not be here  if gabby did not want to explore that relationship  so it makes me question how strong really is  my relationship with gabby or gabby s relationship  with any of the other guys here  i just wanted to say thank you guys  for such a good day  i feel like i had so much fun  and logan is here  um i am sure you all have spoken  we did yeah  yeah  logan came to me yesterday you know  to express his feelings so  yeah here we are  happy to be here  thank you  so let us make a toast to an amazing day  and relationships flourishing and still some to explore  cheers  cheers cheers  cheers  i am worried about tonight because knowing how far i am  along with these men i do not ever want  to jeopardize that by having logan come along  this late in the game  but i really do want to be open to all possibilities  and i hope that the guys understand  where i am coming from  this is a big night  you just kind of brought on logan like  yeah  you know when you do introduce something like that  like and you already have  these established relationships  and you do not know like logan s been  back and forth a little bit  and i want to let you know that i am all in  thank you  and i think that you are awesome  and i am very much about you and so  i am not anyone that would make you question anything  and hopefully my words carry weight  yeah  like i do really care for you  i know your heart is in such a good place  like i can tell you are ready for a relationship  it is never been a doubt in my mind  and i appreciate that about you  yeah  i just did not see that coming you know from logan  i thought he was like crazy about rachel  or maybe he is the most calculated dude here  yeah  i wonder if he gets the group date rose  i kind of feel like that is going to happen  that would be so annoying  the addition of logan it is a wake up call  and it has some of the guys including myself  on alert to kind of reevaluate like  where you stand  i always try to be like as open as possible  and just try to show you of me  and it was just fun today  like it just felt like so natural  like we just got to be together  yeah yeah  the only bloop was obviously the new logan addition  but even then like yeah how did you  like how did you take it  so i at first i saw him and i was like okay  this is what s going on  but honestly you should explore every relationship  like i want to be chosen yeah  so just know that you have my support in all of this  yeah you do  no thank you  i am really like so grateful for you guys  and just like being here with you  i know group settings are so hard  it kind of like  it is hard for me too to have it be hard for you  it is all right  with each week i have gotten closer to each of the guys  and our connections do grow stronger  each and every time that i see them  so with logan coming in late i think emotions are high  but ultimately i hope that they just trust me  how are you  i am good i mean i do not know  i obviously like have feelings for you  and i think i am like still like flying  off that like one on one time where i thought we had  like such this amazing connection  and it just felt like us  and then this is like six guys and you and it just  i do not know  it like started to feel like very real in that sense  yeah  and i was like used to being like  stealing you away like for a kiss or something like that  and it just like felt i do not know  it did not feel like that natural  sometimes it is kind of hard having earlier one on ones  because then like so much progresses afterwards  but i do think about you a lot  and sure i think we could probably grow some more   but i think there is time  yeah i will take the kiss that i did not get to steal today  yeah just this kiss  as someone that feels like that they are fighting  for a group date rose to see logan come in  you know naturally you are like okay you know  do i have a shot tonight  like have you already made up your mind  it does kind of muddy the waters a bit  if logan did get the rose it would speak volumes  to where her intent lies  we will see how things shake out but it is a little unsettling  i kind of cannot believe that i am  getting to sit here with you  oh i know  i bet you have been going through  like so much these last days or weeks  do you feel like kind of good  i feel great yeah  i mean this is what i wanted to be sitting here  holding your hand you know yeah  and i realized like what you had to go through in order  to just like get me to sit on this couch with you  it was like you had to have difficult conversations  and like you did that and let me be here  and this is where i want to be  like really  yeah  like i am very into you  so i am glad to be here  yeah  yeah me too  i think the premise of everything  is to listen to your heart and try and find  a way to do it with integrity which you did  so that means a lot thank you  yeah yeah  sitting with gabby there is no doubt in my mind  that i made the right choice  it is time to pursue gabby in a way that is fierce  and in a way that i can make up for lost time  and if i got the group date rose i would be pretty excited  i did want to thank you guys honestly for such a great day  unfortunately i just have one rose to give  i wish i could give you them today  so  nate will you accept this rose  yes  ah you need to go through this sweater  yeah  oh i am so happy that i got the group date rose  it is my first one so it is amazing  we even added a guy tonight and i thought  that it could have been him but she gave it to me  and i am so  i am so elated  it sucks  like i went into tonight feeling very good  about like our talk  but nate got the group date rose  and we have logan here now so i do not necessarily know  like ranking wise where i stand  but i do not need to be here for like eight more weeks  just to see what happens  like that is just a waste of my time so  i woke up this morning feeling good  last night i made a fantastic reconnection with gabby  i think maybe there is still a little tension  with a couple of the guys about the fact  that i am getting to switch over  and that is okay with me  i did not think this would be a popular decision  i am just trying to follow my heart  but i did hurt rachel and i really hope  she finds what she is looking for on this journey  wow this is adorable  i am just so happy to be here with you truly  i am so happy to be here with you too  yeah when my name was like left off the group date card  mm hmm i was just lit up  i was like yes finally  i feel like we have always had like such a solid  like base from the beginning mm hmm  and i feel like whenever anything happens like  you are the first person i want to see  i feel really safe with you  i love that  i do have very strong feelings for aven  i have since the beginning  but i had a rough couple days in belgium  so today i just really need to know  that it is a two sided connection  and that we both feel that way  and it is not just coming from me  this is so cool this is amazing  i am so happy you are here with me  i know  i missed you i missed you  i have been looking forward  to this one on one with rachel  and now that it is here i am really excited  you know the things that rachel s  been through up to this point have not been easy  so i cannot wait to explore the city  and just try to make today as special as possible  and you know just reassure her  that i am here for her only  when is your birthday  november   what is you zodiac sign  scorpio i am a pisces  oh let us go  ooh it must be a match check  right off the bat aven is one of the most  handsome men i have ever seen  and we are exploring bruges  which is one of the most romantic places  i have ever been to  and that is all i want today is romance  i love chocolate what do you think  i am in do you want to go in  let us do it oh my gosh  oh oh my all right oh my gosh  it smells so good  so we are getting hefty today  ready  mmm  aven is such a great person  he is so funny  he makes me laugh  how do you do that  i do not know  this is a hidden talent  and we have always had a good physical connection  but he is really stepping it up  you know touching me and kissing me  and making me feel desired and wanted  hi  what you guys doing over here  sewing  we no no no no no  we are making lace  it is a very a tradition since the th century in belgium  oh wow  that is incredible  so if you choose him what will be the wedding like  it would be a very big wedding  big wedding what we do is wearing a veil  wow  so now you have to close your eyes  just pop it over  oh  now you can see if he is good kisser  ah  leave it on  oh  beautiful  i have never kissed someone with a veil on my head  but it feels right  a wedding is something that i definitely  feel like could be in our future  that looks beautiful on you what do you think  can we just take this one to go  can we get this gift wrapped  yeah  aven is so romantic  it just feels like everything today  has just been so perfect  i love spending the day with him  oh i think we are here  oh my god look at this view  i already feel like we have such a strong connection  so tonight i cannot wait to get to know him more  so excited  i know  i did not expect to come back here  i know but i am happy we are here  it is really scary to begin to get these feelings  after you  because i do not want to get hurt  and as much as i do not think aven would hurt me  it is still in the back of my mind  because i just feel like no one can really blame me  that a shoe could drop  so i hope i can learn more about him  and feel confident giving him that rose tonight  i have been really looking forward to this date with you  for a while now and i cannot wait to get to know you more  but i just wanted to thank you for the best date  of course absolutely  cheers cheers  well i had just an amazing day as you did  definitely exceeded well well beyond  i know  it was the best day with you  and i would love to hear more about you and your life  and what makes you the way you are  yeah  well i think i told you like when we first met  stability is a big thing for me  feeling secure and that someone is  like not just going to dip out at any point  is like huge for me  growing up my parents were like never together  you know i lived with my mom for a few years  and then i moved to with my dad for like the rest  of my life basically  and so how old was it  i was ten which was tough  i did not want to do it  i was like i don t want to be here  can you send me back type of thing  and i did not get to see mom that often  you know our relationship to some extent  was like through a phone for a while you know what i mean  which was tough like in high school and it sucked  and honestly like you know  you want to have like a stable relationship  with both your parents but i just really  never saw her that much  so you know me and my mom got really close  when i got older because of all the time  that we did not have when i was younger  so in regards to all that she kind of made something for me  and it is kind of like a good luck  good energy type of thing  so it is like this little like rubber bracelet thing  she made this yeah  oh my gosh  and kind of seeing how you know  these last couple of weeks have been tough for you  i think like if you hold on to it for a while  maybe it will like turn your experience in all this  around for a little bit you know so  well you are turning this around just starting with that  yeah  but this is honestly incredible  it is been a tough week for rachel so i want to just  like be as open as possible and there to be no grey area  with how i am feeling in this moment  and i want to just kind of do my best to remind her  that i am here for her  i truly have had the most incredible day with you   and i only wish we had more time  because i just think we have such an incredible connection  could not agree more  so aven will you accept this rose  absolutely of course i will  and i just wanted to say i am so honored  that we are on this path together  and i truly look forward to the moments  that we get to spend together moving forward  asking me for more one on ones  i am very very happy about how today went  i mean it was an amazing night from start to finish  and i have never felt this like strong of a connection  or this natural of a connection  you know so quickly  oh my god  every moment i spend with rachel our feelings  are getting stronger and stronger for each other  and i really do see rachel as someone  who could be my future wife and somebody that i do want  to spend the rest of my life with  i feel so happy  tonight is the perfect night with aven  he is been there to support me  and he has chosen me immediately  and he is never wavered  i could easily see myself falling in love with aven  and i feel like i am almost there  what is up johnny johnny  you missed one hell of a day was it cool  what did you guys do it was crazy  so we are all hanging out around the couch area  and someone walks up  yeah logan  no  although he is been with rachel  he has feelings for gabby  is he coming over he is over  yeah mm hmm  how do you feel  i was bummed yeah  the fact that logan is here you know we start to question  like is gabby questioning  her connections with the rest of us  that is like that is what is kind of  going through my head too as i go on this one on one  it is like what connection do they have  that i got to kind of step up  that is fair oh  oh whoa  what is up guys logan  going into my date with gabby  with logan coming over  it is going to be a little weird  but i am going to try to you know compartmentalize that  right gentlemen i got a date i got to get to  i am out of here all right take care johnny  peace guys bye johnny  me and gabby right now we vibe  we know there is a connection  you know we have admitted that we are into each other  but this is not looking for a fling  this is looking for someone that is forever  so i am over the moon to finally get  some one on one time with her  gabby  what so  come on no yeah  i got you i got you  wait  i am excited to spend the day with johnny  johnny and i have fun  i have a fun day planned in the countryside of belgium  beautiful love it  he is like so macho and too cool for school  which normally i would hate but he pulls it off  because he is like kind of goofy  but good relationships are all about balance  the fun side and the emotional  and the serious side  with johnny i do not quite know if we have a balance yet  but today i am excited to see where things go  welcome  thank you  gabby  this is beautiful  we are so excited to be here  we started already actually  oh you did  without us  so my name is ann  i am actually sixth generation in a family brewery  which is called the half moon  this is vincent  nice to meet you nice to meet you  the brewer of the beers  speaking of beer let us go taste it  let us go  yeah  he has a one track mind  oh hell yeah this is right up my alley  whoa yum  gabby s hands down  the coolest girlfriend i have ever had  she brought me to belgium  and she took me to a beer farm  it just made me that much more attracted to her  so smell it  you can swirl it a little get out the flavors  cheers  oh  you are enjoying this huh  we have an activity for you to do together  oh cool  that is great  yay  oh my god  i actually do not know what this is  is this a spa day  i think so  is this a spa day  a bruges  so you drink this  immerse your entire body into the beer  oh i bet you can  you could definitely drink that   i love spa days that is where i thrive  did you bring your speedo  yeah actually that is what i am putting on  so we are going to soak in beer maybe drink the beer  have a little fun in between and hopefully get weird  nice and hard  yes love it  harder harder  do you like it  does not feel great does that kind of hurt  no your turn try me  no free rides no  i would never act like this on a first date  you hit me in my face try it one more time  no free rides  usually i am more laid back and not so assertive  but gabby is definitely pulling it out of me  wow that feels amazing  does it that is sandpaper  oh no  watching johnny be so comfortable  and kind of leaning into the craziness is so special  that is beer  is it beer that is beer  this is the kind of person i would want  to do these things with and this is the kind of person  i can see myself with  you drink it  i did not drink it  i spit it out  do not do that that is bad for you  but johnny and i have not had really  intense conversations yet and have kind of  remained surface level  oh my god  oh my god this is beautiful  and i need someone who can be there for me and be vulnerable  and vice versa  so i am excited to see if johnny can go there tonight  like today honestly was so strange for me  because i never act like that  but i do like when i am by myself in my room  no i feel like yeah it is just like super hard  to get out of my comfort zone like that but  yeah  clearly today i was like let s get in that tub  yeah  right no i loved it  you are like funnier than i thought  i was like super nervous going into it  i am not going to lie  oh you did not seem like it  do you feel like you are just like kind of guarded  or it takes you a while just as a person to be weird  i am a freak yeah i know  no i think it is both  i think like i am super guarded at first  and then it just takes a while too  i think it is just because like past relationships  and i feel like once i got to that point of like  being like myself it just like ended  you had said you were in one kind of recently no  yeah but then i like started to be myself  and she like just disappeared on me  i think that was like really hard  yeah  and that was like the last time  i really like let my guard down  yeah  it is so hard with relationships because i think  it is impossible to not take it personally  yeah and i think when you i exude confidence  yeah i am like no that is not me  i do not i am like the least confident person ever  which is crazy but yeah  i think you have a lot to be confident about  i even see it really like with you and the guys  i feel like people like being around you for who you are  i do not see it but like i am like so hard on myself  i feel like yeah  i think i seriously lack like some serious confidence  to where like i should probably like you know talk  to people about it or whatever but  i definitely struggle with it  like just depression and like really  feeling bad about yourself  and i feel like i have felt like at an all time low  the time for like no reason too  mm hmm yeah  no i can definitely  i feel like i relate  i have struggled a lot with anxiety and depression  in my life and i have had to relearn so many things  that i did not get to learn as a kid  and as an adult it hits you and you just think  i am kind of exactly  yeah like i am broken and nobody else understands  but i think we just have to be like easier on ourself  a little bit  tonight johnny is saying things to me that i do not know  if he is really said to anyone recently  but i think that is such an important part  of a relationship is the willingness to be vulnerable  and he is shown that in so many ways today  i had a lot of fun today me too  like a lot of fun  me too  i did not want that to end yeah  can we do it again please  yeah yes  um  but just like you said that i bring out a side in you  i feel like you do the same with me  like i never have to be reserved around you you know  so johnny yes  will you accept this rose  of course  i am so happy right now  this rose means pretty much everything in the world  from the beginning this whole thing has been natural   whew i said it out loud  i said it out loud  tonight zach tells me he is falling in love with me  oh my gosh this is really working and this is happening  and to hear it from zach  especially after the most incredible day  it is really the best way to end it  and i just feel so happy and i feel like  just ecstatic  it is not a tulip  not a tulip  zach  getting to hear more of what made you you  i just feel really honored to know you  and i feel really lucky to have you here  but most of all i am so confident that  i would love to meet your family if you would have me  so with that being said  zach will you accept this rose  more than anything in the world  i am feeling like i am on cloud nine  being on this journey and meeting rachel  and having these experiences with her  i could not be happier  okay are you ready  i am ready let us go  i think my family is going to adore rachel  she is compassionate and sweet and thoughtful  which is something i have always looked for  and something that my family does want for me  after tonight  engagement feels and seems like a very very real possibility  what is that  what  no way  i definitely feel like tonight  has brought zach and i closer together  this is so amazing  i see so much potential for zach and i in the future  i think that we have such a playful relationship  but we do still have those serious  and vulnerable conversations  and we are able to be emotional with each other and open up  after everything he is told me and the most amazing day  it was just so perfect  nate is such a good dude  that was obviously a tough thing that happened today  and i am i am sure she is going through it right now so  i am sure she will not be able to just wipe this away  whatever happened  at the end of the day like she needs our support  especially after a hard day like today  i cannot imagine what that must have been like  oh gabby  hi  want to sit down oh thank you  yeah  what is up  um you all right  i think you guys know like  um  i nate is not here  um  i think like  at some point you know things get really real obviously  and i had to be honest with both of us  and that i am just not at a point in my life  where i could maybe assume the responsibility of being a mom  and  i do not like it is hard  because it is not something you can really control and  sorry you guys are like probably really freaked out  no not at all it is tough  we have been thinking about you all day  day we were just like can we give her a hug  and just be there for her because we knew  you made me emotional this is this is tough  this is like really hard so  thank you  i want you guys to know everything you know  i wanted you to like hear it from me now  because i did not want you guys to wonder  can i give you a hug  yeah can we hug you yeah  can we give you some hugs  thank you  sorry  today for me was the realest  rawest day that i have had  thank you of course gabby  i was so scared of how the men would react  but they were all really understanding  thank you for sure  i think today s pivotal  and it is hard as hell  but making these big decisions   will eventually lead to finding my partner  i will see you guys soon  later gabby bye gabby  bye good night  this morning i woke up really sad  just thinking about nate i i was not ready to say goodbye  but i know that our fundamental lives  are different at this moment and that cannot change  the men have been really supportive  of my hard time with nate  and they were all really understanding  it makes me feel really comfortable  and really confident moving forward  and potentially meeting their families  my connections are deepening so fast  and i feel positive and so hopeful for the future  and i think today is going to be  so amazing and so fun  gabby  gabby what is this you got this  kind of like this kind of thing going on  are we running  i have not been on a group date with gabby s bunch  so today i am going to be myself and let my personality  shine through and go home with a rose hopefully  gabby what is going on today  that is for me to know and you to find out  come on give mama a hug  my greatest hope for today is to get  more comfortable with each other  physically and emotionally  and i am excited to deepen our connections  to see where things go  we do have an incredible day planned  it is going to be crazy  just like everything else  just lean in as much as you are comfortable truly  so should we go in  yeah yeah let us do it  yes let us do it  the date card says let s take our love  to the edge  the edge of what  they will have to find out  ha ha  oh my god  yo i cannot  we open the door there is this woman  she is there with the slicked back hair  the tight leather outfit and she is like  not messing around at all  i do not know if i am aroused  or if i am just like scared  i think all of us were like oh my god  what the hell are we getting ourselves into  hi guys  i am here to whip you guys in shape  oh  people all around the world  they come to amsterdam to explore their fantasies  to be open minded  to do some maybe dirty things  so i am here to help you guys  to communicate with gabby  and to explore things you can do with each other  because sex is so important in a relationship  today we are going to talk about   knocking boots   hanky panky  also known as sex  how many of you  know how to treat a woman in the bedroom  uh  yeah  i feel like i did but now i do not i do not know  yeah i am kind of questioning  there is no whips usually  so i helped a lot of couples  to find out their boundaries their sexual desires  and what is very important is your safe word  so now you have to figure out what your safe word is  um pumpkin  pumpkin pumpkin  okay cruise ship  cruise ship  um uh albuquerque  what  that fits you well  you cannot really confuse that word  with any other word right  how about like asbestos  or something like that  my safe word was asbestos  it is a toxic chemical  it is just unwanted especially in the bedroom  i have some very nice questions for you guys  oh my god  and do not lie to me  if you do lie to me i bring this  uh oh  jason do you enjoy giving  oh my god  this is not what i was expecting we were going to do  honestly one of my worst nightmares  i am not answering this  ah why not  i will talk to gabby personally  i think that is a yes  oh okay  erich  hello erich  erich  i have a question for you hi  how often and be honest  do you  susie comes in first with like  the really hard questions  things that we are standing there being like  uh i do not know how to answer this  so you have to answer  otherwise i am going to use my whip  use it it is going to be very hard   do your worst  susie s got a very quick whip  and she is also very uh pressuring with the questions  johnny have you slept with more than ten women  um  do you know who i am  i am from palm beach florida  is it more than ten   um  hmm  hundreds  pumpkin  this next exercise will maybe even trigger  your flight or fight response  johnny  i feel like the guys came in nervous naturally  but i knew johnny was going to be great today  do you want my clothes off susie  yes is that what you want  i would love that  he is been hilarious he is leaning in  whoo hoo oh  whoa johnny  i think he is really comfortable with himself  stop no  and this situation so i appreciate that  he is kind of like leading the way for all the guys  do not do it this is my nightmare  stop  are your feet ticklish  okay a little bit ticklish yes you are  all right right all right stop  why are there so many distance  because i was i was doing a slow approach right  ah okay okay i was making it more  just building up the suspense  okay you are going to build up  are you afraid of her  albuquerque it is a good safe word right  spencer is a very diligent army guy  lower it just give it to me  we are definitely not in his natural element  i will tell you that  oh my god what did we sign up for  take off your shirts and take a seat on the ground  have some little stripping  make yourself comfortable  was kind of hoping today would be  a deep dive into who we are and what we represent  and i am just kind of blindfolded  laying on a shag carpet waiting for her  to rub whipped cream on my nipples  sexually i am extremely open  my motto is i will try anything twice  way harder  go harder  ah  oh  oh what  i feel like i went all out and that is all i can do  johnny what happened  today for me was just what i needed  dude  this is a first who is ticklish  i think we all put ourselves out of our comfort zone  is this shaving cream or whipped cream  they have all blown me out of the water  and truly impressed me  and i am excited with the potential  of handing out a hometown rose tonight  you guys did great yeah thank you  the group date was  it was interesting definitely had some fun  we just got to laugh and get to know each other better  and i think gabby had fun so that is what matters  i definitely want to talk to gabby about  like hometowns and all those things tonight  i am really looking forward to it honestly  cheers boys who knows what is going to happen  yes cheers  to whatever happens  cheers we had a crazy group date  now tonight we have a cocktail party  i feel like i did enough at the group date  i feel like i kind of was the only one  who put myself out there  but the mood is tense  because it is my last chance  to talk to gabby before hometowns  oh god  so logan  yeah what the logan just is not here  like is he sleeping  something is up  hey hi  i am sorry to pop up unannounced  yeah you got a second to chat  sure okay  you mind if i come in not at all  thank you  um i know you are really excited about tonight  mm hmm but we do have  a bit of a situation with one of your guys  logan tested positive for covid  oh  he is doing fine  but because we are trying to take a real abundance  of caution for yourself for the rest of the guys   we have to cancel tonight s cocktail party  i know how important it was and how much  you were looking forward to it with obviously  hometowns on the horizon  you doing okay  i was really looking forward to tonight  but i feel for logan  i obviously hope that he is feeling okay  and i hope he knows that we are wishing the best for him  and want him to get better fast  yeah  right i am going to go tell the guys  again i am so so sorry  yeah me too  you all right yeah  get some sleep okay thank you  get some rest see you  okay  i feel terrible for logan  but mainly i want his health and his safety to be okay  but i also truly feel bad for the other guys  there is a rose on the table tonight so i am sure that  the guys are probably going to be really shocked  it is logan  oh it is jesse  oh god oh god  my heart is beating out of my chest  gentlemen  jesse how we doing  relatively okay we will see  i did have to come and share some news  with you all about tonight  as you can probably tell by now logan s not here  there has been a situation with logan  and because of that there is no after party  can you tell us if he is okay  logan s doing his yeah logan s doing okay  okay  i know how bad you needed this tonight  hometowns are on the horizon  but my advice to you all is to get some sleep and hopefully  tomorrow you will get that time with gabby that you need  good night fellas  good night jesse see you jesse  dude  i am feeling really sad  i have four men left  and i really really needed tonight  to help me figure out who was going to hometowns  it is kind of a pit in my stomach you know  that i have to make this decision  i am not sure if i am in a place where i can confidently  give out a hometown rose to all the guys  well that was weird  wish we got to see gabby tonight  i think i was one of those people  who really needed that time  yeah there is

rachel  this is the final round  okay lift off  you guys look like it is easy  rachel s worth any test  you know if i have to smell like cheese  the rest of the day i am willing to do it  who is going to be first that guy right now  tyler yours is falling behind you  i am sweaty  i did not expect us  having to hold it for that long  my hands are cut my wrists are cut  i am just like oh god this is going to look bad  aww  oh aven  thank god aven went out like right after me  then it came down to tino and ethan  let us go boys  i know you can do it let us go boys  ethan yeah  i will make you a deal kay  if you put yours down first  i will do it right after you ethan do not buy it  i could do this all day  all day keep going  i am sweating so bad thank you rachel  i have you on the ropes  oh  oh god you were so good  you did so good  thanks  we are going to kiss right  oh ethan  tino you know did well  unfortunate that i did not come out victorious  oh here i will take care of you  okay  all right i am good  are you okay holy  i just saw an angel  oh it is you  you know i can feel it with rachel it is there  i think our affection is very palpable  so i just need to continue on that  and show her why i deserve to bring her home  what is up what is wrong  i got all cut up that kind of sucked  fortunately right afterwards  rachel came over to check up to make sure i was okay  ouch  the only cure is a kiss from rachel so   i can give you that  that sounds good  finally i got my time i feel really good  thank god  she was like that worked out  and now the big moment  the cheese king of edam is  tino  i am the cheese king  this is so awesome  every shoulder pain and lower back pain  made every bit of it worth it  and i am going into tonight really confident  kiss kiss kiss  so i wish today might have went  a little bit differently yeah  but tino and rachel are kissing each other  while you just have to sit there and watch  it is the worst feeling in the world  but tonight is you know the night  that i really put it out there  so tino won the day but do not you worry  tyler s got tonight  do any of us still smell like cheese  or we all good  no i think you guys smell great  we all cleaned up nice  today has been so fun  but tonight it is all about me sharing who i am with rachel  i want to give her a lot of reassurance that it would  go amazingly if she wanted to meet my family  obviously there is a rose on the line  and if you get that rose you are set for hometowns  i want that rose more than anything  i want to introduce her to my family more than anything  i mean to me this is my future wife  you are getting the validation right then and there  there is nothing better  well i just wanted to say that  of course today was really fun and silly  but i just kind of wanted to reinforce  the importance of the rose tonight  i think you guys know how much i value family  and that it is something that i am going to  be putting a lot of thought into  and i just want to cheers to you guys  cheers cheers  tonight s group date rose is so incredibly important  you want to go talk yeah  it means that i am going to this person s hometown  it is like tough because i still do have really strong  connections with all these guys  choosing the group date rose tonight  it is a huge decision and i hope i can get there  i had a great day like all the activities were so much fun  and like yeah  anytime i get with you is obviously so valuable  but it did like make me realize okay  i am just like ready for the next step  i would be so honored for you to meet my parents seriously  those are like definitely definitely the two  most important people in my life  have you ever brought anyone home to meet your parents  i have  like the first one um there was some rough patches  with dad in getting along  oh he did not like her  did not think it was a good fit for me  uh oh  and he was pretty vocal about it  and then yeah  there was some rough patches with moms  in the last one  now you are making me a little nervous  no do not be nervous i am  i have no doubt in my mind that my mom is going to  absolutely adore you and my dad will love you too  you know i want them to like me but now i know that  they are definitely going to like you  i feel like i am going to go in like thinking that they are  like mm i don t know oh my god  no they are no they are not  both my parents are going to love you  they are going to love me with you  they are going to love how i am with you for sure  it makes me so happy so i am really excited  it is a pretty massive rose tonight to say the least  i think it is uh pretty rad that she did  a full blown after party with all of us  shows that she is being really thorough  rather than just you know single out from the day  we want her to choose us because she is gotten  the clarity she wants and then makes her decision  i want rachel more than anything  to me this is my person it just feels right  and tonight i am going to do whatever i can  to prove to her that i am her person too  doing the group date everything was awesome  like i was having a lot of fun  and at the end like me aven and ethan  are standing there and everyone is like chanting  i am like i don t want to look at this  i am looking at my feet oh i am sorry  i am just twiddling my feet like no but like i under  like i understood it but then like  a part of you is just sitting there just like  because you know that you are on your own journey  but when you see it you are just like damn that sucks  i know yeah  it is tough i get it  but i do like want you to know  that what you are feeling is like  so obviously real and what i feel is real  and i want you to just focus on our relationship  i do feel confident in our connection   johnny and i did have a slower start  but we do have this really strong connection  i think speaking with his family will just give me  a better grasp of him as a person and kind of where  he is at in his life right now  what are we doing  so i cannot wait to show you my town  but i miss my family and i feel like it is been forever  i think we should see them first  oh okay  nervous a little bit  i do not know what i am walking into  do not you are going to be your family  you are going to love them i feel amazing right now  here at hometowns bringing gabby home it is big  and i am nervous and it is my family  this is the first time for me  i have never sat down and gone through questions  like this with my family so today s huge  i think today s probably the biggest date i have ever had  johnny does not give his heart to just anybody  no he does not  bringing her back here and all is going to be a big thing  yep door squeaks  yo oh  oh i knew it was going to be  clapping and cheering  sup man everyone  how you doing welcome home  hi  today gabby is going to meet my mom elizabeth  my dad john nice to meet you  best friend perry my brother robert  and his girlfriend jillian  he is looking great  best case scenario we have an amazing time  my family loves her  getting on a knee is a huge thing  and so i need everything to come together today  what did you think night one  night one laughter  yes wait i rapped  i like put like a couple words together  and uh  laughter  no no but it was really smooth  it sounded better  so i was going to call it a poem  but that would almost be worse  it had rhythm  and you kept him no i did yeah  unbelievable he had confidence rhythm  the best girlfriend ever  aww that is what he always says  it is so cute  meeting johnny s family we start  telling stories right away  i watch johnny light up and he gets so excited  i felt like i had known them for years  gabby would you like to have a talk  i would love to  this is how i am with my family  and it is comforting and it is fun  i noticed when you guys are together  it is pretty amazing for such a short period of time  the chemistry you guys have  yeah no he is one  who i have always known i could be myself around  he is always been really sweet with me  and really opened up to me and we got so much closer  i think it was what we needed to know  that we could see a future i guess  so i am glad you said that because my question to you is  where do you see yourself with johnny  yeah  if he got down on one knee i know the whole  it is something that we would have to talk about  you know which we have not yet  of course  but knowing that johnny and i have your support  means a lot to me absolutely  i know it means so much to him  i think you are great  hell you know we are all in  yeah both laughing  gabby s great she really is  i think they would be perfect together  the way they play off each other  and i was really happy to see my son happy  and i hope this is the love he finds  i remember him coming out of the limo  and i was like oh my god  really that s my type yeah  and then he has this charisma about him  his blue eyes and his eyelashes  right  i do not think you can really get  resist yeah  the connection with you and johnny seems very organic  yeah whether it is for now or ever  i think it is really really cool  yeah do you think that he is like ready  to be in a long term relationship  well the thing about johnny is  he does not give his heart to anybody  yeah  and if johnny were to say this is it  you are in for a different johnny  and very fortunate because he is extremely loyal  you know he has so much to give  and has such a big heart  so obviously i think he saw something  in you and he felt safe  right i am glad  we are along for the ride whatever it is  you guys are amazing thank you  so yeah  i was very excited to see johnny  but i was really anxious  and as soon as i spoke with her  i was instantly relieved  you know he loves to be in love  and i could definitely see that with those two  how do we feel about this girl  oh she is amazing  yeah can you tell  oh my gosh yeah  we literally do not stop laughing  that is the craziest part yeah she has yeah  i can see how it is a lot of fun  i definitely see myself falling for this girl  yeah i mean she is amazing  yeah she is perfect  but my whole thing is just not being fully there yet  mm hmm  to just drop and get married  that is like a huge step for me  and i do not know if i am ready for that  but it is something i have not talked about with her yet  and i know that is something she wants so  yeah you know  make sure that whatever you do it is coming from your heart  and that it is it is a commitment  it is a big commitment  it is a huge commitment yeah  and you do not take it haphazardly  i know you will decide if now is the time  and we will support you in whatever decision you make  big decisions mm hmm  talking to my mom is amazing  she was being honest and upfront with me  and there is a lot going through my head   i love you too  it kind of just makes everything harder  when you do see yourself with this person  but you do not know if you are there in life  so it is a bunch of emotions  it is like juggling everything at once  that is a big thing to get on a knee for someone  yeah  she is an amazing person but the only thing  that is kind of stopping me right now is  stopping you from what what is stopping you  just engagement at the end mm hmm that is scary  i wanted her to meet you guys  and see how you guys felt about her  and try to just make the next step forward  i mean that is a it is a big commitment  big commitment  that is something you got to think about  but the way you guys walked in  and interacted with each other it is like  i just saw the chemistry  and i said to myself she could be the one  that is a scary thing to say itself  one of the things you say to me is like i m not ready  well how  emotionally  i think you are ready emotionally  financially  you go down the road together  and that is kind of important yeah  go with your heart i appreciate that  i mean we met her we think she is very lovely  and you have my blessing  soft music  come here i love you  my dad you know gave me great advice  he was more on the side of going for it  yeah  it was really a pleasure meeting you  it was so great meeting you  today went amazing  she fit right in  you know it gave me more affirmation that you know  she could potentially be the one  i think me and you are going to do a little cruise  gasps  show you how i live  i am falling for this girl but it is tough for me  to picture myself getting on a knee  right now with where i am at in life  and it is confusing in the best way possible   johnny has this wonderful beautiful life at home  with his friends and his family  i can definitely see myself falling in love with him  every time we spend more time together  it gets deeper and deeper and i get  these huge glimpses of what my life would be like with him  thank you for having me of course  i am glad they liked you too they really like you  it feels so good and so easy being with somebody who i know  is ready for the next step  the future is really unwritten for us  soft uplifting music   i am here in wildwood new jersey  for tyler s hometown  hometowns for me is the biggest week  because when you bring families into a relationship  it does change things  yesterday zach told me he is in love with me  and today i am really excited to see where tyler comes from  and see where this can go  oh my god oh my gosh  the jersey shore  i know the jersey shore  tyler always makes me laugh and we connect emotionally  laughs  we definitely are the most far behind  but i am excited to see if we can get there today  hi hey how are you  we are here  we are here in wildwood new jersey  today we are going to eat some food go on some rides  play some games and then obviously with the family  like there is nobody else i would rather introduce to them  i am ready you are ready  mm hmm all right  the jersey shore wildwood new jersey baby  i am in my hometown

ringing  the chances of that happening are so slim  you are the one that wanted it i got it  you got it both thank you  bell rings  ooh  both laughing  just go in the opposite way  any time i have with rachel  it s just like wow like this is incredible  oh laughs  screams i am strapped in i cannot fall  that is why they got the seat belts  if you see your life with somebody  you got to be in  and you got to give your whole self  it is not easy to open up with somebody   but i am not afraid to show my emotions  balloon pops oh  i always wanted somebody that can be emotional  that is why i am so comfortable with her  because i know that the way that i perceive love  she is the same exact way  wow  so my house is like right over the bridge  and then my apartment like during the summer  when i worked up here  yeah oh you get an apartment  i have an apartment attached like with my game  that is amazing which is like so cool  there is no other way this day could have gone any better  like showing her my world  and like her saying how beautiful it is  and i just want to be like  it s even more beautiful with you here  tender music  we have had such a great day  it is been such a good day such a great date  i am literally having the time of my life  but this is getting so serious  how are you doing hi  rachel this is joe by the way  joe this is rachel nice to meet you i am rachel  how are you  right over here you know my best friend sal  yeah  this is his dad right over here  oh hi i am good this is katie  hi katie i have heard so much about you  this is lizzie and katie s sister lauren  oh my goodness  and then this is my cousin right over here  oh my gosh she is your cousin  hi lauren i am rachel  it was great meeting his friends and seeing them  but i am feeling a little bit more apprehensive  about everything just because  there is something bigger happening tonight  you are going to get bombarded mm hmm  you are getting the whole tour  how are you buddy laughter  how are you  meeting family and friends it is so overwhelming  sal i want to introduce someone  i definitely feel like we have a strong connection  but i definitely feel like my last hometown  had a different feel going into the night  than i feel today  see you love you guys bye  nice meeting you yeah yeah  i realized my relationship with him  is a little bit farther behind  than what i would have liked to feel at this point  you just met a lot of people  i know  and now it just feels like  i am having a bit of a struggle  because meeting his family  tonight is looming a little bit  because you are meeting the fam  if my mom asks you any date that we had  i want to know which is the best moment  you have had with me  sniffles  i care about tyler so much  you ready  no no  but it really kind of hit me today that things are getting  extremely close to the end  and i just definitely feel like i have other connections  that are stronger  i have had so much fun with you you know  i do have to close up though okay  and then we will go down to the other pier  okay  i cannot believe this is all happening  i cannot believe today is real  tonight she is meeting the whole fam  and they are going to love her  i already know it  i am just so excited i am just so happy   no i just feel like sighs  i feel like a horrible person  it just is not enough time  like i do not feel like i am ready  somber music  i do not know what to do i do not know what to do   i just feel so bad because he is such a good guy  i cannot even look at him  like i am like going to like break down  he thinks we are about to sit down  and talk about his family  and that is the thing it is like  when families get involved it is huge  even just meeting his friends i m like oh my god  oh my god  sighs  i feel like i am going to throw up   i am freaking out  somber music   i feel so much pressure right now  tyler has been here for me since the beginning  shown me nothing but kindness and vulnerability  and being open  but it is hard because where i was emotionally  at my last hometown is not where i am right now  and that is why i feel guilty  sighs  it is like i feel like i am disappointing him and everyone  and not giving anyone a fair chance   sighs  today has just been incredible  yeah  like i would not have this go like any other way  and it is like playing the games and then  yeah i did not expect like everyone  to be over at the hotspot when we went there  yeah  and just like seeing you in that setting  was just incredible i know  you just taking over like lighting up the room   like that is what you do every single time  yeah  it is been better than i could ever imagine  yeah i had such an incredible day  um oh  come here chuckles  um  i guess sighs  i feel like you are just the  you are the most incredible person  you truly  i laughs nervously  i feel so lucky to know you  oh you have no like since the day that i met you  and you know i know your past and like you know mine  and you know during my like darkest like times you know  we know how hard that is  and you like just say to yourself  and i used to say to myself the time like  there s a reason for all this like just wait for it  like wait for that like reason  and like when i met you like that was my reason  like that is just every single time  that i spend with you just is better and better each time  and i am just so happy and you know  i said to you like before like how important it was  for you to meet my family and like them telling me  next person you bring here make sure it is someone  really special to you and someone  you see your entire life with  and you know at this point you know  i am not falling in love with you  i am so in love with you  and it has just been incredible  and i would not change a thing  and i am just so happy that you are here  and that i have had a chance to experience this with you  because this means so much it really does  and you are literally the most amazing person  wait wait wait i have ever met  breathes deeply  i am just   this is family you know  this is a big deal mm hmm  and right now i think i am just struggling  because i just feel like  tonight we are bringing other people into this  absolutely yeah  and i just want you to know that  i have never met anyone like you  who just loves so openly  and who just is not afraid of anything  of being hurt  and   i just feel like  we have had the most incredible day  but i am still feeling like  not confident  mm hmm  and  i do not know if  i am ready to meet your family  mm hmm  when i still have this bit of reservation  and i do not know where it is coming from  i just feel like there is something missing  and i do not know if it is time or what it is  but i just i do not know  if i am going to be able to get there with you  and hearing you say those incredible things  crying i am so sorry  no it is okay it really is  because i care about you so much  sobbing  this is so hard  i just i do not want to get to the point  where your family is involved if i do not know  i can ultimately get there with you  because i do care about you  yeah  that means a lot to me  because you know how much my family means to me  i know  i would not want to put them in that position  you know  it is not this i mean this is like  i know i am sorry it is tough no no no no  it is tough but like  being with you you make it easy  you have always made it easy  and the fact that you were able to like  let me you know love again  like that means so much to me and  listen  and i really do mean this  because i know you feel the same way  like that love that is forever  it is real it is real  and i believe in it every single day  and just looking at you i know you are going to have that  and like i want that too  i am so sorry and yeah  i do not know  i wish i could get there i do   no it is okay  i understand   you are going to find everything you deserve  i truly i know it  goodbye goodbye rachel   i feel horrible  he told me he was in love with me  like i did not even know what to say to him  because he is so incredible and i feel like  he was like comforting me  it was already hard as it is knowing that he is expecting  to go meet family after this  who thinks that they are going to know  when tyler walks in the door whether he is smitten or not  right away you will know right away  i cannot stand this waiting  i just have this feeling that he is going to walk in  with a smile from one ear to the other  i just felt so bad  someone like that they are so incredible  and i feel like why cannot i fall in love with him  he is probably head over heels for her  so excited to show her off to us  knowing what he said before he left remember  i will see yo use in a couple months  with my soon to be wife rachel  oh my god oh my god  why cannot i feel that for him  this is the hardest thing i have had to do  because i feel like my heart is breaking  today up on the boardwalk just me and like rachel  rachel let us go all cheering  we have all been waiting  we were saying how you talked about that before you left  yeah  i know i could not get there  with him but he is so incredible  and he just does not deserve this  um she is not here  she is not here why  i told her how i felt and everything  and she told me that she was not there yet  and was not ready to meet the fam  oh are you all right it is okay  yeah no it is tough it is tough it is tough  i wanted you guys to see just how happy i was  i loved her  and i still do  and all i have ever wanted is somebody that you know  would feel the same towards me  birds chirping  peaceful music   i had a great week at hometowns  with jason and johnny  i think this week i have been able  to see these men and who they are in ways  that i have not been able to see them before  and ultimately family is a huge part of that  today is my last hometown  i am in new jersey and i cannot wait to see erich  laughs  ah oh that was good  so good to see you  the last time i saw erich he told me  how much he cares for me and that he is falling for me  and honestly i can see myself falling in love with him  it is been a long couple of days  yeah yeah  i do  well i do want to see my family  i want to see if we could do that first  yeah  let us do that  let us go okay  i hope today goes well and i am nervous  because on our one on one date weeks ago  erich did open up to me  about his dad battling cancer for the last three years  and it sounds like it has not been easy for him  i do want to give you like a heads up about  my dad s situation and everything  yeah  he was legitimately supposed to die like three times  and that was like really really hard  to come to terms with  and i actually came here with him  when he was talking about like how long  he thought he had a year  and he was like i want you to take care of your mother  and that was the first time  that i like really cried from all that   that is logan  when we come back logan is going to open up  about his dramatic decision to switch bachelorettes  and all the fallout that followed  does he have any regrets  we are going to ask him that and a lot more  coming up next on the men tell all  welcome back to the men tell all  and things obviously are definitely  heating up right now  and that is because we are about to talk  about the one man who had of bachelor nation  clamoring for his dismissal  you know i am talking about hayden  he referred to the women in demeaning terms  he compared them to his ex girlfriend  he even told gabby she was quote  rough around the edges  so i am going to open it up to you guys now to discuss  yeah i think it really comes down to character  his character really showed throughout the season  you know calling someone rough around the edges  calling the girls bitches it is just one of those things  that is something that you know i would want  to address in front of a live audience  and in front of the guys  but for him not to be here  i think it speaks a lot to his character  and how cowardly he is not to be here  for a man to have to put down a woman  to feel like he is empowered is just not okay  and if this is how you are treating gabby  you do not deserve rachel either  so i am glad that they eventually got rid of him  he completely lied about the whole thing  after hearing all of that he is a misogynist  and honestly his dog rambo does not need training  he needs training  it was rude what he said it was disrespectful  and to not only put rachel through that  put gabby through that put us through that  he is putting his dog through like a lot more trauma  like taking away the dog toy  i am like bro like free rambo  like what are you doing like let him out  i mean i guess hayden and i like different girls  i guess i like girls that are rough around the edges  i love gabby she is  whee yoo  all right there is one man who did decide  to show up tonight and that is logan  obviously logan he accepted rachel s rose  he later on switched to team gabby  and i wanted to open it up to you guys  ethan what were the repercussions of that  unfortunately the group date in belgium was cancelled  it did rub me the wrong way  and getting that group date cancelled  was tough on me because that was time  that i could have used bad  logan switching we instantly knew that  okay now there s another guy  our conversations with gabby are going to be shorter now  i did not have a ton of time with gabby at that point  so i really could have used those extra minutes  those extra conversations  to strengthen my relationship with her before hometowns  i saw two wonderful people  and although i felt more moved by one connection  i thought maybe there is potential in the other one  that i had not seen or explored  at what point did you know  felt like you were just looking for the next step  that is why you accepted that rose  you went to france and you sent me home  i was not just looking for the next step  because you know what  i saw this moving connection with gabby  and so i accepted her rose  and you know if that is seen as a bitch move  you know so be it  but i thought it was worth exploring  if it means spending the rest of my life with someone  logan look i can tell that you have a lot  you want to get off your chest  want to come up in the hot seat  yeah absolutely let us have a talk  all right listen first off  i really respect you for being here  tell me if i get this right  you flirted with both gabby and rachel  you made out with both gabby and rachel  and then you joined team rachel until you did not  basically about right  in layman s terms that is sort of right  that is a lot to process  you know it is i was constantly  battling two things jesse  it was me not wanting to make these women s journey  which was already so difficult more difficult  versus me telling my truth and following my heart  and those two things unfortunately  got to a place where they conflicted  let us go back to that decisive rose ceremony  where you knew that if you accepted a rose from rachel  that meant you were going to have to commit to her  looking back after rachel gave me the rose  i would have liked to have pulled them both aside  and say i am very open  to exploring things with rachel  but i have to be honest  the connection that moved me was with gabby  well that leads me to my question  so before those roses were handed out  were you hoping for gabby s rose  or were you hoping for  like what were you hoping in that moment  i was having a heart attack i could not believe  so was yeah that this was happening   so was everybody so soon after and without me  being able to talk to them beforehand  honestly i just do not really have like the sympathy card  that i guess you are wanting right now  for me at least because you  i am not asking for anything from you  i think in your mind  you felt like rachel really was not into you  so your next thing was if i flip  i can stay longer  and that is what you did  i disagree completely jordan  there was a huge part of me that thought  when i stepped away from rachel and told gabby how i felt  that she would send me home  so it was not the easy choice  it was not jumping over because it was convenient  because it was anything but convenient  but logan i hope you do know you did mislead rachel  throughout the whole process  it was unintentional  a conversation that i was desperate to have  which would keep people from being misled  i wanted the right time and place and it did not come  and i wish i would have just had the conversation  right off the bat  bottom line now logan  when you look back on all this do you regret  leaving rachel to pursue gabby  i wish i had done it in a more graceful way  that did not affect so many people  but i do not regret pursuing gabby no  you know rachel and gabby are going to be here later  yeah  what do you want to say to them  i am sorry for making things  even more hard than they needed to be  but i hope they can just see  that my heart was in the right place  i know it was really tough for you  and listen i mean this  thank you for coming here tonight  and facing of these tough questions  yeah  thank you so much logan thank you  and if you think you have seen the last of logan  by the way you have not  you are going to see him again when a new season  of bachelor in paradise premiers on september th  right well before we go any further  i do not know about you all

toast to new adventures  cheers everyone  welcome back to the men tell all  now this next man stole america s heart  with his good looks his casual charm  and with his tireless defense of the two women  and their right to call the shots  but it was his heart wrenching breakup with gabby  that really made him a bachelor nation favorite  nate you want to come on up  have a seat  right nate i think i speak on behalf of everybody  when i say that your vulnerability your maturity  it really was impressive to watch   obviously we are going to have a lot to get to  i am going to ask you a lot i want to hear  about your time with gabby  of course we also have to address  everything that is being said on social media too  and we will get to that  but first let us take a look back at your journey  all right  oh my god my first kiss with gabby it was magical  like her lips are so soft  oh my god  i knew she was a good kisser but damn  how old are you i am  i have never met a mature man  her smile is so radiant  and her personality just makes it shine even more  there is so many levels to her that it is just beautiful  she just has a way of bringing out the best in me  and i just like who i am around her  your smile melts my heart  aww it really does  the second i laid eyes on you  i felt like i was meeting my best friend  and forever could never be long enough  to just realize how beautiful you are inside and out  aww thank you  nate makes me feel special  in a way that nobody else has here  and i was wondering throughout this whole time  how did you become so emotionally intelligent  because it is just not common for men  i have a beautiful baby girl who is six  and she is my world  like a pocket of my heart just bursted open  the first time you know she said dad or the first time  she told me she loved me the first time  like i felt her hug me  like i am a girl dad  you are going to make me cry so sweet  oh thank you please do not make me cry  oh my gosh  i have never met anyone  or dated anyone like him before  it is so heartwarming to know that men like him exist  because he really is like a true true man  gabby s just so unique and i just see  so much in her whenever i look at her  every day that i spend a second more with her  i see my potential wife in gabby  and i feel like this is meant to be  oh god i do not even know where to start  i have like such deep feelings for you  and i never want to say goodbye  but i think  i am like terrified  of not just like being a mom  but being like bad at it  i am going to miss you a lot  i do not know  i do not know if i made a mistake  just seems unfair that it is someone  who i was maybe falling in love with  you know i have never communicated  with someone so easily  you know i just felt a warmth of just being around her  being able to laugh and talk  it is is going to be a heart connection  that i do not think i will be able to replicate  you cannot just switch off emotions and feelings  i am still you know falling for her  but it is just sad that it is over  what is making you so emotional  watching that back  just to see how beautiful our journey was  it just brought up so many raw emotions  even though we broke up it was still a beautiful moment  that i got to share in time with her  so it was special to see that again  in that moment how did it feel for you  knowing that you were saying goodbye to gabby  it was one of the toughest goodbyes ever  you know when i woke up that morning  you know i was not expecting to see my name on the date card  and to go from just like a high  and not know that she was feeling  those like feelings of doubt  like i just wanted to be there for her  and let her know that it was okay  because i know that she was choosing with her heart  and i can never be mad at her for that  yeah it was heartbreaking to hear when she talked about  how fearful she was of being a mom  and she was really fearful of being a bad mom  it is so hard to hear her say those things because for me  to see so much in her being a nurturer  someone that is so compassionate and thoughtful  she just had so many facets to her  that would make her the best mom   but i empathize with her and i do not feel the need  you know  like there is no hard feelings between us  when you finally told gabby about your beautiful daughter  mila your face just lights up whenever you talk about her  how precious is that for you  having mila in my life is literally  the greatest treasure that i have  it really is  she really is my heart  to be loved by that little girl is  it is the rawest form of love that i have ever felt  and that is why i am so passionate about her  and i want my partner to have that same level of support  if she is watching tonight  what would you want to say to her  everything that i do is for you  baby girl you saved me  you did  i am a better man because of you  and i am going to try to be the best man because of you  that is really beautiful thanks for sharing that  thank you  before we move on recently now on social media  there have been some rumors circulating  surrounding some of your past relationships  and there have been some allegations  that you kept your daughter a secret  from someone you were dating for a year and a half  i went through a pretty traumatizing time  when i went through divorce  and essentially the foundation  that was built around my daughter  was pretty much crumbled  and the one thing  that i protect most on this earth  is my daughter  like i would never bring her  into a situation i feel is dangerous  a situation that i feel is unstable  and so it just made me put a wall up  protecting my daughter  from the instability of my dating life  and for clarity too we are also talking about  the fact that you were dating two women simultaneously  i would say i am deeply sorry  for the way that i acted  i should have been more communicative  i should have been more clear in my intentions  and i pray that you forgive the man that i was  because i am not that same person  there are people that are now starting to second guess  everything you said to gabby  and maybe even your feelings for her  every moment and emotion that i had with gabby was real  we both felt it we experienced it  you know in past relationships  i cannot always say that we had the commitment of  we will be boyfriend and girlfriend but with this  i committed to gabby as her boyfriend  and i walked into it with that lens  jesse i have one thing to say to nate real quick  i am so sorry yeah  i think truly great men make other men better  and nate you made me better just talking to you  being around you  you are my bro all right  so i got your back  that is really well said alec  look i know it is not easy to come here  facing these difficult questions  i also know how important it is for you  to make little mila so proud  and i think you did that here tonight  so thank you for coming nate  right make sure you stick around  we got so much more from men tell all  when we come back  welcome back to men tell all  rachel and gabby are standing by backstage  waiting to join us and i hear that they have a lot to say  to their men here  but before that we are going to take a quick trip  south of the border to check in with a few of the stars  from the upcoming season of bachelor in paradise  please give it

you both are here how does it feel to be back  how does it feel to see all the guys  it is like we never left  roby the blond hair  i love it oh my god  would you have kept me with blond hair  yes  no just kidding wow   the last time rachel was in this situation  it was not easy for her  i know this is kind of when everything hit the fan  i just want to do everything i can  on my part to make her feel special  and make her feel comfortable  but it definitely is a little bit scary  feeling this strongly towards someone  especially with other people still being involved  tino jesse what is up  how is it going man how you doing  what a pleasant surprise  dude it is been a minute since i saw you back stateside  so i just wanted to check in with you  yeah come on in you got a minute  awesome man appreciate it absolutely  i just wanted to catch up with you  like tell me where your head s at  how is everything going  the waiting game is just like gut wrenching at times  yeah every day here  when i am not getting the date card  or the invitation or whatever is  nails on a chalkboard to me  it is trying my patience beyond anything  i could have like ever imagined  and it is not going to make sense to anybody who you know  like i explain this to later on  like how much i struggled this week  except for you probably  yeah i get it  but rachel leaves me with no doubt it is worth it  so i am going to see this through  and this week s going to be awful but it is going to end amazingly  yeah no for sure i hear that  catch me up first though take me back to your hometown  how did it go on hometowns with rachel  well so my dad decided to really take an interest  and make sure he asked some tough questions and  yeah rachel walked out of it thinking he did not like her  really  and i mean i think that was hard on her  so it is horrible to think about  i had such a good time in your hometown  it went as best as it could have gone  and better than i thought it would honestly  yeah i know i talked to both my parents obviously  and they both were like she s so amazing  and i could tell that they could see me  and like how happy i was  and the energy i had around you  and that is the first thing they both said to me  when i sat down with them was like  wow you look very happy right now  and i m like yeah i am  my hopes going into it was like i just want them  to like accept me at least  and i feel like they did more than that  like i felt so welcome  that going so well has like made this so much easier too  because i know that they would accept me and it is just  and it is a good feeling absolutely you are accepted  and i think it went really well  dad and mom love you i know  naturally dad is like a little bit skeptical  but i think she was you know a little caught off guard  so is it my favorite of situations  where i am splitting time with other guys  no  like no by a million times over  and if i was not so sure  that like she is future mrs like forever for me  like this would be  a probably easy week to walk away from  yeah  i think like you meeting my family  and the reaction  and like just the whole day and night together  i am just like yeah falling in love with you  so that is why i had to say it  and i meant it  i know it is fast even for this journey  but i knew for in hindsight probably like weeks  that i felt this strongly for her  that you were falling in love with her  yeah i mean probably since bruges  wow  it is really really hard to think about her  being on an overnight  you know it is hard to be patient and wait  especially when you know  like what is going on while you are waiting  it is gutting to even think about  hope it goes great yeah  i am around if you need anything man  thanks for the chat see you later jesse  see you man  it is mind boggling to me  if like she is not sure at this point  i certainly do not need to sleep with anybody else  and i am certainly worried that my family  being so skeptical could weigh in on her decision  tonight is my first overnight  and it is a really big deal  and i definitely feel like i want  to spend tonight with aven and have  that intimate time together  i feel like it is really important  to explore your physical connection as well  and i do feel like me and aven are at that point  in our relationship where that is  the last kind of missing piece  hi  my gosh look at you   so good to see you again  how are you  i do think that aven could be the one  this is beautiful i know  wait till you see where we are eating  it was not until his hometown that i knew for sure  that i am falling in love with him  and i have been wanting to tell him  but i am so terrified because of how it went  last time with clayton  i was so blindsided by him  i was so excited for today  i had the best day with you  and cheers to a better night  cheers  i always am excited for our dates  and each time i feel like we are able to grow so much more  even if it is just like little things  mm hmm  like i mean even just kind of going back to last week  obviously it means so much to me  to be able to see myself with your family  and to see where you came from  and even just beyond that we have come so far  long way such a long way  i definitely agree  like i feel like from the beginning  from when i met you  we just take the next step every time and like you said  it just keeps getting better and better  and we continue to grow and grow  and it is been an amazing journey so far  and i really hope it continues  and yeah last week was so special to me  it just meant a lot that you know  you can potentially see yourself  a part of my family so  and you would never be in this position  if i did not genuinely see  a life outside of this with you  and that is exactly what i told your parents as well  mm hmm  and i want us to be able  to be in a place where we are on the page  so i guess going into tonight  i really do have a question  obviously we are coming up to a really big week  absolutely and moving forward  can you genuinely see yourself getting engaged in two weeks  i definitely can  i think that you know the moments that we have had  we have continued to build build and build  and i think last week you know  that was really just kind of the deciding factor for me  of knowing how ready i am for this with you  and how i feel about you  and that i am falling in love with you  and yeah i can definitely see a life with you  outside of all of this and an engagement  i feel like i am ready for it  like i came here in a really good like mental space  and prepared for that  and i did not know if i was going to  meet somebody that i felt like i could do that with  but i have mm hmm  i am ready and feel ready for it  and you have made that very easy for me  but i definitely want it to be something  that you feel as well  i want you to feel the same  yeah  i feel like everything i ask for  you really embody  i mean we started out a little bit slower  but we were able to build such a strong foundation  and i feel like from the beginning  you were always the person i was like  i feel so safe with him  and that is huge for me in a relationship  mm hmm  to feel that i can be vulnerable with you  and now i feel like we are in the place  where we not only have  that friendship and that foundation  but just this incredible romantic connection  and you are so open and you are so humble  and i think when i heard you say  that you were falling in love when we were in salem  i was nervous to say anything back to you  just because on my last journey  i feel like that word was  really carelessly thrown around  absolutely  and what that word means to me is huge  and of course i know it means the same to you  yeah  and you would never use that word  if you were not absolutely feeling it  which is why i am comfortable saying  that i am falling in love with you  oh my gosh  ah and i truly mean it  i am on cloud nine  it meant the absolute world to me  that she was able to say that she was falling  in love with me as well  i did not really have words  i was just so happy to hear  that the feeling was mutual  i have something  wow a card  i can open this and read it  mm hmm oh wow  i feel so happy  aven truly has everything i have asked for and more  please use this key to stay together as a couple  in the fantasy suite  wow i am excited  let us do it is it a yes  that is a absolute yes for me  i really believe every single thing aven says to me   and he continues to prove with his actions  over and over again that he wants to be with me  oh my god  i am so happy right now  wow  i feel like this journey is working for me  it truly does feel like he is too good to be true  ooh  oh my god my god  this is so beautiful  so beautiful  i feel so excited because i have been waiting  for this moment and it is the perfect end  to such a fairy tale day  like i just really am on cloud nine  whenever i am with aven i just fall for him more and more  and i can definitely see myself spending  the rest of my life with him  that was a good night  it was a great night  i am on cloud nine  after last night for sure  after spending the night with aven  i just really am on  kind of a different level with him right now  it is going to be hard to top  i am just running on a high right now  you are very chipper today  yeah am i chipper  yes  it is definitely really important  to explore your physical connection  and aven is the full package  the full package  cheers to an amazing night and an amazing morning  cheers  oh do we do this are we doing this  kind of slept for like minutes  and the sun was just beaming in  and i was like dang this is really nice  just waking up next to her  it felt like it felt right  it felt natural and right  i really am so excited  that we got to spend the night together  and take our relationship to a new level  i appreciate it  aven i am falling in love with you  i am falling in love with you deeper  i am very confident about where we are at  and i would love to be engaged to her  and start a relationship and start a life with her  the fact that i have now met somebody  that i feel like i can get there with is a big deal  yesterday was amazing  thank you  do not forget about me oh yeah  do not forget i am falling in love with you  do not forget that either  i am in love with you too  i will not forget  i am going to miss you  bye bye  oh my gosh this has been excruciating waiting  i have been dying to see rachel  i was ready to pull out my hair  you establish an amazing connection  and tell each other that you are falling in love  with each other and then have to wait  while other guys are trying to entertain her  but that is all fading away by the minute  because i am so excited for the date today  i really really want today to go well  rachel s seen how badly this week can go  from her previous experience and i just like  need to keep making it known  that i am the for sure thing  i do not care about the other guys  and you know the light at the end of the tunnel s  worth stomaching these challenges  today i am seeing tino  coming off the most incredible day with aven  it is hard to switch from aven to tino  i am excited but i am so nervous about today  just because last week  hometowns did not go well with his family  so i think tonight we do need to discuss the fact  that his family is really not supportive  and like how we are going to move past it  wow hi  good to see you  great to see you  how are you  it is a big day  and i know that this day has so much potential  to bring us to a whole new level of feeling  and i really hope that we can get there  i think we can  how are you doing   better now better  are you ready to go yeah i am so ready  okay let us go let us do it  how are you i am good  you look nice thank you  i am excited for you to see what we are doing  i am excited too  oh horses sweet  are you excited yeah  have you ever ridden a horse before  not in a couple years  i saw that picture of you with a cowboy hat on  in your house  perfect  hello horses aww  i have always wanted to do something like this with tino  and the horses in the jungle it is just so magical  so romantic  it is definitely a bucket list date  their little braids are so cute  i think tino is going to do great today on the horse  okay  sorry buddy i have seen thinner days  he is very athletic and he had the cowboy hat on  in one of his baby pictures  so maybe he is like real country  oh this way this way  oh  wait wait hey  oh sorry whoa  we are not going this way  come on turn around  i have not ridden a horse in a couple years  mine s a little rambunctious  you are good you are good  i am here  but we are having a great time  oh my goodness  this is a ride  so excited to be here  i am falling really fast and when i am not with her  i wish i was with her and when i am with her  i do not want to be anywhere else  ooh  oh my god you can do it rach  see you are just trying to race  attaboy  you know i had nerves coming into today  just because last week rachel met my family  which presented some unique challenges  but when we see each other for the first time  and like it starts going away exponentially  and then we are back to the middle  oh no i cannot run when i am in this top  i mean this journey s been a lot of ups and downs  but we are certainly riding an up right now  they are so in love  what do you think are you in love  wow i know  this is so cool  no way this is all ours right yes  do we get to jump in  do you want to yeah  if i slip and fall in are you going to go in after me   are you good  i had my foot caught  this is so beautiful  yeah this is amazing  i have not seen you in a while  not since our hometown  i know how have you been feeling  really good  i mean like how it ended kind of like sent me  to cloud nine and that was amazing  yeah  hearing you say you were falling in love with me  just hearing that at the end of the night was just amazing  and i am glad i got to tell you because i have  been feeling it for a while  so i was just kind of hoping that you would say something  i for sure had been feeling it for a while  i wanted to make sure the moment was just like  it did it justice  and it just could not have felt more right when i did  yeah and i think all in all like  it turned out so amazing  but yeah i mean here and there i kind of  it makes me kind of like scratch my head  because the night portion went like a little different  than i expected  mm hmm  but anything on your mind since  i just feel like i have had a lot of nerves  especially because i feel so strongly about you  and there is a little bit just of general anxiety  coming off of hometowns  and what i have been through like  no i know this week is loaded yeah  just in general this week is huge  just in so many ways  you know i am so excited  but in the back of my mind i am just like scared  like oh my god like what if  like it goes off the wall do not do that  trust me i know  i am trying so hard not to  like i am trying not to like what if myself  into like a bad place like yeah i know  this is the only thing i care about  me too  so it will be fine  rachel looks nervous  i do not know why  i mean it could be about my hometown  it could be about like my parents  asking her some pretty penetrating questions  i hope it is not about that  you know i hope we can just tackle it later tonight  and i will try to kind of peel it back  and make sure she feels as comfortable  as she always does around me  okay you count down then we go on three  one two three  can we go again yeah  okay let us do it  i feel like i have a lot of anxiety  and i think he can tell i am nervous  i really hope that tonight  we are able to have really serious conversations   about last week and what happened with his parents  and how we are going to move past it  if we do not find a way to solve the problem  i just do not think i can move forward  this is so beautiful  i am so in my head  as fun as today was i think tonight i have to have  some really serious conversations  with tino i do have actual issues  like i am scared to move forward  because of what happened at hometowns with his family  wow  that is amazing  it scares me because my one thing i wanted  out of hometowns week was just acceptance  and i did not get it  this is yet again  one of the coolest things i have ever done  look at that  how much in the back of his mind is he like  my family doesn t like her  it is hard to think that it would have no effect  on how he is thinking  thank you  can he honestly move forward with an engagement  without support  like there is kind of that urgency for me  to really get to the bottom of this  how are you feeling amazing  good today has been so amazing  it is always so fun with you  so i am just glad we get even more time together  you know i mean this week s been challenging  i mean i feel like a broken record saying that  because every second i have to wait to get  more time with you is like nails on a chalkboard to me  but like always the second we are together  that fades away and i am just so excited  and i love every second with you so cheers to that  cheers  is there anything on your mind yeah  so you said that you were like a little bit nervous  coming into today and like i just want like you to feel  so like comfortable  just telling me whatever is on your mind  if you are feeling a little nervy  or you know uncomfortable  yeah no i do not think it is like being uncomfortable  you never make me feel uncomfortable  but i think just in general  i just have felt a lot of anxiety  with just this week  and last time it just was such a rough week  i am trying to go into everything  with a really positive attitude  but i guess with that  i also have been kind of  wanting to talk about hometowns  okay and kind of what  i spoke to your parents about a little bit  mm hmm  i just feel like they really just did not like me  and it was just a really big struggle for me  i think specifically with your dad  and i got scared  oh my gosh tino s not going to want to move forward  like how are we going to get past this  how is this going to end in an engagement  when i know how much your family means to you  we have talked so much at length  you know because i am like well how is he  going to move forward when they they are just  they don t like me and i cannot convince anyone  i think the last thing your dad said to me  like one of the last things he was like  well like i m not going to disown him if he gets engaged  like i just can t accept it  and i was just like whoa really  yeah wow okay  i did not know that or like along those lines  i was like i desperately want this  like not even just approval but like okay  we do not get it but like okay  and i feel like i did not even get that  and i was like well i m worried about you  like can you get to a point at the end  where like even if you do not have their approval  you are still like  can you honestly like move forward with this  i do not feel like my dad gets me as much  in the relationship sphere  he is not it is not like you  they are really just skeptical of the situation  and i think that is understandable  probably what your parents like did the last time around  like they just cannot fathom the situation we are in  where like we do get to know each other and make each other  feel a certain way so quickly so strongly  but they know me and they know i would not be here  if i did not see you as the future  i do not want you to say this because you are like oh well  i really like want this to work  so i m just going to say that  like do you genuinely believe like  yes if let us say we got engaged  and we call them up and you are like i m engaged  that they are going to be like yes  like they are not going to be mad at you or me  they are not going to be mad at you or me   you think yes no  you are like confident  i know they are going to come around  end of story okay  it is probably not going to be overnight   and i do not expect your parents to like love me overnight  mm hmm but i see you as the future  there is just no reality here  where like they do not get on board  i see it so clearly with you  and i cannot go home without you at this point  so they are going to have to get on board with that  and they are going to love you  because eventually they are going to see  the woman that i see  and it will be impossible not to  you are so incredibly beautiful and you match that  with being ambitious being smart wanting a family  wanting you know a career and like all these things  that like i imagined in like somebody  and it took forever and going in front of the world stage  to find  and my heart s a little bit in my throat saying this  but i love you rachel  i am in love with you  i love everything like i find out about you  and i feel like it is overdue  but i am so happy to say it  i love you too  i really do  oh my god like it is been me waiting for this declaration  for so long and then of a sudden i hear it  and it feels so amazing to hear him say that  and to say it back  it is a huge moment in your life  like everyone waits for that moment  oh i get a date card  tino did tell me that if he loves me  his family will come around and i think that answer  is good enough for me  i would absolutely love to go if you want to  i would absolutely love to go  all i could do is bring up my concerns  and moving forward hopefully with how he feels  his family will also come around  they would better  because i really do see tino at the end  i feel so amazing  oh my god this is huge  what do you think  i love rachel this is the best night ever  to hear that rachel s in love with me it is indescribable  i am all about this girl i am in love with her  there is nothing else to think about  we are following the feeling and everything we do  reassures that we are right  i really love rachel  my last overnight with erich was so special  and i really can see us together  but today is my overnight date with johnny  and i am so excited  i know we are going to have a ton of fun  whoa  he really gets me in a way that i never  ever had a man get me before  so what are we going to do  we are going on a boat  a sailboat yeah  yes  i am hoping today just brings us together  and that we can see ourselves  one step closer to an engagement  have you been on one of these no i actually have not  really i used to have a hobie cat  i do not know if that is like the same thing  oh me too it is like a hamster  what  what are you talking about a boat  an animal no  today s huge i am so excited  i cannot believe that i am here with gabby  i mean every time we hang out  it kind or progresses and builds a bigger foundation  just nice being here no it is cool  just as long as you are here i am good  i do not care what we do great  it is all good  she is opened me up and made me feel confident about myself  in ways that i have never felt confident  and then you know we hit hometowns  and she met the family  i think that kind of just catapulted us further  cheers  can we cheers yeah  to us in mexico  mexico hell yeah  gabby is the dopest girl i think i have ever hung with  you have beauty you have brains you have a good time  you have like my person  it is like so crazy  i feel like we have seen so much of the world together  yes we actually have  yeah it is been wild yeah i know  like starting in la and then europe  and then your hometown and now mexico  yeah you are so easy to be with  and i feel like i can be  my most ridiculous self with you  yeah  you can be whatever you want i know  it is been moments with you so it is just been   maybe yeah i think that is  i want is just like time to spend  with you that we can truly get to know each other and um  yeah in like an intimate private way  that would be the best thing ever so  me too  tonight i do really want to do an overnight with him  i know one night can change everything  so as much as everything is working against us right now  like what if we come out on top  then like nothing could ever take us down  this is nice  i have never met anyone like him and i might not  meet anyone like him again  and i just still have to figure it out  cheers to this journey  and i am grateful for you for staying true to yourself  and i am just trying to stay true to myself too  and i think that is all we can ask from each other  cheers cheers  tonight we can truly share our feelings with each other  and then who knows what can happen like the next day  and how things might change  no i know it like has not been easy for you  but we owe it to ourselves to try and see it through  as much as we can  a future with jason would be full of surprises  he is so sensitive he is so warm  i could tell just by the way he looks at me  that he really cares about me  he is especially guarded  but days and nights feel like years here  one conversation with jason really  could change everything  waking up i am hurt and i am devastated  last night with jason  once we got behind closed doors  we were talking in circles and could not agree  on like how things were going to go  and if we needed more time  and honestly i was like running out of patience  i was like maybe it s just not meant to be  and then he was like yeah definitely  like when were you going to tell me that  so you know i wanted to leave  and give it space  right before i walked out the door  he was like basically like this is it  and as much as it hurts  i know that i need to say goodbye to jason  you know i am ready for somebody to love me  the way that i love them  hi  hi  um i think overall  just like waking up this morning  i think my mind s just kind of spinning  like really like what we were doing  i guess all of these weeks  because you were willing to be here and participate  so i took that as like you did at least  see it going somewhere week after week  but then last night it was like you are questioning  you know if this is real and like you cannot  see me in the outside world  um yeah  it was yeah incredibly tough for me  and i truly needed that time for me to realize like  this was not going to work for us  um yeah i am sorry  i genuinely want the best for you   and think you are an amazing person but i i i am  i am really sorry  you like you honestly like do not have to apologize  or say things like you think i am an amazing person  because it does not like  like lessen the blow i guess  i want to be with someone and with someone  who is ready to be with me and no questions asked  and that is not us  so like you do not have to say sorry  okay i get it  yeah i do not know  i was just trying fighting for it  and trying to like see  i do not know if like you were really fighting though  i think i was and you were like following my lead  it is like i think you are like so terrified to hurt me  you have been treading so lightly  but it is like you knew how you feel  and like could not tell me  and i am sorry like that it happened like that  but i got that clarity when we were up there  it is okay you do not like really  i am not looking for you to apologize  like i truly just want you to realize  you know i have been led on yeah  so but um  yeah i i do not think i have really anything else  left to say  i think that is it yeah  yeah okay  it is like i feel so stupid  i thought i knew him but like i really do not  i have tried so hard to not be reckless with other people  and he was reckless with me  he never loved me  so what were we doing  it is not even that he did not want an engagement  he did not want me  how do you just keep trusting  johnny also does not want me  is it me  i just do not know what it is about me  that is so hard to love  i am terrified  like what if erich decides i am not for him  i too broken for anyone to love  it does take the right person  to know how to love me  and they might not be here  it feels really exciting to be  at this point in my journey  so far my overnight week has been a dream  it is so gorgeous here in mexico  and i am so close to an engagement  it is incredible  having this uninterrupted time is just really huge for me  to gain clarity on who i want to spend  the rest of my life with  there was aven   who was my first overnight of this week  i think it went so well  it was a good night it was a great night  i am falling in love with you  i am falling in love with you deeper  we were really able to get to know each other deeper  and see that we have a great connection  this is so rad  and then my next overnight with tino was so perfect  my heart s a little bit in my throat saying this  but i love you rachel  i love you too  i really do  felt so amazing to hear him say he is in love with me  and to say it back  i am excited to have my last overnight date  with zach today  we had such a great hometown  he told me he was in love with me  and i am falling in love with him too  so i am a little bit freaked out  because i have three incredible guys  and in ten days there is going to be one  hi  hello how are you doing  so hopefully i can put my nerves aside today  and have an amazing day with zach  you look beautiful how are you  how are you oh  hi good to see you  good to see you  welcome to puerto morelos  this is my first time in mexico  we are going to have a really fun day on the town and explore  what do you say i cannot wait  let us do it you ready  let us do it  zach is everything that i want  in a partner  i do not even have a question  would zach get down on one knee  or is zach ready  because i know he is  we are going to go in here interesting  the last time i saw zach was in anaheim for his hometown  and i definitely see myself  being a part of his family for sure  cheers cheers  because of all the families  his family was honestly the most welcoming  you have to drink all  yes fill the tequila okay  okay you have to kiss the tequila  kiss it just a little  just a little yes  so good  very good  thank you thank you  it is a pleasure  that is dangerous oh yeah  so you got to meet with my dad talk about planes  mm hmm we had the best time  i feel like i fit in perfectly in this family  you are welcome that was a fun day  you survived it you know  and your house is so beautiful  thank you  truly your backyard is like my dream backyard  it was you know like the summer go to hangout spot  i was going to say your house had to be  i imagine your mom had to make so many meals for all  of your friends growing up so many  so many pizzas that have been ordered  my dad just at the grill yeah  your mom seems like oh my gosh  just she is such an angel  so sweet  and like the way she talks about your dad  they talk about each other the exact same way  they are very much still in love like the day they met  aw i love that  they just went on like a however long  road trip together and my mom said  you know me and your father  just were on a day road trip  in an rv and we didn t fight once  and she s like we ve been married for almost years  and i was like that s what i m looking for  my parents have been fighting the whole time  no well not fighting  but they like the way they communicate  is by like raising their voice  gotcha i do not think i have ever raised my voice  no one in my family raises voices  oh  i do not think i have ever raised my voice  ever in an argument really  you have such a like striking voice  booming booming yeah  can you try to speak in a high pitch voice  is this high enough for you  that was the worst thing i ever heard  is not it  when i am with rachel everything is  just so bright and fun and easy  and that is a pretty great feeling  oh hot  it is kind of coastal grandma  we have you know no like rhyme or reason  for anything we do or say  because we just get each other  ooh that could be us  could be a dead couple  we are just doing fun stuff which is  kind of how i operate  what is that one ooh that is a big one  you can eat it you want to try  what kind of a bug is that  grasshopper  we have to eat the bug  here i got you  mmm  i mean there is no way it is these are good luck  it tastes like a chip  ooh mmm  i am having an amazing time with rachel today  i mean everything you could ever ask for in mexico  we are doing it  and now you are going to buy me a ring  i am feeling confident that the love  has just been growing  oh oh oh  and that she can without a doubt  see a future with me as a spouse  because i am feeling it and i think she is feeling it  but on the flip side   hmm  the thought does constantly creep up  like oh you know there is other relationships  you know being formed here  that is not a fun and easy thought  hmm  the reading was saying that  i am worried about the past  and to not worry about the past  because the future is positive  and i feel like i have definitely been worrying about the past  because of what happened  when i was in this position last time  the day clayton told me to go home  i was just so heartbroken and so blindsided  and now i am in a position where someone can get hurt  i love mariachi  zach has kind of been killing it today  we have a great time every single time we are together  and the relationship between zach and i is really powerful  and he loves me and wants to take care of me  but with tino and aven i also have  such an incredible connection so i am just struggling  it is like a lot harder than i ever thought  and i think people cannot even begin to understand  how much stress i am under  because how do i even get to a point emotionally  where i can break up with any of these men  who are the most incredible men i have ever met  i am very confused right now  is not this tree so pretty  this is so nice i know  and it is breezy i know  we kind of match too  yeah got some style  after today s date and during today s date  from what i could tell from rachel  i like to think i am the one  that is going to be here at the end  you know proposing to her  and i am feeling more than excited  wow it is so beautiful  with fantasy suites tonight is just another opportunity  to build on the relationship that we have  where there are no cameras and it is private  and we can talk about everything and anything  i already see a future  because i love this woman and i want to be with her  for the rest of my life  cheers to all the memories  you and i have shared to this point  mm hmm that is the fun  the laughter and the dancing to mariachi music  so cheers to many more to come  cheers  not to mariachi  i truly had no idea how to dance to that  i do not even know if there is a way to  exactly  and then what did you think about the psychic  that is right  the tarot card reader yeah  well that was the first time i have  ever done something like that mm hmm  what did you feel about it i like what it said  i do not know what did you think  well i actually wanted to like talk to you about that  i do not know if today you noticed  i was a little bit off  i hope you did not  but what she said was there was a lot of like fear of the past  and a lot of like challenges  and like right now i really feel like that is true  yeah  i have struggled with the feelings i felt last time  being like almost bleeding into this week  and kind of tainting this week  mm hmm  no matter how happy and how excited i am  especially to have you here and to be doing all this  i think i do have those fears of like still failure  and being blindsided and leaving here alone  because this is the point in my own journey  where things started to go really bad  so like i am really just trying my best to remember  like she said that this is not the past  like the psychic she literally said  she is like this isn t the past  this is like kind of a new journey  and this is your future  and you obviously make me feel so safe  and i am so thankful that you are here because you know  i do see a future with you  well i want you to know that you know  you you did not show it but it is okay if you did  because i could not imagine you know  what you were going through last year  with what clayton had done  and that was obviously the worst thing a man can do  and i just want you to know that i do not want to  ever put you in an uncomfortable position  i know you are feeling a lot of anxiety from you know  the past and this and i do not want to make that  you know heightened  i want to be there for you  i want to just enjoy this time with you   because i have these incredibly strong feelings for you  i am in love with you  and going into a night like this  where you know what is to come is what excites me  obviously we all know how things went down  with clayton last season  and the last thing i would ever want  is for the woman i love and care for  to feel like she is not being watched out for and protected  and so i want her to know that she can always be  you know safe with me  i have something for you oh  do you want to read it  i would love to  rachel and zach i hope you enjoyed your day  in puerto morelos  what could be better than a little tequila  and a glimpse into your future  and by the way you better have brought  some of that tequila back for me  should you choose to forgo your individual rooms  please use this key to spend the night together  in the fantasy suite jesse  and here is the key  yeah  so what do you think  i think i would love the opportunity  to spend the fantasy suite with you tonight  let us do it  i think after today s date i am more than confident  rachel and i s future only looks bright  it was incredible  so tonight will be the night  rachel and i will have answers  wow oh my gosh  is not this so pretty wow  i am in love with his woman  and i want tonight to be where we can talk  about the really important stuff  gosh what a room  this is so beautiful  in the morning i am expecting to feel  more in love with future mrs shallcross  and nothing coming out of tonight can change that  do you put limes on fruit  they have some limes i think so  or should we just eat the lime  do you want that oh what is that yogurt  i think  do you want to drink it  it is good for you  cheers pretty strong  cheers  ah  that is some good some good cup of joe right there  do you think it is good  yeah  really i mean it is kind of bitter  i love it when you can just taste the beans  like you just chewed them up  i am ready for bed i am like so tired  we did not sleep right we went to bed so late  so late  i mean we did have a big night  mm hmm  we talked about a lot of things  yeah  it was like a tough conversation but  mm hmm  i am glad you handled it well  and hopefully it helped you know gain clarity  gain clarity  clarity  you are feeling okay honestly  it is a lot to digest yeah for sure  because we did cover a lot and you know  a proposal is right around the corner  for sure you know  but you know  i am here for a reason and  you know you are that reason so  so i hope we are on the same page  i think we are okay  i think we are  waking up this morning  i am feeling a little confused  after last night  fantasy suite night with rachel  was not the night i expected  initially in the fantasy suite you know  i was feeling so sure  we are having this amazing time and we are one step closer  to engagement and we are having that important conversation  about religion politics of that stuff  and rachel brought up her fear that   okay  yeah  so obviously i told them  everything i felt and like  they are so happy to see me so  happy  i guess like i am like  a little bit concerned  because they expressed to me  that may be you might not be  ready for an engagement  yeah so it is not about not  being ready  and i want you to know that  nothing has changed in terms of  how i feel about you  i am falling in love with you  and i see a life with you  after this  and i want to get to that point  with you so much  like i just i just want to  make sure that it is right  for both of us right now  and in this very moment in time  yeah i am just like very  confused i guess because  like for me like we talked  about like engagement and  after this and like you know  this is what i want so like  you do not feel like you are ready  to get engaged  i do feel like i am ready to  get engaged  i just want to make sure that  it is right  i am so confused  that is not what you told me  i  i stressed to them i want  nothing more than to be with you  after this  i know that there is still  somebody involved in this  that is another thing  okay but aven  this is about us  i know  but rachel this is like both  of our lives  this is a very big deal  i know and i am being  serious  i know you are  i know you are  is it like crazy for me to  think that like we are getting  to that point and i am just  trying to make sure  it is not crazy but we talked  about this  why am i telling everyone in  there i m serious and  you are like i m not ready to  get engaged  so like why is that happening  you understand where i am coming  from  i do  like this is like hard for  me because i see you at the end  of this  like that is hard for me to  hear  i do not understand why they  are sitting there being like i  do not think he is ready to get  engaged  like where is that coming from  it is not coming from anything  that has to do with where i am at  with you  i see us in the end of this too  rachel  i do  i am trying to make sure that the  engagement is the best thing for  both of us  my feeling towards you have not  changed at all  at all  i know but like but aven  this is like i wanted you  i know how i feel about you  and like i wanted you to walk  in there and like be like   like i do not like people coming  up to me and being like  rachel i don t know  like that is hard for me  do you understand that  like i wanted everyone in there  to be confident  like you have to understand  where this is coming from  i understand where it is  coming from  like i was so  i am trying  i am trying not i am trying to  just be as open with you about  this  i want to talk about this  i am listening to you  and i am sorry if i am coming  off strong right now  i am not trying to  i just really care about you and  i care about us  this is a big deal  like like i have no doubt in  my mind about us getting there  whether it is in a few days  or whatever the case may be  rachel  i just want to be with you  and i am sorry if what they said  you came off differently  but what if what i want is to  get engaged  if that is what you want  then  but i am not going to force  you into something that you  do not want  it is not about not  wanting it  i am just telling you  where i am at  like i am trying to be honest  with you  and tell you where i am at  and how i feel about you  why are you shaking your head  at me  because i am just like  so confused  like  oh my goodness  everything we have done to this  point has made me feel the way i  feel about you  i am falling in love with you  i am not going to sit here and  throw words around in your face  because it makes you happy  i am going to be honest with you  i know but you told me  that is only fair to you  that is what you told me  what are you talking about  you told me you were ready  for an engagement  i am ready  but why are they saying that  you said you were not  because i want to make sure  that the timing of it is right  rachel  why are you yelling at me  i am sorry  i am not trying to yell  i am just very i am trying  i am very passionate  i am sorry  i am not trying to yell at you  i wanted was for us to go  into this on the same page  so now why do i feel like you  just did not tell me what page  you were on  i did not get the chance to  talk to you after last week  after overnights you changed  your mind  no did not  oh my gosh  i did not change my mind about  anything  you need to understand also  like i want someone who can sit  in front of my family and be  like this is  i m so confident  like the fact that you are  like i don t know  that is like hard for me  i am not inconfident in us  at all   i want you in the end of this  i just want to make sure that  engagement is the right thing  for both of us at this time  mutually okay  i promise you  and i am sorry  i do not want to ever see you  upset especially if it is like  like me making you upset  like i cannot  i do not want that at all  yeah  ready  yeah  i really do not want to end this  on a bad note  it is not a bad note  i understand  i just need you  to understand me too  i know and that is  i know  i understand  i am just trying to be honest  with you  and i know you are  everything we are doing is  obviously adding to this  i know  and i know you are being honest  it is not a bad note  okay  i will see you soon  okay  i am sorry  i had a really grat  conversation with all of them  i love all of them  and i came in here trying to be  myself and be real and be honest  and consider your feelings  in all of this  and i am here for you okay  i am  i want to be with you  i need you to know that before i  walk away from here  okay  okay  are you okay  i am okay  promise  mm hmm  i will see you later  see you  okay  yeah  i just feel shook up  at this point i just really am  like not sure how aven and i  move forward from it  i just feel really confused  and blindsided  like how am i supposed to have  confidence in anything anyone  says to me  like how am i supposed to trust  anyone  everyone is lying to me  is it better just to leave by  myself  like what am i supposed to do  welcome back to the two night  live finale of  the bachelorette  gabby and rachel are here  watching along with our studio  audience and the rest of  america  all i have got to say i feel like  everyone here honestly is a  little bit shocked by what they  just saw because i do not think  anyone really expected aven to  ever question getting engaged  rachel watch your face in the  video and you were talking to  aven i think it says it all  what was going through your mind  when aven was expressing his  trepidation with a proposal  i think for me it was just  really hard because i did walk  in so confident  it is a kind of get hit with  that it was just really tough  for me  you thought you were on the  same page  gabby can you help people at  home understand just how intense  are those conversations you are  having about commitment  you know that a proposal it  might be days away  i think these conversations  are make or break and it does  seem like the end date somehow  speeds up then you have to weigh  what you are going through  that is when things catch up to  you  you have to be honest with  yourself and know what you want  which i think that is what rachel  did  even with aven s hesitations  at that point you still wanted  to move forward  how come  i mean i just really was  hoping this was something we  could get past that we could  kind of get back on the same  page  that is what i was hoping for  you were not the only one  having family in mexico  gabby it is erich s turn to  meet your family and your  beloved grandpa  it is going to be the second time  that he meets john  that is right  a double dose of grandpa john  a double shot  how is it going to go  let us take a look  ready to see gabby  i know  yeah  it is hard when you cannot really  hear from her  well my guess is she found  her perfect person  there is our girl  hey shrimp   oh my gosh grandpa  you look so nice  what does that mean  i do not always look nice  i love my family so so much  and i am so grateful that they  are here  i am just excited just honestly  to be in their presence and to  give them all a hug  it is so good to see you all  thank you so much for coming  they love me unconditionally  which is the best kind of love  it is like a safe love  so we have to hear how many  how many what  how many suitors do you have  left  so erich is the only one that  i want you guys to meet  i know erich  he is a  but that is all right  i love him anyhow  yeah  grandpa came on a date and the  one that he came on was erich  i really liked him a lot  well i did tell him i loved  him  oh  we were going to ask that  i know  i mean  well he is a likable guy  i am sure if you said it  you meant it  yeah  good for you  so proud of you  yeah  so i am going to go get him  okay  i will be right back  i did not think this day would  ever come  i did not think my family  would ever really be meeting a  potential husband  hi  so for me kind of coming in and  telling them today that erich is  the person that i want to be  with now and forever  feels so crazy  hi  this is erich  hi how are you  how is it going  hi this is my aunt julie  yes hi  i know you  how are you  are you doing any bowling  between your legs anymore  no  i did not get any better  how is it going  nice to meet you  nice to meet you erich  i want them to accept erich  and i want erich to accept them  in a way that he can see a life  with me and with them  so how was your hometown  my hometown was amazing  like i knew going into that  like i really wanted gabby to  meet my parents  and they were just like  obsessed with her  really  oh  the most approval and  validation you could ever get  is like the people that mean  the most to you  absolutely absolutely  so after that i was pretty  convinced that you know i was  falling in love with her and i  wanted to take that night to  just be like this was a really  beautiful and special day for me  and you know i am falling in  love with you  i needed to tell her because i  do not want to walk out of here  just not being honest  and true to this  i do not want to walk out of here  with any regrets  i told him earlier you know  with everything we have been  through and how i feel about you  and how much you mean to me and  stuff  but hearing you say it to them  obviously means the world  so cheers  i will drink to that  i think gabby is definitely  in love  i mean she said it  she looks it  you can tell just from the gleam  in her face that she possibly  has found the person she will  spend the rest of her life with  and i think he would fit in  perfectly because we are a fun  family  we do enjoy each other s  company  we like being together  we are very close  what do you think  i like erich  he is a keeper  yeah he is  more important what do you  think about him  he is been like nothing but  really really good to me  him even being with the family  and being able to say how he  felt about me like was not  expecting him to do that  i hope he would not do that  unless he wanted to  i am sure i am sure he  would not say it without meaning  it  yeah  so i think he is sincere about  it  your grandma would be tickled  pink  i really wish she could have  been here for this  me too  she would have loved it  i know  and she would have given you  the same advice i am giving you  it is got to be  not just  yeah  okay  right sweetheart  i love you  i love you i love you  i love you  you take care  i love you too  i just get emotional  i am sorry  oh grandpa  that is okay  right  i mean i am so grateful for  you guys and  me too  i know  i wish  i am grateful to have a dang  bad beautiful granddaughter  talking to my grandpa is  always like a breath of fresh  air  you know he did get really  emotional with me today and  hearing that i am loved from my  grandpa and having him give it  to me so freely honestly means  everything  it is nice to finally meet you  after that introduction  holy cow gabby seems pretty  excited  how do you feel  obviouly you expressed a little  bit already  why do you know i guess that  gabby is the right person  if you really feel that way  like we had this crazy  connection from the beginning  and i was honestly intimidated  by her  because she was like making a  lot of jokes and picking points  of my insecurities  i was like okay this is  like  but what i did not realize was  that i was going to fall for  your daughter and i am obsessed  with her  i think she is an amazing person   and i cannot imagine my life  without her at this point  wow  that makes us happy  yeah that does  yeah  we just like the fact that  she goes well i could have  brought these other people  but why when i know who i  want  she is very certain for the  first time in her life  we are kind of guarded over  her heart so we do not want her  to get hurt  no  exactly  just because of what she is gone  through you know with myself  and her mom early on  she is been through a lot  i think she needs somebody to  validate that she is worthy of a  good relationship  yeah  you know  because she is  gabby s been through a lot  and she really does want to find  love  i like erich a lot and we all  want gabby to finally settle  down at some point in time  so it would be good if she does  you have never come home with  somebody where you said this is  him  i mean why are you so sure  how do you know that a couple  weeks from now you are not going  to be like yeah that was  good  but what is different  i think that is i have almost  been at odds with myself with  him a little bit because i think  it was some of the too good to  be true  i cannot believe like i have kind  of met someone like erich  he just loves me in a way that i  really have not had before  that i know i need  you deserve it  yeah  you do  you have been through a lot  yeah  i do really think we can last  a long time  which i think is why i get so  emotional  yeah  you just need to trust  yourself  yeah  do not doubt yourself  yeah  which is hard i mean it is a  battle every day even coming  today i m like is he still  here  but i think when something is  that good you are afraid to lose  it  right  so that is how i am with him  i love erich more than i ever  thought i could really love  someone  i get emotional thinking about  my dad talking to him  breathe okay  you are okay  just take a minute  because it is like i do not  know if he ever thought he would  have these conversations with  anyone  of this exacerbates  you know not having like  really felt love from mom  and stuff  i know  i hate that for you  i know but  that sucks  it is okay  no it is really not okay  you know it is not  and you should not have had to go  through that  i am really sorry that you did  i do not know if it will  like send a message to erich  that i am like unlovable  it is like how it makes me  feel  i get it  i get it  but promise me something  do not hide this from erich  if you truly feel like erich is  the one for you let him be the  one to understand you  you have to communicate  and you have to let him see you  vulnerable and see you at your  worst and understand why you  are  because of the that  you have gone through  let him see you for all that you  are  yeah  having my aunt here today really  helped guide me through  everything because i was feeling  a lot of emotions  i mean i do not take anything  lightly  good to meet you  yeah  she let me know it is okay to  be who i am with erich and  that is why he is here is because  he is always accepted every part  of me  okay i will see you soon  good  see you really soon  really soon  do not do anything fun  without me  i will try not to  bye  i am just so excited  for gabby  because she just so deserves to  find love  you are going to make me cry  now  i just love her  i want the best for her  tired of dating married guys  who drive around in a creepy  old van  we can do better  apply to be on next season  of the bachelor  go to abc com casting now  welcome back to the emotional  live finale of  the bachelorette  i am here with gabby and rachel  and so far something of a mixed  bag in the meet the family  department  would you both agree  definitely a mixed bag  ups and downs  i will say it is good to see big  tony and grandpa john again  we are going to see them next  week with a twite finale and i am   sure they are going to have a lot  of opinions  there is a lot of chatter about  grandpa john for bachelor  people love grandpa john  watch out ladies  he is coming in hot  rachel you are back up because  it is time for tino to meet your  family  let us see how tino does  today tino is meeting my  family and i am trying to be  happy  but like yesterday just was so  shocking  i just am really disappointed in  aven and i am like so sad  about it right now  like i am happy about tino but  now i am like obviously nervous  that tino also is not ready for  an engagement  hi  hello  you look so pretty  thank you  you guys look so great  i really just hope me and  tino are on the same page still  and that he impresses my friends  and family  they see something i do not see  then i do not know what i am going  to do  how was your night  well i will be honest  i feel like today is just one of  those days where i am just like  not in the best mood  i really felt like me and aven  were on the same page so it is  just not how i wanted it to go  i wanted him to walk in and for  you all to be like this is  it  so you can understand it is a  little frustrating  now today i am like okay what s  going to happen  what s going to go wrong  but i really am excited for you  guys to meet tino  he got my first impression rose  and i fell for tino really  early  but tino s family does not like  me really  why  did they not understand you  or like you or was it the  process  what was the hesitation  i do not know  i think this just was not  something that they expected  is it your interpretation  that they do not like you  or what happened  we can ask him  he is also a grown adult and  if like this is his decision  i am sure they are going to like  eventually come around  but i think i am going to go get  him  so i will be right back  i am really excited  rachel came and not as  excited not gushing like she  was the first time you know  yesterday  i think she is worried that  there is going to be another  issue that we are going to find  and she is going to be  disappointed again  hi  hi beautiful  you look great  how are you doing  so much better  now that i am with you  i miss you too  how are you doing  let us sit  yeah  do you feel sweaty today  no surprisingly  so let us not jinx it  are you nervous  i am a little bit nervous  yeah  you know i just i want them  to get excited about us as much  as i am  yeah me too  okay come on  hi  hello  this is tino  how are you doing  nice to meet you sir  today i am meeting rachel s  famly and friends  and there is a ton on the line  i really really want pretty  much need their approval  because like that is like  something that is really  important to her  so do you want to tell them  about our story  yeah so i rode in on a  forklift  probably this is the most  nervous i have been since  but so you know we uh we  kind of like caught each other s  eye really early  what is the most special  moment that you two have shared  so far  i think our dinner our last  dinner when you were able to be  really honest with me and you  told me  oh yeah  you were in love with me  yeah  i am in love with her and i cannot  wait till you guys all get to  know me a little bit better  us too  me too  when he first walked through  the door he looked nervous  i could tell he looked nervous  tino i would love to talk to  you  all right let us do it  let us go  but after the conversation  with aven yesterday i thought  it was very important for me to  ask where he stands  let us just hope there is no  surprises  do you think you guys have  enough in common  yeah  i mean do you have a lot to  do together  yeah i mean like i do not  expect her to go surf with me  but yeah the fun thing will be  we will pick up things together  did you ever bring a girl  home before  yeah i mean a couple met  them but it was like  because i know that means a  lot to her to have family  especially who likes her  do you think your family would  be coming more understanding  about it  absolutely   i am a million percent confident  they will love rachel  because i do  so they do not have a choice  no  i know  and that is all that matters but  i do know family does make a  difference  it can cause problems in the  future too if family does not  like somebody  so if you are confident  rachel wants the other family to  like her too  you know if families like each  other it is going to make the  marriage better  and he knows his dad  if he thinks his dad s going to  accept her then i feel better  he is successful loves what  he does  does he build townhomes or  does he build skyscrapers  yeah that is what he does  large buildings go for years  and you cannot work remote when  you are building a building  right i am just thinking about  you  and your dreams  so if you want to work in  europe  yeah i mean definitely  but it is not like i need to do  that right now if it does not  work out he wants to travel  he lives a very interesting  life from what you told us  and that is got to be exciting  and i know that is the way you  live life  yeah he has these crazy  hobbies and he wants to do all  these things and it makes me  like well i want to be a part  of that and i want to do that  charity work with you and i  would love to learn how to surf  and live in that beach town with  you  you have got to have fun in  life  life goes really quick  yeah  i am excited for you  to talk to him  i am excited to speak with him  also  when she described tino  she described him with such  enthusiasm  and i am excited to see my  daughter that happy  but i am a father  i am not looking for what is  happening tomorrow  i am more concerned to see what  their future is going to be  how are you doing today  i am doing pretty good  you know let us get right at it  tell me a little bit about the  hometown  what happened there that changed  her mind or  made her feel uncomfortable  yeah i hope she did not  change her mind  so hometown was a little  surprising to me too  to be honest with you all i  talk about with my dad is  sports  so it was really shocking  but i am sure that if they  get a day with her where we go  to the beach they will like  fall in love with her just like  i did  she will have a job that she  could live in california and be  working out of atlanta  but you are not as mobile  as she is  is that going to be a problem  if she wanted to go i do not  know like to a foreign country  i would just say okay we need  at least a couple years so i can  be on the building  good  because you know she is that  adventurous type and she  explained about you being the  same type of person  in the most genuine way i can  put it i mean your daughter  does mean the world to me  life is hard but i want to be  that person who is sharing that  burden with her and there to  experience the amazingness that  we bring to each other  i am going to make your daughter  happy forever  well i do like you  i do like you  i am a little bit in awe of  how well meeting rachel s family  just went  seriously thank you guys  so much  i am kind of really feeling like  what i have wanted for weeks now  is really going to happen  nice meeting you  absolutely  so nice meeting you  bye guys  today went better than i  thought it could have went  big stamp of approval from  everyone  now we just have to work  on your family  they will like you  you have already got the approval  the important one  and the rest will follow soon  and i really do feel like he  does want a life with me but i  do not know how to like think  about what is going to happen  next  bye  because i still have to have a  discussion with aven  he is someone i really care about  too and i know he probably is not  feeling good right now  i think he is probably like  waiting until he gets a chance  to explai things to me again  and this really hard  conversation has to happen  so yeah i just have to take it  one step at a time right now  we are back  we are live  and you are watching the highly  charged bachelorette finale  twitter right now is on fire  some folks are team rachel  so martin aven  summer team gabby and everyone  is team grandpa john  i am not sure if grandpa john ',\n",
       " ' so i am really curious to see what he has for me  i mean it is incredible that you went on that  journey you did and now you are back like running it back  i know it is i think that is incredible  crazy to be here  how do you feel are you nervous  yeah i mean i totally was you know like driving up  i actually did feel a little bit more at home on that  because i am a general contractor so  okay yeah so like i mean  that actually did feel pretty comfortable  i was like all right cool this is kind of like normal  every day you are on the forklift  no no  like i get excited every time i get to go on it  it is that rare  you needed the helmet so getting to do it  in this situation yeah i mean  i mean there is some creative entrances  yours was one of my favorite i really liked it  really yeah  i appreciate the driving skills  well i came to make you laugh  so i am glad i can well it is perfect  you are off to a great start you took me to the stairs  would you let me kiss you  yes we can go on the cheek  if you want  the stairs are already getting better  yeah i was just going to say  you better smile when you see stairs now  because i know i am going to  already better  can we just stay on these stairs then  i am so happy to finally get a kiss tonight  tino is definitely the romantic connection  that i have been hoping to have  and it is what i have been waiting for  i feel better than ever about finding my future partner  i cannot wait to see how the rest of the night goes  what a night  i know  how is it going  oh my god it was so good  do you think they are watching right now  yeah  how many people have you talked to you  okay tell me tell me tell me  mario i really like  i feel like we had a really good conversation  he was like so nervous it was cute  oh my gosh  and i talked to jacob  yeah how was that  we were laying on a fur rug  by the fireplace with him shirtless  how about you i talked to hayden  and he made me a birthday card oh my god  because my birthday was two weeks ago  it was so sweet oh that is so sweet  and then i talked to jordan the race car driver  okay he surprised me  oh good  yeah and then i talked to tino  how was that  we kissed  have you kissed anyone i kissed mario  they are all so different  i know it is so true  and you like are attracted to different  qualities in each person  it is like different being with them  separately than it was when they were like  introducing themselves to us both  yeah yeah  now i kind of understand how you can  have feelings for multiple people  are you saying you are falling in love with three women  i am in love with everybody  i m in love and it feels so good  yeah  i think tonight is going really well  these guys have already made such good impressions  so i am really excited to see how the rest  of tonight goes and see what happens  my man my man  gentlemen how are we doing  how are we doing  a little something for gabby and rachel  i will put it right there enjoy the rest of your evening  see you guys all right  my man jesse  oh there is two yay there is two  two is better than one you know  makes it a little more real  makes it a lot more real  that thing s staring me right in the face you know  i think hearts kind of drop a little bit you know  go into the stomach i know for me it did  if you do not make an impression  you know those two roses or any rose  might not be yours and you might be going home so  you know i think it made it real for everybody  the clock is ticking so many guys  you have to be a little cocky in this situation  you have to kind of get yourself out there  got to get in there yeah  yeah yeah yeah  should we have our whole conversation like this  it would make it a lot easier for me  i would be a lot less nervous if we did  i am going for it i am going for gabby  you know what i am saying  i am going to try to talk to rachel right now  putting your flag in early  i think the first impression rose is everything  i think that would really set the tone  for the rest of our journey  i am nervous my heart you got to feel  it is pounding out of my chest  you should have more to drink  yeah i should  obviously at some point  they are going to end up liking the same person  it is going to happen with guys  and then how is that going to work  it could be awkward they could get in a fight  you never know  like it is interesting to think about  pressure is mounting a little bit just to get  that conversation i am not going to lie  i would love the first impression rose  i am going to try and get time with gabby and rachel  i think i would rather talk to the real chicks  rather than continue to talk to these two  the bird just pooped in my hand  so i wanted to get something out of the way  okay  i am dying to know your biggest fear  my biggest fear your biggest fear  okay on three ready   yeah i am going to say mine too  okay one two three  clowns sharks  clowns sharks  okay i have heard there was like  a couple clowns like during the entrances today  so were you just terrified out of your mind  wait you are smooth that was a good one  i am very attracted to logan  he made me laugh  i think we are both very spontaneous  this is my first time really out in california  yeah but i have always kind of wanted  to see the pacific northwest as well washington  seattle yeah  you busy in the next couple weeks  i do not know you think we can make time  maybe  i think maybe we could like figure something out  i was really happy the way it went with rachel  it felt like we had a real connection  but navigating two bachelorettes  this is a really difficult process  i will see you inside absolutely  i need more to go off of before i can make  a decision on who i want to pursue  did you speak with both no gosh  if i spoke with both that would be pretty impressive  i do not think anybody has  how are you tonight i am good how are you  i am doing so well  where are your chicks  the chicks did you ditch them for me  they had a little too much to drink  i had to call them a cab home  i still have a lot to like learn about you  yeah but you seem so fun  oh thank you  like when shanae got kicked out of the house  and you just double bottled up  yeah i am like  that is my hidden talent yeah  okay so are you the type of person who goes into a movie  and buys candy at the concessions stand  oh  or do you bring like a trench coat  right and like stuff everything  in the pockets and kind of sneak in  yeah the trench coat the trench coat  like a whole sandwich god i am so relieved  yeah logan s great  he is super endearing  i feel like we have similar senses of humor  i will put corn dogs in there  yeah like burritos  full totally like hot dinner food  i am excited to see where things go  we did have so much fun and he is somebody  that i have my eye on for the future  what are you looking forward to most  i am looking forward for it to be over  no just kidding  what do you think guys  gabby rachel any preference  yeah i do not know  you look beautiful tonight by the way  oh thank you so do you beautiful  even with this tie  not that but okay  what do you think about the mullet by the way  but it was oh i love a mullet  you do i was concerned uh huh  one of my best friends has a mullet  she is a girl  okay that is  no it looks good thank you  yeah and you have like a good natural curl  wow this is just so nice thank you so much  yeah i am not this nice the time  so do not get used to it  honestly i am quickly thinking of a way  to insult you but it is not coming fast enough  okay well i will give you a compliment  oh yeah i am here for that  you look absolutely stunning  thank you  i have fake hair a fake tan  do you really no i am just kidding  yeah just a little bit but you cannot tell  because boys are dumb i know  you could have fooled me easily  yeah it is just a little bit  just a little volume in the back you know  the mullet s not real to be honest with you  it is also fake  those are also extensions these are extensions  you can feel it up here  they just like clip in  ah no i am just kidding  stop  i do not know you enough to trust that  i really like erich  it is just so easy with us  i feel like we were making each other laugh  i could really be myself around him  i honestly hate groomed chest hair  you know what i shaved my chest hair once  oh yeah  will never do that again in my life  yeah it is the worst  have you ever shaved your chest hair  the time  let me see yeah you are good  i wax  it gets prickly it is disgusting  you know exactly what i am talking about  no and like men are allowed to have hair  yeah yeah  can i kiss you  i think so  i am on cloud nine  i had a fantastic conversation with gabby  and then we shared an amazing kiss  which is unbelievable  it feels awesome  i was thinking about this i was like man  if i am going to talk to gabby  and she is going to offer me a rose  but then i go and have a great  conversation with rachel like what  is there going to be jealousy involved  i do not know it is like  yeah i was thinking the same thing  like how that if you get a rose  from both how you going to deal with that  or are they going to just say we don t like this guy  he s playing both fields you know  yeah  so how is your night going  it is great  you settling in well nerves  yeah i made some friends  i am doing okay  good so you are from  i am originally from new jersey  i grew up in a town called bedminster  like a very small town okay yeah  it is like actually like equestrian  new jersey like middle of nowhere  wow i have never been to new jersey  i have been to new york like a minute  new york s amazing i will take you around new york  so like this is manhattan  okay we got that we have a map   yeah yeah all right i am following  so like central park  you get like midtown  you have east village west village  this is fun all this is fun okay  so i lived on the west side  oh so you were right in the action  in the mix in the mix right there  yeah right on the edge of my mole  literally right there i lived right there  actually that is me that is literally me  that is me in my apartment  ah that is too funny  rach and i had a fantastic conversation  we were hitting it off  in through this yeah  yeah yeah  oh is this not good enough  there it is yes let us go  i thought about going in for a kiss and i was like  you know what i do not want to force anything  i want things to happen organically  so i am looking forward to talking to her more  i am hoping that i made a good impression today  i think i did  there are obviously two bachelorettes  and they are both amazing  so i can see how this is going to get  complicated very quickly  it is going to be interesting  what if they give the first impression rose  to the same person  the odds of that are like hitting the lottery  you never know though you never know  hello  hi hi guys  how are we doing  doing amazing how are you  i am doing well  i will be back  securing the bag  okay  there we go  one down  it kind of sucks that  she came right in went right out  rachel comes like charging in  and grabs the first impression rose  i was thinking maybe i might get this  and then it did not happen and then i was like  a little bit upset and i was like  kind of like disappointed  whoo  it is cold now  the first impression rose  is a huge deal to me  hi guys  how is it going  it has been something that i thought  about all night and the decision is not easy  tino can i talk to you yes madam  absolutely  congratulations  let us just get going this way  oh okay  there you go there you go  knock one out  see now it feels real does not it  yeah it just hit  i am a little gut punched  a little sting that sunk in a little bit  so  tonight has been a whirlwind for me  and this is a really big deal  but i have been thinking about you  for a while  and i really enjoyed our conversation  you made the stairs  a better place for me on night one  and i really look forward  to getting to know you more  so tino  will you accept this rose  absolutely  looks good  yeah it looks good on me  i think so  well thank you i really appreciate that  i really liked our conversation too  i am glad  yeah  i mean i am going to try to milk this  as long as i can to talk to you  you should  i am here to make you happy  i feel so awesome so relieved  i am so glad that me and rachel had time  and it was meaningful and i just i have no doubt  in my mind that we can build something  really special here so i am so stoked about that  seems like rachel had more of a  she knew who she wanted like whoever that is  maybe gabby s still exploring everyone that is here  and she is still trying to talk to as many people as she can  the rose is still in play  i am like okay there is one more rose left  my time with gabby was amazing and the first impression rose  would be the best case scenario but you never know  so we will see  it is literally do or die kind of vibe  i am feeling a little nervous right  i think everyone wants at least some time to talk  with either one of those two beautiful girls right  i talked to gabby early and i feel  like it could be a possibility i could get the rose  hey man if i get one rose  i will be happy you know what i am saying  one will be good for me  whoa whoa  all right who wants to give me  a dirty look i will sit right here  tino got rachel s first impression rose tonight  you know i would have loved for it to be me   but there is still gabby  and hopefully i will still have my opportunity  we still got one more rose here  yeah  how is it going  i just gave out my first impression rose  oh my god to who  tino  oh i love that  i know oh my god  how are you feeling good  okay so what are your thoughts  like the first rose of the season  this is huge  yeah i know  so big  i feel like they are just such  a great group of men  like everyone is been super honest  and open and just like really wanting to get to know us  absolutely  i am here for this decision  and i am really excited for you  because it is really insane giving out the first  like the first rose of being the bachelorette  oh my gosh i know  okay i think i am going to go do it  go wish me luck  good luck thank you  i have not been able to talk to as many men as i hoped  but there is a first impression rose on the line  i have had such good conversations  but one guy is really standing out to me  i got some time you got some time  i got some quality time  i feel confident that i had  enough quality time with gabby  how did it go it went amazing  i am in a position where i would love  to get the first impression rose  i got time with both women but i am wondering if i made  a big enough impression to receive that rose  all right here she comes  mario can i take you for a second  ooh  hi  oh you okay you good  yeah careful with your dress  i think because he is a dancer  and you know she likes that you know  kind of like that you know goofy kind of vibe  i mean i guess  definitely disappointing  her and i like had a great conversation  we even made out and like i was  feeling pretty good leaving there  honestly i thought i had a shot with that  not going to lie  then i watched both those first impression roses go  and i was like oh damn  i am kind of pissed to be honest  well obviously i have this  oh thank you no  oh thank you see you later  but i just wanted to tell you  i think you know you led with really good questions  and you are like so sweet and genuine  i feel like we got off to a right foot  so yeah  mario will you accept this rose  i will yeah  oh perfect  thank you i appreciate that you are welcome  i am excited that gabby and i got off on the right foot  you know as the weeks go on hopefully  we can continue to build that connection  i am pumped  i got to keep that momentum going  and i am going to continue to look  for opportunities to build on top of that  so i am feeling really confident  first impression rose you all see it yeah hey  first impression rose i says you all see it  let us get it  well we have a rose ceremony in  soon  time s running out it is  i have had zero time with either of the women  i am starting to panic  i would be devastated to go home  you know without the chance  to at least speak with one of them  i feel really good about the guys that are here  but i do feel so bad that we did not get to talk to so many  there is just i mean it is the biggest group of guys ever  i feel the same way  i do not know  yeah  this is like confusing  how you guys all doing  how we doing  well gentlemen look of course i understand  you are having a great time but it is that time  the party is now over and we do now have  to get ready for the rose ceremony  gentlemen thank you we will see you soon  i mean i think we can agree  there is people we do not feel a connection with  but this is our journey  and it is never been done before  we have never had this many men  so i do not see why we could not bend the rules  at least a little bit  yeah let us do this  this was something that i did not even think would be  a possibility that i would come here  and not even get to say more than just like  hi or a couple words to gabby or rachel  so i have it in my mind that i am about to go home  all right what is going on  are you ready  well we are kind of wondering  that is the problem  if there is a different way of going about things  you guys can do whatever you want  listen your journey you call the shots  yeah here is what i would tell you  uh huh  if there are people here tonight  that you know in your hearts you do not have a future with  mm hmm  do you really want to string them along  my heart s pounding  there is not going to be roses  given out i know that  i am just wondering how many of us are going home   it is definitely a tough situation right now  some guys are going home tonight  and that is the reality of the deal  i just hope it is not me  feel like you know what you are going to do  yeah all right  after talking with rachel and kind of deciding  how we want to move forward i am sure that the guys are  probably going to have their own questions  and be really shocked  but we do know what we need to do  all right hi you guys  we know it has been an incredibly long night  and we appreciate you all being here  but for the sake of time we were not able  to of course get to all of you tonight  yeah it is definitely bittersweet  like rachel said we know it is such a long night  we have been in your position before  like you know and it is not ideal  so i really am sorry  for everyone we did not get to talk to  with that being said would roby justin and joey  would you mind talking to us for a second  thank you  interesting  interesting  there are so many incredible men  that i was looking forward to talking to tonight  some guys who really caught my eye coming out of the limo  but the night is coming to a close  and i still have not talked to a majority of them  it is really nerve racking but i think  being able to talk to gabby and really bounce ideas  off each other i feel confident  in the decision that we made tonight  first of all we really  appreciate you guys coming and joining us tonight  appreciate it yeah yeah thank you  so much for your time  i know how hard it is  but i think moving forward  being able to talk to you guys tonight  we have kind of come to a decision  that there might not be a connection there for us  so we really really appreciate you guys coming  can we say goodbye sure  yeah we appreciate it  yes of course  thank you guys  this is a really really hard moment  this is the first time that we are  having to break up with someone  it is so hard in the moment to know that we can  inflict pain on other people and that it is a part  of the role as being a bachelorette  gabby and i have been in their shoes before  and we know how scary it is to put yourself out there  but there are going to be many times where gabby and i  are going to have to make difficult decisions  and i think we need to be assertive tonight  and really show the guys that we are serious  and when we do not feel a connection we do not  because it is gabby and i s decision  at the end of the day  thank you guys for being so patient  we know tonight has been such a long night  and just keeping with the theme  of open communication  we did also want to let you guys know that we were both  able to talk to roby joey and justin tonight  and although they are incredible  we felt as though  we did not have a connection with them  so that is why they are not here with us right now  and tonight we felt like we did not  have enough time to really get to know you all  and that would be doing ourself  and you all a disservice  so we are asking you to move forward with us  next week and cancel the rose ceremony tonight  absolutely  yeah oh my god  coming to the decision with rachel to cancel  the rose ceremony is the first glimpse of what we are getting  that this journey is going to be really hard  thank you guys for being patient with us  and for those of you we did not speak to tonight  we look forward to getting to know you better next week  but i feel like i really could start to build  relationships with just the few conversations that i have had  whoo hoo champagne ooh  i feel like we are starting off  to a really good start  that will set us up for success  and truly finding our husbands at the end of this  but there is never been two bachelorettes before  so who knows what is going to happen  to love  to love  this season on the bachelorette   honestly we just wanted to talk about chris  i would not want you to not know something  so i want it to be very truthful  and allow you to give you a situation  okay  so chris  was talking to a few guys this week  about fantasy suites and his whole talk was  if i made it to fantasy suites  and if they had slept with anyone  i would walk out and leave  okay  so i asked a simple question  would you bring this up before  and he could not answer the question  so people are talking about fantasy suites  no not everybody  who was talking about it it came up  chris brought it up in a conversation  so he is bringing it up yes yeah  i do not even know why sex is being brought up  yeah  i cannot believe this is happening  when i came into this i did not want to look like  a girl that just got brought to fantasy suites  and you know almost sexualized in a way  to hear that being brought up before i have a conversation  with someone is truly almost my biggest fear  okay i just do want to thank you guys  i am going to step away and i am going to talk to gabby  the fact that chris is already discussing ultimatums  to try to take control of our journey  it just is extremely upsetting  and it is not how i wanted this night to go  hi sorry justin oh hi  gabby can i talk to you for a minute  yeah oh my gosh yeah yeah absolutely  okay yeah please  sorry about that no please by all means  yeah we will go outside okay  oh my god oh my god what  yeah tell me  i just got brought some information from quincey  jordan and hayden yeah  they brought me over and they told me that  chris is like talking about fantasy suites already  ew what is he saying about it  he was basically saying that if he was ever  in a position where he was brought to fantasy suites  and we slept with someone else  that he would leave but he would not tell us  what yeah  i am pretty shocked  i have not even had one conversation with chris  so for him to already be talking about fantasy suites  is actually it is like entirely ridiculous  i think we do owe him the opportunity to speak to us  if you are okay with hearing him out  yeah  it seems very controlling  and i think it is disrespectful of our journey and our process  i feel bad that we had to address it because i saw  a look on her face and she was just like  she was like what the hell she was disgusted  she felt extremely disrespected  oh yo bro leave them bro leave them  oh good thank god  hi  chris can we speak with you  yeah i would like to  if you would like to come with us  yeah  this is about to everything up  yeah no joke  nice to finally meet you  so do you feel like it is appropriate to be talking  about fantasy suites this early  yeah so i sat down with the guys the other day  and fantasy suites was a conversation at the time  you guys maybe had some questions about it  i do not think we have questions  we would like to hear from you  yeah i think it is an appropriate thought  because the reality is  if i were going to be able to find love  i tend to think all the way through till the end  and then be able to work it backwards from there  so that would be my response  okay but i guess the problem i have is  they were saying that if you were in a situation  where you were in a fantasy suite  that if gabby or i decided to be intimate  with someone else that you would just leave  and you would not ever tell us  that that was an ultimatum for you  and i think that is not i always want in  relationships the opportunity for me to be able to speak  for myself first rather than for somebody else  to tell you what my words are  like my exact verbatim wording was  i wouldn t want to be in a situation  where that person who i was interested in  had a sexual relationship with somebody else  and then myself  at that situation  i wouldn t be interested anymore  in continuing the relationships  i am not taking away anybody else s decision  and that is something that i would never want to do  to a female is take away their decision  i understand that you are thinking way far in advance  but big picture this is four days in  and your very calculated thoughts  about fantasy suites  are pretty inappropriate at this time  i was not the only person to speak about it  but ultimately the conversation is about me  you were willing to talk about it at depth  which if you have seen our journey  yeah you would know  it would be important to us  and would respect our place as women  yes in our position  to make our own decisions which it seems like if we went  against something you believed in  you would take that time to leave  i feel like i would like the opportunity to meet you all  individually and speak with you  but you all do not want that opportunity with me  i am going to stop you right there  i really do feel like right now  you could take the opportunity  to maybe apologize and own up to what happened  but instead i still feel as if you are  being condescending towards us   i feel like you are dancing around the issue  i thought that i did tell you exactly what happened  we can help make this decision at this point  i do not want anyone to be thinking about fantasy suites  it is so early  we do not even know if we have a connection  right and it sounds like you have  pretty sure thoughts on it  so to not even put you in that place  i do think it would be time for you to go  okay  i am going to agree with her  okay yeah  can we walk you yeah  they told chris to leave yeah  excuse me guys  you can actually lead us out okay  they kicked him out  yeah they just went you can walk us out  all right so how does this work  i literally just walk on this direction  yeah okay  you handled that beautifully  i thought you did  oh my god  that was literally disgusting  yeah and he is like what do i do now  it is like leave just go leave you walk out  that was so crazy by chris bringing up  these things so early and trying to like  control and dictate it just really shows that he is not  the guy for us and i am happy it is over  ultimately if we did not address this  and somehow it got back to them  they would have walked right in here  addressed all of us and we all would have felt like  there he is there he is  yeah friends can i talk to you  definitely let us go and nate can you come  perfect  chris comes walking back in  i was sitting back just like eating popcorn like  jordan can i borrow you yes sir  sweet where is hayden  can we grab him  it is pretty important  he came back  can you guys just raise your hands who was talking  to rachel i thought i just saw rachel like  so was that something that you guys asked her to do  or did she ask you guys to come and do that  i do not imagine she asked you to come  and do it because she did not know at the time  we were discussing what happened  this week and that was brought up  and we felt like they need to  they need to know what was excuse me  talked about that night  can we interrupt you guys yeah you need to  what is going on  ah  we did ask you to leave  you did yeah  i think that is all that needs to be said  okay if they asked you to leave  just be a gentleman and go all right yes  okay yeah absolutely  thank you appreciate it  what chris did does not show  any qualities of what i want in a partner  the fact that he just thought he could do whatever he wants  i do not know if it is because gabby and i are women  but it is our decision and we told you to leave  i am sorry to the guys that that took time away from  because that was kind of brought up  yeah we appreciate like the compassion though  gentlemen i am sorry but it is the time  of the night the cocktail party is over  we got to get ready for the rose ceremony  and so i do have to steal these two lovely ladies  ladies after you  i do not feel at ease  everyone got their time completely  derailed by everything that happened  it is been a long night  i did not get a chance to spend some time with gabby  i think after that first impression rose  she was like hey  and it actually really sucks that  it happened the night of a rose ceremony  i did not get a chance to speak with rachel  but hopefully i made enough of an impression to  you know make it through the night  chris drama took up time that i could have had  and i did not even get to see them  and i do not know what is going to happen at all  i have no idea  i do not want to go home tonight  gentlemen welcome to your first rose ceremony  there are a lot of you here tonight  to be exact so you already know  there is going to be a big cut tonight  many of you will be going home  you are also probably wondering how  this whole thing is going to work tonight  having two bachelorettes  well rachel and gabby they have both informed me  that the roses they hand out tonight  they are coming from both women  it means that both gabby and rachel  they want you around  logan nate johnny  you all have roses which means of course  you are all safe and for the rest of you  if you do not receive a rose tonight   you will be leaving here immediately  i am wicked nervous  this has never been done two bachelorettes  having so many guys it is it is insane  i will go get gabby and rachel  you know jesse said they are going to hand out roses  jointly together and present a joint rose  but i am a one woman type of guy  and i want to go all in on rachel  she is every guy s dream girl so i am hoping that  i get a rose but i would like it to be from her  hi guys  we just wanted to say that we had such an incredible night  with all of you and this decision of course  is not easy  you are all incredible men and we had such an amazing time  getting to know you all more  but ultimately we just really have to follow our hearts  yeah and we just wanted to let you all know that  receiving a rose tonight means that rachel and i both  would like to invite you into next week  jason  jason will you accept this rose  i would love to  aven  aven will you accept this rose  of course  if i do not get a rose tonight i will be heartbroken  erich  erich will you accept this rose  of course gabby  i hate that i was in the drama about chris  and about all the fantasy suite stuff  other than that like i did not get any time  i am worried these women they do not know  who i am and where i am coming from  zach  will you accept this rose  absolutely  jordan  jordan will you accept this rose  absolutely  quincey  i want a rose so badly  i mean just to continue this  with rachel and gabby would be amazing for me  michael  because of chris i did not get time  with rachel and gabby tonight so i am kind of nervous  tino  it does not matter at the end of the day  whether it is from gabby or rachel  i just want a chance to fully show them  who i am as a person  jacob  jacob will you accept this rose  of course thank you  tyler  i am all in on rachel  no question about it it is rachel every day  does not even matter  termayne  i am definitely nervous right now  some of the guys that i felt like did not have  as strong of a connection with gabby as i did  you know have gotten roses  hayden  it makes me kind of question you know  was gabby just being nice  did she actually enjoy our time  meatball  you know i do not know right now  and i am honestly a little worried  looking around me everyone has  a rose it feels like except for me  i was very confident coming in  that confidence certainly has been shot down a little  spencer  spencer will you accept this rose  yes madam  it is difficult attempting to get to know  two bachelorettes  well i had a conversation with rachel  and i do think gabby felt a little slighted  i know she saw me with rachel and she probably  was like what the hell is going on  alec   this evening has been a little challenging  i am just hoping that my name gets called  ethan  will you accept this rose of course i will  rachel gabby gentlemen  it is the final rose tonight  when you ladies are ready  mario  mario will you accept this rose  yes  gentlemen i am sorry  if you did not receive a rose  please take a moment say your goodbyes  bye thank you  giving me time i appreciate that  bye john  that whole thing was tough  pleasure meeting you you too  it was nice meeting you  it was an extremely wild ride and i did not know  that i would be able to have these strong feelings  in this short amount of time  so that completely blindsided me  gabby thank you so much  thank you you too it was so nice to meet you  you be happy okay wonderful thank you  rachel nice to meet you it was so nice to meet you  have so much fun go be happy  thank you thank you for everything  you think you know how you are going to feel  and then saying bye to two beautiful amazing women  it is almost like it is over before it started  so i know these nights can be very long  but you guys truly all made it so worth it and you were able  to really have our backs today and pick us up  i do think my person could be here  i feel noticed and supported by all of these guys  which is the only thing i can ask for  so it has been an incredible night  we really do appreciate you all so much  and we are excited to see what is to come  so cheers  cheers through pushing a super tough night  you know i was the last to get called  it was a nerve racking experience  but i am i am happy to have a rose  just trying to process not only what happened just now  but like also my connection with with both of them  this is actually more difficult  to navigate than i thought  there is two bachelorettes  to love  to love  next week on the bachelorette  bring on the men  ready for my close up  gabby and i want to feel chosen  your smile melts my heart aw  right now i feel so loved and seen  it is really such a good feeling  have you got a date for me  this is all about finding love and like i feel like  i am going to remember this for the rest of my life  it just feels like a really beautiful start  to what could be something really amazing  if you were the only person here  i do not think i could have the heart to continue  i don t want a woman like you  it hurts to hear  like because there is two of us  they think they can act that way  i do not know if i have the capacity to keep  doing this like week after week  will you accept this rose  um  dude the girls just walked out  my brain is spinning right now  i want to know what the hell happened  this whole thing  is just not working for them  that is bad it is really bad  i am leaving i am literally quitting  and do you guys like spaghetti and meatballs  we do yeah that is one of my  i got a little surprise oh my god  got a little oh my goodness  i will be in the middle thank you  you know how i like meatballs  i am lucky that i got both of you  it is like getting the president i mean  two of us equal the president  i mean  cheers to meatball let us all cheers to meatball  and let us go cheers  let us have a good night cheers  thank you yeah  going to have to do that again  so i come from a big family  i got two brothers and two sisters  we all have nicknames  my nickname is meatball  as i said in my entrance what are their nicknames  sausage so  meatball can continue to just pull gabby and i   gentlemen how we doing  everybody doing okay  um i know i am not who you were expecting to see  but i do have some news for you  i know you all were really excited to see gabby and rachel  tonight at the cocktail party  but that is not going to happen  because the cocktail party is officially canceled  so you all will be moving  directly on to the rose ceremony  now what are you kidding me  that really is not the only thing i want to tell you all  rachel and gabby have realized  that this whole thing is just not working for them  and to be honest if this thing continues to go down this path  they are not going to find love  so at the end of the day that journey  is over  but that does not mean they are just willing to give up  this is how it is going to work  gabby and rachel have decided  that the best way moving forward is to continue  on their journeys separately  if you accept a rose tonight  that means you are committing to dating one woman  that woman that offers you the rose that you accept  and not the other  there will be one group of men for gabby  and there will be another group that is pursuing  and committed to rachel  fellas look this really could be  the biggest decision of your lives  i will see all of you at the rose ceremony  good luck  well that was a big shock  holy  cocktail party is canceled  i did not see this coming  this was time that i needed  so i can speak to both gabby and rachel  and kind of get you know that clarity from them as well  so i do not know what to think  it just goes to show you you should act on something  when you feel it  i am going to follow my heart the best i can and uh  if i am lucky enough to receive a rose  i will act according to what my conscience tells me  i think the guys tonight that are on the fence  the the pressure s going to be put on them  obviously these guys are really going to have to  figure out you know who they want to pursue  at this point i have committed to rachel  hopefully rachel feels the same way i do  we do owe it to the ladies and to ourselves  to kind of make that decision  you know if this helps prevent another night like last night  like you know i am all for it  they have their mind made up  so if you have not done what you needed to  you are going to go home  guys are losing their marbles  and we are going to see how this night s about to go  but i can tell you right now this will be  the craziest night in bachelor nation history  tonight is a rose ceremony  and rachel and i decided that we are giving out  our own roses to the individual men  who will agree to come on our journey separately  we overcame so much  on our previous journey with clayton in our last experience  but i think we have to kind of be brave enough  and separate at some point  and this rose ceremony is the beginning of that  you were not there last night  i am all right so this what happened  tell me the vibes bro  yo it was so bad  like she is probably so upset right now  myself and zach are in the winner s circle for rachel  and erich s in the winner s circle for gabby  so we are kind of just sitting around waiting  to see who comes out for each side  and kind of take it from there  this is probably going to be a pretty stressful uh  stressful rose ceremony  this is what i am worried about is  people will be like you know  if i get a rose from this person i will say yes  when the time comes to it  when you are standing up in front of that you know  woman that maybe you did not exactly expect  will they stick to their word  i do not know that is tough  i know and i hope they do  because you are playing with their heart  gentlemen welcome to your second rose ceremony  i know it is not what you expected  i am sure by now you have noticed  there are two pedestals with roses  rachel and gabby have each individually decided  which men they want to continue dating  i really hope that each of you has given strong consideration  with respect to where your feelings lie  do you see a future with gabby   or is it with rachel  i wish you all luck  i am excited to finally go on my own journey  and for gabby to go on hers  i feel confident in the group of guys that i want to pursue  but i am really nervous for gabby  because i definitely did not see  what happened last night happening  i know that i would be so shocked  and so hurt if that happened to me  and if someone were to reject her rose tonight  this could end in disaster  thank you guys all for being here  i know it is been a crazy week  i think having two bachelorettes has  provided struggle that nobody could prepare for  personally for me some conversations last night  were hurtful and the impetus that we needed  to move forward in our two separate journeys  so with that we can begin  tino  tino will you accept this rose  absolutely  i knew it  hey shh shh hey calm down  nate  nate will you accept this rose  absolutely  what is up e money  nate it is nate  nate it is nate  i am excited to get a rose from gabby  i feel good with our connection right now  but um i hope rachel gets to  you know choose the people for her as well  logan  logan will you accept this rose  yes  welcome to the club  i am curious to see if anyone says like no  yeah  johnny  johnny will you accept this rose  of course i will  so far tonight has been going really well  i think this is a great thing  that gabby and i are getting our actual own love stories  oh here comes somebody johnny for sure  good this is this makes sense  this journey it is it is not the beginning anymore  and i really hope we can start getting to that point  and really getting more clarity on who our husband is  termayne  termayne will you accept this rose  look i do not want to be the guy  to first decline the rose of the night  but i am going to have to decline the rose  i feel like we could be great friends  outside of this obviously  but i feel like i have a deeper connection with gabby  i am going to have to decline the rose  gentlemen ladies  right just want to clarify here  because obviously this is all new  you declined rachel s rose   yes all right  because you are holding out for gabby  mm hmm  all right i think what we need to do  is put termayne back in line  and then find out if gabby s going to offer you a rose  okay  it looked like termayne got up and then came back  yeah  wait wait wait wait  did he turn down a rose  oh people might have  turned down a rose  now rachel i am so sorry  but because termayne rejected your rose  you can no longer offer that rose tonight  now termayne you have made your intentions very clear  you wish to pursue gabby  but termayne if you do not receive a rose  you will be leaving us tonight  thank you all  termayne rejecting my rose was so embarrassing  because it was in front of everyone  it was not only embarrassing but just really surprising  because i did not think him and gabby  had that strong of a connection  spencer  spencer will you accept this rose  yes madam  getting rejected it is humiliating  but i feel like i owe it to myself to prove to myself  i can be strong enough to hold it together  for the rest of the rose ceremony  alec  alec will you accept this rose  um  unfortunately i do not think i can  uh i just do not think i am the right one for you  that is okay thank you  thank you rachel  pleasure to meet you  no one else has came out here  are you catching that jesse just walked in  jesse just walked in are you hearing that  rachel i am sorry again  but i do have to take your rose  what  this is weird  i think you know looking around  everyone just kind of had this feeling of like  oh my gosh what is happening  like you know just because it is awkward  jason  jason will you accept this rose  i would love to accept this rose  get closer  thank you  tyler  tyler will you accept this rose  absolutely  when i first found out i was the bachelorette  the first thing my parents said to me was  can you handle this emotionally  mario  when they said that i was like i am so strong  i can do this of course  but what if i am really not strong enough to do it  like maybe they were right maybe i cannot do this  maybe i should not have done it  ethan will you accept this rose  absolutely  i feel terrible for rachel  because i know what it is like getting rejected by these men  kirk will you accept this rose  yes absolutely  last night i did allow some of these men  to make me feel terrible about myself  jordan will you accept this rose  always  i know what it is like to wonder  what is wrong with me  can i actually do this what if it happens again  quincey will you accept this rose  of course  i think that has to be what is going on  in rachel s mind right now  meatball  meatball will you accept this rose  i am sorry um i cannot  i am here for gabby  um i just have to go with my heart  okay i appreciate it i am sorry  no thank you  did somebody else say no  meatball just rejected rachel  all right boys what is going on right now   my brain is spinning right now  dude the girls just walked out  the girls just walked out  like it is  but that does not  i cannot like  to hear three people one after another  stop me and say i can t accept this rose  it was so humiliating  it was the hardest moment i have had  as the bachelorette truly  yeah it just is hard because the whole time  i just thought like you know it did not work out  with clayton and i did not ever expect to be bachelorette  i did not  rachel gabby it is the final rose tonight  when you are both ready  and so it is just hard to like  really feel like i deserve it  because i never feel like i did  and then to be rejected again multiple times  after you already feel like you do not deserve it  is hard  i feel so lucky to be here  like i am lucky to be standing next to gabby  and i still feel that way i do  because she deserves it  michael  michael will you accept this rose  yes i will  to find love is what i am here for  but if i get rejected one more time  i am ready to walk out and leave  i am ready to be done go home to florida  i am why am i here  hayden  hayden will you accept this rose  absolutely  gentlemen i am sorry  please take a moment and say your goodbyes  thank you  thank you so much termayne  i really respect you  tonight was a little awkward at times  a little rocky at times  but i think for kind of the first time in this journey  i feel like i am in control  we made it  barely  walking in and seeing  my nine guys waiting for me  i just feel elated  i feel like good things can come out of it  and just so excited for what is to come  here is to love  to love  to love to love  coming up next week on the bachelorette  ohh  paris is romantic  there is something in the air  paris just does something to you  there is going to be two separate groups now  we are on two separate journeys  love to you is just the ultimate thing  and that is exactly how i am  i never thought i would be able to find someone  and like now it is right in front of my face  every time i am in the same room as gabby and rachel  i realize my feelings toward gabby  he made a vulgar comparison  something about i don t trust these bitches  i have tried hard to put my feelings aside  but the heart wants what it wants  every single day s like a roller coaster  why does she look pissed off  do you know why i am talking to you right now  the shock on their faces  no one even knew what i was coming from  tonight rachel was given some information  about some things said that was really disturbing  i hate every single day having to get  to the point of wanting to leave  i am just so over this i am so done  when rachel offered me a rose  i just think i  made a decision you know in the moment  and immediately when i said it i regretted it  i think i did make a mistake  hey rachel  could i talk to you for a second  i just feel like there might be something there  i just   today was really crazy  because i started off really emotional  but the guys really did step it up  and i got to make a tough decision tonight  which was to bring someone over  and to have some one on one time with them  oh my gosh hello  hello how are you welcome  you look absolutely gorgeous  i truly think having tyler over tonight  is the best decision  he really stood out to me today  oh  that was perfect that was good right  i am just really excited to get to know him  because i feel like something could be there  i am happy you are here  i am more than happy i am here  i think today you were extremely vulnerable  everything you did truly touched me  especially down to the poem  and the fact that you just had it in your pocket  i know i know  i just i just had a lot of feelings from last night  and i was not sure if i was going to get a chance  to read it today  but i was really glad i got the opportunity  well me too  cheers to you cheers to you  are you kidding me and to france  and to france absolutely  but kind of like you said  mm hmm i am very curious  to hear more  with the poem mm hmm  yeah i wanted to know more about it  yeah no absolutely  in the beginning you know kind of like  talking about a past relationship that i had  mm hmm it was deeper than  you know anything i have ever experienced before  i i was ready to commit fully  i bought a house for us  wow mm hmm  and out of nowhere  kind of she just said she could not do it  said that you know she  she could not be with me anymore  that you know she was going through her own stuff  that must have been really hard  yeah it was tough  but the thing was that i took from it  i knew the pain that i went through and it hurts like hell  but the love that unconditional love  that i was able to feel  was the best feeling in the world  and i want to give that to the right person you know  mm hmm i am not scared  of getting hurt again because like i said  that feeling is ten times better than the pain  yeah and it is worth every second  i feel like i see so much of myself in you  yeah like you seem like  you are just so willing to just love and be hurt  because love to you is just the ultimate thing  yes and that is exactly how i am  and i have not met many people like me  neither have i not even saying that like  i am special but i just feel like getting hurt  is so worth it to feel love yeah absolutely  it is the best feeling in the world  mm hmm it is what i want  at the end of the day  i want the unconditional love  me too and like the hardest part  was trying to find somebody  who can love as hard as you can  mm hmm and it seems like you  really really love hard mm hmm  and that is when i was just like oh my gosh  i would do anything to meet this girl you know  to have a conversation with her at least  like i came here for you  and you know that  so prime example like  when i knew how passionate you were about  being like a pilot mm hmm  and if i had to take care of the house  i would be doing the cooking and the cleaning  whatever i had to do just for my wifey  so you are okay with that  absolutely yeah okay  okay with that yeah  mm hmm so  you are saying the right things  that is what i want in life  i want to be somebody is rock you know  i love that yeah  and i want you to know that when you walk into a room  you are the only person i see  so yeah  i am so excited about tyler  he is so unafraid of love  he truly did make me realize that this was working for me  i think that fear is definitely behind me  it is such a good feeling  so what is on your mind  every time i am in the same room as gabby and rachel  i realize my feelings toward gabby  at the first group date  we had a great connection  it was like fireworks at first  mm hmm but after that night  i never got to talk to gabby again  but then rachel gave me a rose  these roses are extremely extremely important to me  it truly means that i do see a connection  tyler yes  will you accept this rose  absolutely i will accept that rose  you accepted the rose from rachel  at the last rose ceremony knowing that you were  then expected to date her and only her  i have loved getting to know her  but i i do not see how i can move forward  without bringing it up in some way  what do you think she is going to say   she had a lot of guys reject her rose  i am terrified to think that i could be someone who  could add to the laundry list of disappointments  i am more excited  are you kidding me  right so i will make a cheers  okay all right  i mean do you think it is real  i mean do you see a future  with you and gabby  i need to know first if she felt what i felt that night  there was a lot of unanswered questions and feelings there  yeah  i need to talk to gabby  hi  i missed you  it is been kind of a tough week  but also one of the best weeks i have had  where these guys were really able  to let me know they are here for me  ad i feel really really good  i am so excited for tonight  coming into tonight with no rose  gives me encouragement to kind of get that one on one time  and see if we can build this connection  for me this one is all about honesty  it is time for me to come forward  with some honest truths  so looking forward to that part  tonight at the cocktail party  i am going to have a conversation with gabby  and express my feelings for her  i want to know if gabby feels the same thing i feel  no matter how wonderful rachel truly is  the heart wants what it wants  here you go ladies  thank you  hi guys  i am really happy to be here  with you all today in france finally all together  and a lot of you really stepped up this week  i had a little bit of a rocky start  but i appreciate of you guys  as hard as it has been to be away from gabby  i feel as if we finally are on our own journeys  it is been crazy without rachel  i think we miss each other every day  but i think we are finding our footing  i feel like connections have been flourishing  at like rapid speed  it is honestly been insane  but i am incredibly grateful for all of you guys here  so cheers to a great end to the week  cheers  well shall we  at the group date this week nate really had  a sweet sentiment before his match with erich  how are you oh i am doing good  he is so mature in so many ways and just  is not afraid to make me feel special  knowing that he notices the little things  makes me feel so so good  so how i know  how have things been for you  they have been good really  yeah this this week  was actually pretty good  okay and i wanted to say  thank you so much  what you said in the boxing ring  was so sweet really  yeah like i always feel like  i am being seen by you which is so nice  i appreciate that  i was so nervous going in  like i am not really like the most eloquent with words  but i do care about you and you are important to me  it was so nice yeah  so i wanted to share something  that is very important to me  yeah with you  so this is rambo  and um oh my goodness  oh my gosh  i want to show you a few pictures of him  oh my gosh  yeah oh my god look at that one  the other day when we had the group date  i did not get any one on one time with rachel  and i did not get the group date rose  it makes me a little bit nervous  especially going into a rose ceremony  you look so happy there  i am telling you he is he is one of the most  important things in my life  yeah my main goal now  is to get that rose tonight from rachel  and i have something to share with her  something that will take our relationship  to another level  so this is kind of where like  it starts hitting  a little bit differently now yeah  about eight months ago yeah  he um got diagnosed  with a brain tumor mm  and you know it happened within hours  mm hmm i mean it was just  i mean his entire head caved in  oh my gosh i am sorry and you know  the doctor kind of said he goes  hayden if you do the radiation  if you don t do it he can have four to six months left  and if you do it you know he could have a year  oh my so he only so you think he only has a year  he at this point probably only has a couple months  oh my gosh  i am so sorry and and i am obviously  telling you this because i want you to understand  that you know i would not be here  if my intentions were not to try  to obviously further our relationship right  i definitely can tell how much he means to you  and i do appreciate the fact  that you are sharing this with me  i know how much it probably takes   for you to be away from him  i definitely feel for hayden  it is genuinely sad how much he does love his dog  and how hard it is for him to be away  this is his cancer duck that went through  obviously all the radiation appointments with him  oh my gosh obviously i cannot  carry that around but what i do carry around  is one of his duck paws  oh my goodness that is so sweet  well oh my gosh  yes so  i cannot imagine how much this means to you  when you all have a moment  i would love some time with rachel  yeah of course are you doing all right  yeah yeah  thank you so much appreciate it  for sharing this with me of course  i appreciate it thanks rachel  so good talking to you  it is very tough to see rachel s response to that  what i would have expected  from rachel is to you know give me a minute  let me finish this conversation  not get up quicker than she sat down  it is very difficult for me to feel okay  walking out of that conversation  and feel comfortable saying that is the person for me  hearing this from hayden  you know hayden s got a history of saying  you know mean hurtful things behind her back  it is just unacceptable  my dumb ass uses the same verbiage  that gabby uses to describe herself  and she did not like that  well bitch maybe you should not use  that word to describe yourself then  oh my god  i have been comparing right  i have been comparing my ex  to like like this right  they do not hold a candle to her  man and i do not want to just settle  rachel gave me a second chance  you know she is very honest with me  and you know i want to be as honest with her as possible  do you want to sit down yeah  you know rachel needs  needs to know that  how you doing  i am great how is your night been  no it is so good  i am so happy to see you because  i am so happy to see you too  you finally are out of the doghouse  thank you  but  on a serious note okay  there is something i need to tell you  mm hmm  i do really like you a lot  you know i respect you  you are very honest with me  and i want to be very honest to you  there was a conversation that i had with hayden  at the mansion and it was pretty unpleasant  it was after the rose ceremony hayden  yeah after in la  in la okay  he said that you and gabby  were both overreacting to what he said  hmm and then  he made a vulgar comparison about you and his ex  it was something about breasts  and he also said that i don t trust these bitches  referring to you and gabby  i really appreciate you  bringing this information to me  and yeah it is definitely upsetting  but i think i am going to have a conversation with him  if you do not mind  mm hmm is that okay  yes absolutely well thank you again  seriously for bringing this to me  yeah i really do trust james  i do not think he would be a liar  i trust his character  it is just like so disrespectful  especially the morning after i give you a second chance  and then call me a bitch  it just hurt because of how much i sacrificed to be here  yeah he is got a brain tumor  he could die at any moment  why does she look pissed off  i do not know  and you know to have it  not completely received that way i  hayden  do you know why i am talking to you right now  no rachel i do not you do not know  i am assuming it is about rambo  about the dog  i think so  that is what i would have said  hayden do you  okay i have spoken to a few people  about how our conversation went  mm hmm and um  you know to be frank i think our conversation  got interrupted with tino  that is what you think is happening  i think so okay  i really i appreciate you sharing it with me  but i had some more information brought to me tonight  and i am actually really upset about it  because i feel after what was said about gabby in la  i was willing to kind of move forward this week  and the next day you went and said  i can t trust these bitches   that is not what i said i just do not believe you  well that is fine but it is not what i said  okay  did you make comments  comparing me to your ex  my boobs to your ex  no  you did not no no  i did not say anything i did not compare anyone  to you okay  this is not conversations between us  okay i am not talking about the guys either  i am just like i am having oh my god  oh hayden this is just hard for me because  i feel like it is something one thing after another  it is very upsetting that anyone  would even come or say that  i do not speak like that okay  that is not my character  the person who brought it to me  i really just do not feel like would make this much up  i really feel like i gave you the chance in la  yeah i am giving you  the chance now to own up to it  and rachel explicitly i am telling you right now  that is not what i said okay  i just really feel like  this is kind of the end of my rope  i am hitting roadblock after roadblock after roadblock  and i cannot keep doing it  i cannot really keep dealing with it  can i walk you out  yes okay  i feel really stupid for giving hayden  the benefit of the doubt  he just lies and i feel very taken advantage of  because this last rose ceremony was really difficult  only the next day call me a bitch  and say you could not trust me after i was trusting him  to bring him into a second week  at this point i am just extremely ready  for hayden to get the out to be frank  rachel i respect you as a woman  and i just i heard you  thanks okay so  thanks hayden  she walked him out like it is that simple  i do not want to see her upset again  like she was upset two nights ago with us  for some other stuff  he said that  i don t trust these bitches and  hayden did not say anything too kind to rachel  i do not ever want to see rachel hurt  so pisses me off  i really wanted this to work but  i want rambo more  i know right now for a fact that  no one has the amount of love that i have for rambo  and that rambo has for me  i am blessed that i have rambo  who loves me unconditionally  rachel i hope you find someone that is going  to treat you the way that rambo treats me  i am ready  i am ready to see rambo  i am just like over this  i am tired of having to like deal with this  every single time  it is like i am tired of having to do this  over and over and over and over again  can we have one day where someone does not act  like a  i feel like i keep having great days and then  something will happen  and i just feel really exhausted  it is just so hard because i know  that this is working for gabby  i think she has some amazing guys  who really really care about her  all i could think about was you the last three days  mm hmm  mm  no matter who it is even if it is someone  you are not like this is my husband it is rejection  you just want to sit there and be like  well this is not working for me  i am a failure  it is hard to every single day be like  i feel so good then i feel so bad  it is like every single day is like a roller coaster  i am having too many of these moments  just i am done  this night took quite a turn  i am at a loss for words  gentlemen  tonight rachel was given some information  about some things that hayden said  that was really disturbing  she was really hurt  we are going to cancel the rest of the cocktail party  see you at the rose ceremony  good luck gentlemen  there is a lot of people that did not get time  i did not  you did not get time   no  yeah i definitely had a couple of things to say  i am pretty frustrated  i want to tell the truth  i want to be honest about my feelings with gabby  there is no way i can move forward with rachel  i do not know exactly what i am going to do  should i keep accepting roses  pretending like everything s cool when it is not  tonight i made a decision  that hayden just is not here for me  he is not the man for me  but thank you so much to those who continue to trust me  and i am really excited about my connections here  so thank you guys  yeah and same  thank you guys as always  honestly it was such a good week  i really am deepening so many connections  so i just want to thank you guys too  for trusting me on this journey  nate  nate will you accept this rose  yes  hey what is up guys  big dog here it is  come here man  what is the scene out there  two people are going home  really on both sides yeah  hayden s already gone for rachel s side  it is going to be a trial  aven  aven will you accept this rose  of course i will  aven  what is up fellas i believed in you  what is going on man tyler did not believe in you  i did  erich  erich will you accept this rose  yes of course  i am here for rachel and i think what we have  is something pretty special  honestly like when i am with her  time stops and um  i have incredibly strong feelings for her  so getting a rose tonight would mean the world  so you are thinking zach next  who are you thinking  yeah i am i am thinking that too  yeah for sure zach yeah zach for sure  no way  what is up dude what is going on  good to see you  johnny  will you accept this rose you know i will  god the anticipation  it is nerve racking  it has not been an easy week for rachel  so i have no clue how she will react  about my feelings for gabby  this could be an argument this could be a disaster  it is going to be devastating  the longer i wait the more damage will be done  zach  zach will you accept this rose  absolutely  thank you very much  michael  michael will you accept this rose  yes i will  who would shock you guys the most  if they did not get a rose  logan logan  i think logan too yeah  it is just interesting that  he did not get time tonight  i do not know if he is trying hard enough  i feel like we are going to be shocked on this one  yeah it is going to be logan  for sure sheesh  wow  gabby rachel gentlemen  it is the final rose tonight when you both are ready  so we got one more rose one more rose  just curious to see who comes through that door next  why they got to make it so stressful  mario  mario will you accept this rose   with her and i think if something is  meant to be it comes natural  i can run faster than you than you think  ah  i really do believe that what johnny  and i have is really special  i love the inside of johnny  the things i think that he is maybe scared to put forth  are the things that i love the most  oh my god  johnny he does not know how romantic  or how sweet or how special he is  but i am really grateful for him  and just so excited to see where things go  i know it is just the beginning for us  going into tonight this is an interesting  rose ceremony because we have logan here now  that kind of adds like a weird dynamic to this group  that like we have somebody new  i know some people are not feeling comfortable  i mean i do not feel comfortable  i cannot imagine how they feel  it is just starting to get more real so i think  tonight i am curious to see who goes home  anticipation is a little bit  i am like who is walking in here  is logan walking in here  i know  i want them to come down so bad  tonight is going to be a bit of a curve ball  i think with the gabby side  with logan moving over to their side  i am sure that stirred the pot quite a bit  gentlemen  going into the cocktail party  i just feel discouraged that we got logan from rachel s side  what has he done to this point to be worthy  of coming into the journey  i do not know so i am nervous going into tonight  how is the week been for you guys  i mean  so the group date was canceled  you know rachel was not feeling ready for it  there was a lot going on that day  to hear that you know those events had also carried over  and affected rachel to the point of changing  the group date is really concerning  and i am sorry about that  i think you guys understand my intentions  uh you know there is always concern you know  when you think about number of roses  now there is a little more concern  because there is same number of roses more guys  i have not had that real time with her yet  and may not get that time  so hopefully the connection is strong enough  it is been a long journey to sit next to gabby  and it has not been an easy one  i am sorry oh  but when i am with her i am breathing fast  i am feeling butterflies  i want to keep this  but you know what i never asked gabby for a guarantee  i just asked her for a chance and she gave me that chance  and tonight i really want to capitalize on that chance  and i am hoping that i am rewarded with a rose  hi guys thanks for being here  first and foremost i want to apologize  to everyone who lost time this week  but i am so excited to have  another night with all of you  and i am so hopeful for what is to come  yeah  coming into tonight  i have these overwhelming feelings  of this all becoming so real  i see these relationships flourishing  and also getting really hard  but with great risk comes great reward  so cheers to a great night and let us have some fun  cheers to that  logan is the big question mark  that we are all wondering how much gabby really sees in him  his connection may be stronger than we assume  just because i have a rose does not mean that i feel  secure in our relationship  i do feel good about it but you never know  i love your laugh  well i do have something for you  you do yeah  it is a little gift  i do not know if you have been souvenir shopping in belgium  but open it  there is  it is belgian chocolate for your daughter  i know you really miss her  thank you so much  mm hmm of course  okay  i am nervous  my fate tonight is completely unknown  gabby either has to give me a rose   who is been in the house for two days  and turn away one of these other guys  who have been like solid for her  does that count  that counts all right that counts  which is not fair because you wore this dress here  and i was distracted  a lot of these guys are going in with weeks and weeks  with gabby you look amazing  thank you  you do too thank you  this was my first impression suit so you know  ooh  i thought i you know let me go ahead  time to tell her who they are and learn about who she is  you like to pick on people in like a good way  in a good way  but you have earned my sweet side  you have been so sweet to me oh thank you  knowing that makes my odds seem pretty slim  you impress me no you impress me  you have a very like individualized way  of making me feel special  it would be astronomical for her to pick me over someone  who has been unwavering  i feel like we hit it off from the beginning  and like every time we talk i want you to know  that you know it is just us yeah  but i do not want to lose this  the only way i can get  to a level with gabby that other people have  had the chance to is by being myself  i was not able to be part of the last group date  you want to get slapped by a fish  you guessed it  first we have to play rock paper scissors  kay and then you let me win  okay  rock paper scissors shoot  no we are on the same cadence okay  thank god okay  which side do you want  good side bad side  obviously what is your good side  um  oh  wow that is it  in the throat  went to my neck  okay  okay  i can smell the fish  does it smell bad  now that logan s here it is just sucks  especially for people who are you know going to get sent home  like i would totally feel some type of way  putting in all this work and then logan  stepped in and just  gets traded to the kings drops game one  like yeah that is tough cannot win  it was already game seven for some of us  and now it is overtime like  i am pretty nervous going into tonight s rose ceremony  i think gabby brought logan here for a reason  you know does she see something in logan that  she does not see in the rest of us  so it is you know kind of makes all of us  but especially me kind of doubt where we are with gabby  gentlemen sorry to interrupt  the cocktail party is now over  so we do have to get ready for the rose ceremony  i think logan coming over is going to push someone out  who may have not been getting pushed out  i think my chance of getting a rose tonight  are actually low but you know  logan just came back into the equation  he has not had much time with her  so anything can happen  you know i have been in the gabby trenches  since the initial onset  hopefully she sees that  so i hope logan does not get a rose and is sent home  going into tonight s rose ceremony  i am anxious nervous obviously  if i do not get a rose tonight because of logan  i just will be you know extremely upset  logan getting a rose makes me nervous  because that is one less rose to go to not just myself  but also the guys that have been with me  in the dating gabby trenches  so i hope logan does not get a rose but i have no clue  i might be shocked if logan comes down  he is had the least amount of time of anyone  and if she does pick him then it is like you know  it is very telling yeah  i know i would be nervous as hell  yeah  i am feeling a little uneasy about tonight s rose ceremony  because logan moving over to the gabby side  really hurt rachel  it is on everyone is mind where her head s at  i feel like i am definitely on the chopping block tonight  and the only person that i have to blame is logan  hopefully i get a rose but i do not know  it could be any one of us going home tonight  i feel like we are going to be shocked  at the first person who walks in  the real question is do we think logan gets one or no  i think he does  i think he does too  and it is going to because some  a stir   i just wanted to say first of all  i truly am lucky to know each and every one of you  of course going into every week  there are challenges  just know that if you do not receive a rose tonight  ultimately i just have to follow my instinct  and i truly appreciate each and every one of you  yeah this week has been incredible  i think each week keeps surpassing the last  in so many ways so thank you so much  from the bottom of my heart  curious to see who comes down  i am too  i think the first guy is going to be  um erich for sure  yeah  jason  jason will you accept this rose  of course i would love to  damn boy  what is up j with the number one  how is it going man number one  you made it you guys are one and two  how many roses were on the table  we had four  oh  and rachel had three  wait rachel had three  if it is not ty first ty is second  there is no way it is zach  it is got to be tyler  i can see zach coming in last actually  zach  zach will you accept this rose   on paper the odds are not in my favor tonight  spencer  i am going up against guys who have gotten to know gabby  for five weeks  would have been much easier to continue on  and commit to rachel without a problem  but it would not have been right  tyler  because i have had another week to figure things out  my feelings have been sorted  i know what i want and i have put it out there  now a rose means  that is either accepted or turned away  erich  and it is intense  erich will you accept this rose  yes of course  because i am not sure at all  that gabby feels the same way i do  gabby rachel gentlemen  it is the final rose tonight  when you are ready  there is only one rose left  i am scared you know  there is a chance that this is the last time i see rachel  ethan  i love you bro  ethan will you accept this rose  absolutely  it is down to me mario and mike  so it is now or never  until logan walks down i am still like  not even like considering that as an option  i think it is going to be michael but  i think it is mario  i think mario comes down those stairs  i think it is mario i think it is logan  logan   logan will you accept this rose  yes  she gave me a rose  she stamped it made it official  i feel great  i feel incredible  gentlemen i am sorry  please take a moment and say your goodbyes  i mean three guys up there  i have had the least amount of time  one of them s had five weeks with gabby  michael gabby  thank you for everything yeah likewise  one of them got the first impression rose  it is been a fun ride thank you for everything  no problem  and yet she chose me to get the rose  ah  wow  logan s coming down  plot twist of the evening what is up  hello gentlemen what is up man  congrats thank you  congrats  i was not sure that logan was going to show  but now i know that you know he is here  and he is vying for gabby s affection and love  so welcome to the squad i guess  so michael and mario are going huh  yeah wow  i would respect it if it was mario  because he is been putting in work  but to each his own  in all honesty it was tough to see  but weak links are gone  thank you  hi hey gabby  and is getting real  hello how are you doing  good  everyone is a hitter  we are setting sail to a place  where it is very romantic  shocker  it is an even playing field now  and it is anyone s game so might as well be my game  somewhere that is known for its landscapes  there is no point in stopping now  full speed ahead  me and gabby  we are going to amsterdam  still to come this season on the bachelorette  i can say now with confidence  i am falling in love with you  i truly feel like i am on cloud nine right now  everything i ask for you really embody it  i really cannot imagine my life without you  this is the best day ever  i have always wanted to be with someone like you  but just never knew if it was possible  he has like really shown me what it is like to feel loved  i feel like all my dreams are like coming true  sometimes if things are too good to be true  that is exactly what they are  too good to be true  there has been a situation with logan  she was in tears  i feel awful you got to pack your bags  watching her kiss somebody else  is absolutely sickening  this is a joke  tino is acting like a real baby back bitch  i am terrified of not just being a mom  but being like bad at it  i do not know what to do  i am just so conflicted now  i just do not understand  i feel so blindsided by you  i do not want to be with a boy  i want to be with a man  after overnights you change your mind  you told me things and then you went  back against what you said  i am so sick of this  i do not want to do this anymore  he never loved me  how do you move forward  you cannot like you cannot do that  i would like literally rather be alone  he said he cannot

ever to forget like  how amazing you are because you really are  incredible and that is why i am so like  falling very very hard for you  because you have so much to offer and you are everything  i could ever ask for in somebody  i just want you to know that  i just feel like my heart is beating so fast right now  tyler continues to be so vulnerable with me  and tell me exactly how he feels about me  he is falling really hard for me  and that is huge for me to hear  i know this is a big week and i do really appreciate you  kind of like opening the floor and you are like  yeah you know family is the most  important thing to me mm hmm  but i do want to kind of say that  family is the most important thing to me as well  i love my family more than anything  and they mean the world to me yeah  and honestly getting to know you  you mean the world to me too oh  i want to introduce you to them  i was like  waiting for the person to like open up my heart too  and it is you  rachel is definitely  the person i could see myself falling in love with  absolutely  of course i would like that rose tonight  and to be able to go to bed tonight  knowing that i can bring rachel home to my dad and my sister  it is just tough  you know there is some stiff competition  you never like think in a million years  you are actually going to end up at hometowns  and it is crazy  it is so wild it is so real now  i mean whoever gets this rose tonight  like you are locked in hometowns  introducing the family yeah  yeah i mean tino s been a front runner  in all of this since the beginning  i mean on the first impression rose  right right  and he did get crowned the cheese king too today  and he won today yeah guy stays winning  i am trying not to think about it  to be honest yeah  next week s big man  i think tonight is like you got to lay it all out there  right right  cheers to that cheers  so i just wanted to like make sure that you were feeling  okay with everything about next week  and kind of what it looks like and  i would have done it two weeks ago  if i could have wrapped this up rest assured  i would have been stoked to bring you back  how has your family reacted to people  that you have brought home in the past  i am not worried about like really anybody  when they see and hear how i feel about you  they are you know like you know my personality  i will be like you are going to like her  but like i mean you just  you really leave like no doubt in my mind  have not had a doubt in weeks  any reservations with me  um i have a couple  oh yeah what is that  i think i just totally hit it  out of the park and i am like almost speechless  it went unbelievably well  i do not want to leave you with no doubt  because i am just so sure of you  oh yeah  this kind of excitement that i feel for her  is like unfamiliar and it is exciting  and exhilarating and terrifying  at the same time  and this is a rose though like  i want more than usual  i am really expecting it because i would like  to literally think i am her person  i did have such an incredible night with all of you guys  of course this is very important so  um  i just want to say that you all have been incredible tonight  but this rose can only go to one person  and this person continues to make me feel so incredible  and i could not be more confident  that i would just love to meet your family next week  and so with that being said  tyler will you accept this rose  absolutely   i had such a great night with all of you  with that being said i will wish you guys a good night  i will see you soon  okay bye guys  congrats seriously  i am at a loss for words  i do not get it  like i hit every point today  had the amazing moments  i mean we literally were just talking about like  she feels so strongly for me and like  i just cannot see something  connecting on a deeper level than that  like getting it after i crushed today  and that would be like  i am rolling into hometown and i am about to fight  zach out or aven out  or anybody else who tries to in these waters  you are toast done let us roll  tino s acting like a real baby back bitch  yeah  i mean he is won the day you know  i would be feeling pretty  good about myself if i won today  i mean you did not win  and i still got a better attitude about it you know  this is a joke  it really makes me wonder if i am not seeing things clearly  i do not think she knows how deeply i feel  the fear is that i am falling really hard  for this girl and she is not  and that never has occurred to me until tonight  and now like this is making me second guess everything  all right so rose ceremony tonight  so i wanted to check in with you again  see how you are doing yeah thank you  how you feeling  i am feeling better this morning  i know this has been a really  really tough week for you obviously  yeah with nate now gone  yeah  now everything that is happened with logan  yeah  how does that impact how you feel about  your relationships with these other men  potentially going on for hometowns  i want to leave here with someone i feel good about  i want to be in love i want to find my person  mm hmm but some of my relationships  just have not been able to progress the way that my other  ones have and there is truly no explanation or rhyme or reason  some relationships you feel like  you are just not compatible  all right so then what do you want to do tonight  at this point i am not really sure  but i think i need more time  to really weigh of my options  i know you got a lot to think about  i will leave you with your thoughts  yeah  and i will see you at the rose ceremony tonight  okay thanks jesse okay all right gabby  thank you we will see ya okay thank you  rose ceremony days are always  definitely really heavy  this week i had to send nate home  and then logan cannot be joining us for the rest of our journey  and so now i have four men  but i still have hard decisions to make  it is taken a lot of thought in considering hometowns  but i think i have a pretty good idea  of how i want to proceed into the rose ceremony tonight  not trying to like invalidate your feelings  i think just last night we we just  you know took some disrespect to you know walking off  because you know we are here for the same reason  the end shook me a lot yeah  that is why i kind of was not could not really focus  during the chat after yeah  and i split a little early and i feel bad  i should have been there to like be there for you guys  for sure and yeah  you had a good day yesterday man  during the day right  just yeah i mean but you still want like  the night was you know i felt like next level  you know i felt like i hit new levels of vulnerability  not just with her but with like anybody in a long time  yesterday made zero sense to me  i did not get the group date rose  and it just felt like a blind side  i told her repeatedly that i was sure  and it looked like it lit up her world  but you know now i am thinking well  she did not say she was sure  not getting that like does you know inevitably  kind of draw certain insecurities where you are like  is she not as sure as i am  or you know as i want her to be  and i want to leave her with no doubt  and i thought i did last night so  i do not know if i am just not seeing it correctly   i mean at this point like i have no idea  if she is going to be like meeting my family  and friends or if i am going home  it is hard to look at it and not think of it  as a huge step backwards  tonight s a big rose ceremony  it is huge i am very nervous  if gabby were to look at you and ask if you accepted a rose  i think you know she is saying i want to continue this  this is going in the right direction  and i would love to meet your family  nobody has a rose going into tonight s ceremony  i think a lot of us are just kind of  questioning where where we are  i am not alone in that  but there is usually four hometowns and logan is gone  so seems like nobody should be going home tonight  honestly i do not know  just going in there hoping for the best  walking into the rose ceremony  i see three roses on the podium and obviously  that means one person is going home  and it was pretty shocking  i think everybody s a little nervous  hi guys you guys all look so handsome  i just wanted to thank you all for the most  amazing week in the netherlands  i cannot thank you enough for being here with me  this week for us threw us a ton of curveballs  so many things that truly i did not even know  how to plan for  i feel like i am not at the point where i can meet  four men s families  i do only feel comfortable  you know giving out three roses  erich  erich will you accept this rose  yes of course  jason  will you accept this rose of course  gabby is one of the most incredible women  i have ever met and i know that my family  and her would have an amazing time  i want that rose from gabby tonight  there is no question about it  johnny  johnny  will you accept this rose go on  this makes me happy thank you  i feel ecstatic right now  i feel like we made a connection  and i feel like there was no denying it  she gave me a rose and it is like whew i could breathe  talk about nerve racking dude  god of course man  you all truly make me feel like i am the only girl  in the room in your own unique ways  which i think makes tonight s decision really  difficult because all three of you are truly incredible  and my heart already breaks thinking about having  to say goodbye to one of you but ultimately  i think i just have to follow my heart  this week i did not get the group date rose  that i thought i earned  that hurt  it made me like question everything  and now me aven and ethan are on the block  i want this rose so badly right now  this would not bother me this much  if i was not like falling in love with her   aven  aven will you accept this rose absolutely  gabby rachel gentlemen  it is the final rose tonight  when you are ready  tino  tino will you accept this rose  always  thank you beautiful  made it the nerves wash away  i have never been so stoked  hometowns let us go let us do it  spencer

really really falling for this girl  like i cannot wait to introduce you to my family  and tell them everything about her  how do you guys feel  excited  yeah hometowns like yeah  i think this could be one of the best  weeks here and the most exciting  and honestly i am grateful that you are  welcoming me into this big part of your life  i am super excited  i think once i see my parents they are going to be like  oh  like this he actually likes this girl  this is when it gets real  to hometowns to a memorable  yeah yeah  cheers to this amazing lady right here  i am super excited i get to show

of the future  this is the best day ever  i am in love with you rachel  i have been falling in love with you  i feel so happy  i just feel sorry for those other fellas  that is all i could say  it is scary to like open up and show somebody  my entire world  i am terrified because i know how much i have to lose  just trying to stay true to myself  it is important to keep in mind  what would it be like without her  it makes me cry  when you know you know  we are going to have to have a talk  you are living like a fairy tale right now  i mean you are saying the right things  but i want to see him fall for the right person  i do not know how i made it out of that house alive  i almost cried  i feel bad not saying this to you earlier  i care about him so much and then to hear that  i feel like my heart is breaking  do you know how to ride a bike  it is been years  i do not remember if i know how  to get on my bike let us see  this is going to be entertaining okay  i am actually a little nervous  oh i am so nervous  okay you read this is really  who put my seat up this high  does it go up  i cannot reach the pedals you got this  i believe in you i am scared   it is been a journey yeah  but the only thing that is really like  that is keeping me going is how like loyal my mom was  to that relationship and to him  and at no point was she giving up  it is a bond that they have that you know  i think it is really rare to come by  yeah  i need you to meet them and i need them  to meet you in order like to move forward with this  i am grateful that we get to spend today with your family  especially given the circumstances  i hope they know that i do care for them  because they are part of you  and like i really care for you  soft music  it is been a long time since i have seen my dad  and he has like a very advanced cancer  and it is terminal  we just do not know how much time there is  and it is really really really sad  so do you know everybody  donna allan elise grandma grandpa  yes  i think this is a very important day  for me and for us  okay  i know she is the one  that i want to bring home and like  she is the one that like i want to be here  and i am excited for her to meet my family  especially my dad  hi  hi mom  i am gabby nice to meet you  hi i am elise  gabby nice to meet you  i watched you all on the bachelor show  oh you did  i was wondering i know gabby  you do  yeah sure  sit down  oh thank you sit down grandpa  it is been crazy it is really good  to be back at home  how have you been  i have good days and bad days  yeah so  i mean i kind of filled her in on everything  she was an icu nurse  i did hear that  this is the in home nurse here  labor of love  everything that you guys are going through  it really means the world honestly  for you to allow us in  soft music  my dad is  he is struggling for sure to be there to meet gabby  and for it to be like a family thing  right grandpa you can go enjoy the outside now  i have to like show my dad how much he means to me  because it is really important  i missed the hell out of you man  i really did  how are you doing okay  oh wow  so yeah i had some pretty serious operations  yeah but i am still here  and i am happy i am positive  you know so that is good mm hmm  but i really admired  the icu nurses they are so sharp right  we get really close to our patients which  yes you do yeah  i got a weird form of cancer called  appendiceal right appendiceal cancer  that is where it started the last cat scan showed  that the cancer came back  you know it is being a little more aggressive  but i already went through three rounds of chemo  the first two did nothing  and the third one almost killed me  mm hmm  your mother s really hanging in there  she really is yeah  she is gotten sweeter aww  it is hard taking care of somebody  i am sure it has been hard with erich being gone  i have really never met anyone like him  he is a little special yeah  i seriously like her and i think it is kind of  whispering he would not say that otherwise  both laughing  i would not be here and i would not tell you that  if i did not think that her and i had a true connection  our first date he really just spoke  to what a great relationship that you and donna have  and how it is been so amazing to look up to  and like that is the kind of love that he wants  and we have been lucky yeah  watching now how hard mom fights for you guys  and how hard you have been fighting  it is really inspirational  my dad really liked gabby  which is a huge sign for me too  but my mom i always want her approval  and i always need it so  i need her to know how much i care about it gabby  you know i would not have brought her here  if i did not have feelings for her  and i would not have put you guys through this  i want you to know that like  you know i am constantly thinking  about you and dad and  has he been doing like similar or  mm worse  little bit  yeah yeah  but i keep watering that flower  it keeps coming back  yeah yeah  just seeing how like undyingly you love him  and everything you have done for him up to this point  it is like i have kind of modeled  what i want after the bond that you and dad have  it is important to have that feeling  like you could not live without them  yeah  and we  we marry for life  yeah  you do not take it lightly  yeah okay  i know  it is an important decision  yeah okay  crying softly  i know how hard it is for my family to open up  and to let people in   because we are very protective of each other  but my mom she can see  gabby does mean the world to me now  so for me it was like huge  erich he talks so highly  of you and allan and elise  i mean just so amazing  and the way he loves you guys is like  that is what i look for in a partner  yeah family means a lot yeah  we just keep trying to move to the future  yeah yeah absolutely yeah  and allan seeing him today he looks so great  and it is such a testament to the way  that he is being taken care of now  yeah he has an incredible will to live  yeah he has a lot to live for  yeah because we all love him  you cannot not love allan  yeah  he is a great guy  so i just want to make sure that you guys  if you decide anything that commitment to my family  is really important  yeah  we do not give up on each other ever  yeah you cannot quit  yeah ever for anything  you know we have been allan and i have through  we will be married years and we have been through a lot  you always have to  stay together and be together always  yeah  i hope you know how much i care about erich  and even coming here now  everything makes so much sense  you can tell how much love you have for each other  and i just feel lucky to be here you know today  erich s mom being vulnerable with me  knowing what she is going through  really meant the world  thank you  today really was so special  indistinct chatter  what an amazing example of love  his parents have been able to show  i felt so close to them  today with erich was one of the best dates i have had so far  thank you for coming today  seeing him with his family  that really just made my feelings  so much deeper for him  and like i cannot wait to tell erich  how i feel tonight  laughing  what do you think about bedminster new jersey  both laughing  way better than i expected honestly  erich seeing him with his family today  and seeing his family s commitment  to be together it is so beautiful  thank you  today really solidified and clarified  my feelings for erich  and there is no denying that i do have  these great great great feelings for him  i will never forget today  today just like was very real  yeah  and very real and very important to me  it is like a huge deal for me to bring someone home even  and even this context yeah  like my dad is not doing well  like that is the reality of the situation  and you can see how hard it is for me not to be there  and like not even be in contact with him  so i think like ultimately like they were  really i think surprised  to see how like much i like you  and how much i wanted you there  because like that is all they want too  is for me to be happy  and for me to be with somebody like you so  i am like really grateful that you were there today honestly  i have risked a lot to be here and it is all for you  and like i am like genuinely happy about it  and i know they are too  i think being here today really shows  like the sacrifice you are making  and i really cannot imagine how hard it is truly  i did not have any doubt of like why i wanted you there  and you being there  i came to see you like in amsterdam on the boat  and i was like you know  i told you that i am falling for you  and i think like words carry a heavy weight  but i am really falling for you gabby  i think maybe now i might even be falling in love with you  and i think that is kind of scary  but i really freaking am and  soft music   you literally are so amazing  laughs  i think i have been like thinking it   but obviously like words do carry a lot of weight  especially here  and today was really telling  and seeing you with your family  and all the things that they had to say about you  that you have never said about yourself  they raised like a really good man  it is telling to like how much you put them first  and i think i have like always wanted  to be with someone like you  but just never knew if it was possible  but like after today  i do finally feel comfortable in saying  that i am falling in love with you   i feel so much for her and like i am falling in love  with her and like i told her that  and to have her say that back to me  was like the most beautiful ending  of like the most perfect day  and i really mean what i said   i am most definitely falling in love with erich  and that means the whole world to me  saying goodbye was so so so hard  you are amazing  i am going to miss you a lot  like a lot a lot  i will miss you  i can picture us so easy together  and today i think is a day  that i will really never ever ever forget  okay bye bye okay  after today i think erich s hometown  it could have changed the rest of my life  horn honking  horn honking  hi  what is up babe  laughing i am so excited to see you  today i am in santa clarita california  and i am seeing tino and meeting his family  nice ride  i am so excited for today  but my last hometown was really hard  i was not ready to meet tyler s family  what is up  missed you missed you  light music   it puts pressure on today  just because i do see a future with tino  it is really a big deal for me  that his parents are accepting of me  if they do not approve of me and like me  then how am i supposed to move forward  you excited for tonight  i am so excited i am very nervous  you know the approval tonight what if like i do not get it  like how  well you are going to i am just saying  but i just want you to be confident when you head over  and you will nail it  but i am nervous  this is a big huge deal  i want them to feel like i could fit in  because i am really serious so it is really important to me  that they at least give me a chance  i am so serious about you  and i am so serious about telling you  you have nothing to worry about  okay i promise you  i am so excited too  a lot at stake  a lot at stake but you are going to crush it  is it real right  because there is four other guys here  she could like any one of them as much as she likes him  but what if tino s not the one she likes the best  right and how does he know that  i do not know how tino deals with that  bright music  gasps hi guys  i get to go first i planned this  you look so tanned  hi baby guys  hi everyone how is it going  hi hi  i am rachel rachel i am sandy  nice to meet you nice to meet you  rachel tonight is meeting my mom sandy my dad joe  and my little brother mateo  this is mateo my little brother  thanks for coming out mateo nice to meet you  i think it is tremendously important  that tonight goes well  because i really want their approval  like so very badly  i am so excited to be here  i have not told rachel that i am falling for her yet  because i think i have just been waiting for the right moment  and i think once she knocks it out of the park  with my parents it will be like the table s set  like just right out of the gate it was like   so electric talking to her that where maybe it was difficult  or other people had to like you know look into things  i was like i was pretty darn sure yeah  and she i guess felt the same  because the first rose of the season went to me  so yeah that was pretty cool  and it really just is better every single time  we are together i do not know how  since then like  i mean as like cheesy as it is going to sound  like everything disappears like when we are together  so it is like when we started talking  it was like it just flowed aww that is nice  yeah but how much time do you guys get together  each cocktail party we found plenty of time together  yeah there is never been a time we have not talked  yeah but are not there other guys trying to talking to you  are not they all doing the same thing  i mean how are they  they are striking out  laughter  yeah no i mean it is definitely  it is different  so you guys have a couple more weeks  so what do you guys think what do you do next  the next two weeks are going to be like  i mean what are you guys hoping to find out  she will send the rest of guys home  and i will propose to her in a couple weeks  laughs  what are you talking about  after after two months  yeah  when you know you know  tense music  we are going to have to have a talk  okay man to man  i was not expecting my dad  to be really stringent with his questions  clearly he is really skeptical about the situation  i am going to take you outside and we are going to have a talk  shall we yeah let us do it  i want rachel to be able to see herself in this family  but i am like to some degree afraid  because i do want that stamp of approval  i got a lot of questions  first question is lay them on me  it is been a very short period of time  mm hmm  do you really think this is where you want to be  yeah without a doubt really why  i mean how how in just five weeks  do you know enough about her  i know the important stuff  we talked about stuff that we want for the future  and stuff we are insecure about and every reassurance  that i have felt like i needed i am getting out of her  you feel like you have had that much time to connect  like at different levels yeah  i just have a hard time believing that what you can do  on a whirlwind fairy tale trip  is really going to prepare you for marriage  and i just want to make sure your head s in the right place  and this whole fairy tale thing and everything  has us more probably more nervous  than you are you know  because we are like this is you know our kid  and we want to see you be happy the rest of your life  it is just been an honor to get to know him  i really just feel like i have never met anyone like him  so i thank you for sharing him  so what do you think tino s best traits are  he is seriously so positive and his outlook on life  is truly something i have never seen anyone have  he was like yeah you know i give  i give blood all the time  and i was like well why  he is like well there s a shortage  and i remember just being like oh my gosh  like he just cares so much he s so giving  if you think you met him outside of  so this is not real  this is not real well it is  well but it is not like how you normally meet people  and how you normally do things of course of course  you are in this insulated mm hmm  i guess bubble yeah  so you have a huge decision coming up  mm hmm exactly  so i have got to figure out in a week or two  if i am mending a broken heart or planning a wedding  yeah  and i guess you do too yeah  talking to tino s mom i feel like  she is just skeptical about the whole thing  how much time do you get to figure this out though  this is a big decision for you  right now it is about two weeks left  wow she grilled my ass  and now i am like scared to talk to his dad  this has hit me like really hard  okay  i guess my first question would be is  how can you make a connection that quickly  you got to appreciate the skepticism  oh no completely  it is extremely expedited  but i think we are able to talk about really serious things  really quickly and see if we want similar things  if we line up with our morals  i have trouble wrapping my head around the fact  that this could happen that quickly  and so tell me what is tino like  convince me that you know him the real tino  i think it is just the way he looks at life  and his positive outlook  i feel like i have so much to learn from him  and he is so humble and caring  and people just gravitate towards him  sighs  do not take this the wrong way it just sounds  i mean you are saying the right things  and it is like that is all great  but at least in our mind  from feet away  we see it as like this fairy tale thing  like i said i am looking out for him  yeah it is nothing against you   i am just making sure  that he is making the right choice  and that it is the right match  yeah  like i genuinely almost cried  because i thought it was going that bad with his dad  and i did not know how to answer his questions  how can you talk about tino this way  but there is still other people you are obviously exploring  those potential relationships  i literally was like okay this is actually about to end  and i want to see him fall for the right person  so how far have you and tino talked about like  let us say he is there at the end of this  i mean are you expecting an engagement  what is the plan  yeah no i am looking for an engagement  and he i mean has told me  that that is something he is ready for  he definitely i think is a little bit slower  with his feelings and he definitely  holds back a little bit more  so i am definitely kind of just waiting  to see where he is at with all this but yeah  that is definitely something i am looking for  no i mean sighs  i do not want to beat a dead horse  the hardest part about all this is just  this is your second go around and  i was asking tino i was like  well you know is this person just looking to get married  or does this person you know really like you  i would not put him in this position  just so i could get married  i am not that type of person  i really want to meet someone  that is going to be my partner for life  like i say you are looking for an engagement  so you have got your mind set  and you know when he talks about  that this could go further i am just like  tino are you ready  and you know are you sure  both of you should be honest with each other  and make sure it is right  yeah  well i appreciate it thanks for chatting with me  no problem  tense music  and thanks for having us over  this has been so great   i just feel like he just did not like me  and just was like i hate you  i m like okay  to be like almost expecting to be engaged  like right then it is like you still do not know enough  would you want to be engaged with someone  you do not know enough about yet  i feel like i need to breathe  i just feel like i do not even know  it is like okay everyone hated me  so where do we  i just feel shook up by them  shook up  like i feel like i could do no right  i feel like i could be the most perfect person  they would not have liked me  you know hopefully over the next two weeks  from what i heard  you know you guys have a lot more to learn  about each other and make sure that whatever happens next  is you know the right thing  yeah  and just be open and honest  yeah i really appreciate you guys welcoming me in  and i really do appreciate the hard hitting questions  i really no i do respect it so much  because it really shows me how serious you all take it  on top of how serious we take it so  that is good  it has been incredible to see  we all should  where you come from yes absolutely  so thank you so much we all should yeah  right well we are going to head out so  okay all right  it is time for us to say goodbye  i have stressed the importance of hometowns  and the importance of them at least giving me  a chance to see if i could fit in  and i do not even feel like they  like i feel like his dad is like  i hope you do not come back here   like i do not know how i made it  out of that house alive if we are being honest  i almost cried  we would have to really sit down and talk about like  is he going to be okay moving forward  when his parents just are not going to be happy  oh my god what a night  i felt like i just  i really wanted this to go well for you  yeah yeah  they did adore you i promise you  i do not think they  i am going to be honest i do not think they like me  they definitely adore you  tino they do  i am not too confident  your dad was not even giving me a chance  tino they were tough on me  yeah they were hard on me too  but of course they asked  like are you sure are you sure  and this is where like i feel bad like  not saying all this to you earlier  like rachel  i am so sure about you  you always make me feel appreciated  and valued and loved like every time we are together   i was not sure if it was a magic trick or not  that he had kind of pulled before like showing up here  well of course it is so great too  because the last time that we were all here on this stage  was when you both found out that you were  going to be doing this whole thing together  how great has it been for both of you  to have each other for support throughout all this  we always say we would not have it  any other way which is true  i think the support that we have given each other  is something that people in our position  have not been able to receive before  and we leaned on each other so much  and it made our experience that much better  yeah we have had  highs and lows and throughout it all  having her here has just been the ultimate thing  yeah it really has been uncharted territory  two bachelorettes on your own journeys  you are dating the same group of men  gabby what was the hardest thing  to have to navigate at the beginning of all this  do you think  surprisingly i felt like  the men kind of showed us  that it was hard to navigate  i mean we did not know what to expect  i feel like rachel s and i communication was so good  throughout the whole thing but the most unpredictable part  was how the men would react to two of us  which is understandable it is never been done before  yeah of course  anything you think you two would have  done differently when it comes to dating  the same group of guys  i mean of course we made mistakes  we are only human  but ultimately we were just following our hearts  and really doing the best we can  i think you forged your own paths  i think you guys have done an outstanding job  together throughout all this  i want to ask you both about first impression roses  of course rachel you gave yours to tino  you gave your first impression rose gabby to mario  and i think for people watching that back  it just never seemed like you and mario were able to capture  the magic that you had on that first night together  what do you think happened  yeah i think a lot of it was the navigation  of having two bachelorettes  i had thought after our first conversation  that he wanted to get to know rachel  which i obviously understand why  but there was a lack of the communication there  i did not know what side he was on  and things progressed so fast  and i think the men started popping up left and right  i m here for you i m here for you  whereas i did not quite know mario where you were standing  you can see in our last conversation  you were like i m all in on you which i appreciate  but it did seem a little late  compared to some of the other men  i think that we had a great first night like you said  we had a great connection  and the following rose ceremony  where i did have a conversation with rachel  it was just to have a conversation  i think you know that third rose ceremony  where we chose sides i was with gabby  and i did not pivot right  and we did see that this season with a few guys that did pivot  and you know one being logan where he was accepted  and i was sent home because of that  and so for me i just felt like you know  i just felt kind of like you did me wrong  i am sorry you think that i did you wrong  because i think i also feel the same way  and that there was never a conversation  leading up to that point  until almost it was too late that you were here for me  because to me it felt like you were still entertaining  both sides until i made that decision for you  but i also want to be chosen  yeah  okay rachel i want to ask you  about your first one on one date with jordan v  that really was hi jordan  an out of this world date  it really was  it just seemed like it was going to so well  yeah and then of course  you sent him home that night  what do you want to say to him  i feel like from the beginning  we definitely had a connection but i think ultimately  throughout this whole journey my biggest fear was  i never wanted anyone to feel like  they were being strung along  and so it was such a hard decision  but i just really was following my heart  at the end of the day and i really am sorry  no i mean obviously it is great to see you again  and you look absolutely stunning tonight  i love that dress it is fantastic  aww  but you know like i  i just i appreciate you so much  and honestly like we had a great  we had a great connection we had a great date  like honestly that zero gravity  something i will remember forever  and so i am just glad i got this opportunity  to be part of your journey  yeah thank you and i think  jordan v is going to have no problems going forward  gabby i know the first couple weeks  of this whole thing for you was very difficult  it was very emotional  and in part because of some of the horrible things  that hayden and jacob had said about you or said to you  jacob s obviously here tonight  what would you like to address with him  what would you like to address with me jacob  it was extremely hurtful what i had said obviously  and it took me watching it back and to see that moment  i mean i still have so much emotion towards it  you mentioned it yourself  i just did not have self awareness  i am realizing that now and i am trying  to learn and better myself  just know that  just know i am sorry for my actions  and i know you may not accept this apology   but i am truly and deeply sorry  thank you so much i appreciate it  thank you  obviously i know that this was  an incredibly emotional journey and experience for both of you  and i know that there were different times in all this  when you questioned whether or not you were deserving  of being the bachelorette  what do you think it was that made this  so much more difficult than what you even expected  i think it is definitely a crazy position  that no one can ever foresee how to navigate  if you have never been in it  and you deal with so much self doubt  especially when you are finding love  and i think everyone can really relate to that  but having gabby at the end of the day  and always having a major support  is the reason that we were really  able to make it through it yeah  after having gone through it i love you  aww  i cannot i do not think that anyone else  did not feel this way  i think by having rachel and i as support  we were able to vocalize it for the first time  it is a lot of pressure to date this many men  we have all been in relationships where we doubt ourself  and now we are in ten times those relationships  and ten times the doubt right  i do not think it is anything personal  i think we are just open and transparent  about how hard the role is yeah  it is really really hard to overcome no doubt about it  i think it is so great that you both had  each other for support throughout all this  i mean america is just loving your friendship  it really has been special  the real love story we just headbutted  this is the real love story  all right we are just getting started  with gabby and rachel  and if you love getting some insight from bachelorettes  please make sure you go and subscribe  to the one and only official companion podcast  bachelor

their season and we are having  some tough conversations  i do want to continue and rachel  i want to ask you about logan  infamously of course everybody remembers  he accepted your rose at that rose ceremony  only to then change his mind on the ship  and decide to pursue gabby  what would you like to say to him  i was obviously hurt because i did keep my heart open  i just wish you were a little more honest earlier  but i understand  that is totally fair  you know there is times that i could have  done things differently  and i think i was looking for the perfect time  to have a conversation where it was private  and where i could say everything i wanted to say  and where it was the right place and the right time  but i wish i did not wait for the perfect time  and the perfect place you know  and that is a lesson i will take home  and you know i am still learning and growing  so i appreciate the both of you for giving me  an opportunity to do that  so i am trying to be better  yeah and i do want to take a second  ethan meatball and tyler i am sorry about bruges  you guys did not deserve to have your date cancelled  and i want to thank you all for being so understanding  and for always being able to pick me up  but i am sorry you guys had to do that  and look i know you both had some very emotional  connections on this journey and of course  that always leads to very very tough and difficult goodbyes  rachel i want to ask you about tyler  saying goodbye to him on his hometown date  on the boardwalk in new jersey  before you even met his family  i know that had to be really really difficult  yeah  i really did feel like we have always  had such a great connection  i knew the importance of family to tyler  and i knew the level that i needed  to be at that night for him  and i did not think i could get there in the end  but i do want to thank you so much for all of our time  together because i cherish every moment of it  i truly do  it was tough but honestly  i think you did everything perfectly  i know that it did not end the way i wanted it to  but i respect what you did  and you did it with the most class  your best attribute is being able to show how you feel  and wearing your heart on your sleeve  and that is something i respect so much  so i just want to say you are absolutely incredible  all right gabby  your goodbye with nate in amsterdam  was probably one of the most if not the most emotional  goodbye that we would ever seen  what is it like seeing nate again  it feels so good to see you again  because you did have such an impression on my journey  not only with me personally  but i do think you were such a leader for all the men  in how well you treat women  thank you so much  you know i know our journey did not end  the way i wanted it to  but i do not think because it ended it was not beautiful  we had one of the best friendships   that led into like a great relationship  and just seeing it back and watching us grow  i get emotional every time because no matter if i watch it  five times or times like it was real  and it was raw  and i appreciate you giving me the chance  and the time to explore it you know  how you handled it with so much class  like i think the way that we ended things was beautiful  because you know how momentous meeting my daughter  would have been and how much that would have meant to me  and for me to open up that part of my life  and i cannot thank you enough and tell you  how much i admire you and i still adore you  thank you oh my god  enough with the serious stuff though all right  time to lighten the mood we all agree  bloopers oh that is right  you know exactly what i am talking about  it is blooper time  my conversation with eric is going to look  completely different than

this  do you learn anything about dating  yeah well the whole movie was inspired  by our dating lives and the lives or our friends  so it is all about the dos and don ts of dating  the important things you know  this really is like a boy meets bro love story  that is what it is about yeah  we do all the things you see in any love story you know  we drive each other crazy we fall in love  we fight there is sex  it is all a lot of fun  it is going to be great  gabby and rachel i want to ask you a favor  because we are so lucky to have both billy and luke here  i thought we would play a little game  are you guys down down always  okay it is a game that i like to call the bros decide  dating dos and don ts  and what we are going to do is show clips from the season  and let billy and luke decide  if that is a dating do or do not  oh this is going to be good  are you both down less for us more for them  yeah yeah wow  i hope you guys are ready  gentlemen you should all be nervous right about now  everybody ready for this unless it is about me  right  so first up i have heard when it comes to a first date  that you really cannot prepare too much  but then again maybe you can  uh oh  so you guys have minutes to prepare  and you guys better bring it  oh mysterious i like it nice  what is in yeah what is in there  open it up  i was thinking oh what s in the bags  you know what kind of gifts i love gifts  hey oh speedos  little did i know it was going to be this type of gift  yeah they do not cover up very much  i need some extra help too  some guys who maybe felt like  you did not stand out with the talent  like maybe stuff the speedo to stand out a little bit  i am sure some people stuffed  going to let it hang out there  no all right  right billy luke what do you think  dating do or do not  first of all that looked more like the set of bros  than i thought it would yeah  i do not know about the stuffing  i do not i think that is a dating do not  yeah because if the date goes well  eventually they are going to find out  yeah i like to do the opposite  i make myself bad  that way when i show up  people are pleasantly surprised  you know  i just want to know who out there thinks  it is a good idea to put themselves in the position  in the first place as a guy to be in a speedo  before you answer that i actually think  you should tell us do you guys like seeing a guy in a speedo  oh we loved it yeah  there you go all right  there you go what is there not to like  maybe that is why it took me  about something years to get married  i had not figured that one out yet  right up next they say  you always remember your first kiss  but i think this next kiss that it may be one  that both parties would love to forget  oh no oh  you look very beautiful

shared between mario and gabby  how did mario do dating do or do not  it was an intense kiss  it was a lot yeah  but you both kept going back for a little bit more  so how did it feel  it looked like  yeah i know i think it was nice  yeah  i think for me like that was the first time  i had spoke with gabby and so when you were like  he s a great kisser i was like yeah  and then i got on like twitter  and i was like oh no and everybody  i think it was our position  we were like this yeah  we were reaching  but you know whatever works  right right it was the first one  and then you kissed

bachelorettes navigate these final days  will gabby and rachel find love at the end of their journey  or are they going to leave brokenhearted  do not go anywhere  welcome back to the men tell all  yes after tackling billy eichner  meatball is still here and i know that  because i can smell him  meatball you look like you still got  some sauce on your collar  i know saving it for later leftovers  we tried to clean up meatball the best we could  okay gabby rachel look you both made history  this season as bachelorettes  i know it has not always been easy  but i wanted to take the chance to tell you both  you need to know just how proud i am of the two of you  i have just been so amazed at your ability  and how you have handled everything  how you have supported each other  it really has been incredible to watch you two do all this  and i know it is not over yet  thank you of course yeah listen  i do want to ask you both each one final question  rachel any regrets  i do not think i have any regrets at all  i think a lot of people can look at us being emotional  and judge us from the outside  but i think gabby and i being able to wear our heart  on our sleeve is brave of us  and i am so proud of you  i am so proud of you aww  and do you stand by all the decisions  you have made thus far of course yeah  and if i did not i would never tell you  just keep those to yourself  yeah those are for me to know and you never  you got a good poker face i like it  there is obviously so many twists  and turns that are coming up  i really do think that bachelor nation is going to be shocked   like amazing moments that i am like trying to just take in  me too  like this is a moment right now  everything s a moment so  it is so crazy but it is like  i cannot believe that we are here  the mansion feels like yesterday and years ago  and years ago  it went by so quick but then again  i feel like it is never ending like it is like forever  like i am stuck here  yay roses  whoa  i got another one what happened  no but it does feel like that  it feels like forever ago but yesterday too  i feel like every time we are together  i think i see a new side of you which is nice  even i feel like you are getting more comfortable with me still  i mean like i am trying to  how are you like what you feel really  what you do not think i  no i no i feel like you are comfortable around me  oh for sure yeah  yeah but still i feel like not a whole lot  but still like got to get somewhat more comfortable  i do not know yeah no absolutely  i think there is always going to be some of that for sure  i think you have opened up too a lot  even just from the first time yeah  yeah  whenever i am with johnny it is so easy and effortless  being with him feels so natural  he is really taught me to trust people  should we do this  and has led me to the point where i truly can see a life  together outside of this  i am so hopeful about a future with him  there is something about being from colorado  that whenever i feel cold things on my feet  i get thirsty  that is strange  that sounds like a you problem  whoa this is for us  oh my god wow  but before i move into an overnight with him  i need to know that he can see a future with me as well  i feel like you have been so open with me right away  it is like you have taken it upon yourself  to take a chance but  definitely do not open up that quick  so i never talk about how i feel  like i do but it takes a while  and like i think you helped me evolve in a way  i have said it before but you make me  want to be a better man  well i think you like always had it in yourself  and you were just ready you know  just needed that person  yeah  i think like you were  seems like at the point in your life  where you were ready to like take a leap of faith too  for sure  yeah i feel like i was just kind of feeling stuck too  and just kind of needed to go in a way  and this was like huge in that process  and a lot of it is to thank you for so  like i said before i really did not know  what i was going to get coming into this  and like much like you have grown here  i think so have i  and i have like grown into really wanting  something you know yeah  it is like time to make a relationship  like my full priority  i am just like at a place where it is what i want  and like need almost  i like  it is a hard thing to think about  it is such a quick process and that is like i do not know  like i know how i was feeling about you  i am so into you yeah  and i just the end result scares me  i also did not know i would be here on the beach with you  and falling in love with you so  hearing you say how you feel about me  like means the world no matter what  and like these weeks have been so fast  and like we are like ending you know  like a week or a little over a week  so i do not know  kind of like what do you like  i am at a place in my life  where i do feel like you know i am like ready to be engaged  i mean are you asking where i feel  about that whole thing because we have a week left  no pressure no pressure  yeah  that is a hard thing to think about  it is like a battle in my head  i do not know like what to think or what to do  and like you deserve everything  and you should get everything you want so  you too where do i stand in that  and that is like such a hard thing to decide  i am just like at a place like  i am like i am ready  i told you like i can see myself  falling in love with you yeah  i can see me and you being together  but it is more so just me bringing to the table  and if i am ready to bring and if i am not  do i drag you through that  yeah   just give me a second  it seems like he is not able to commit  it is just really frustrating  because i am so ready at this point  to leave here engaged  with someone who is committed to me  but what if he feels like he cannot or should not be with me  i am feeling really frustrated  because there is a part of me a big part of me  that has asked to be loved my whole life  so having to ask johnny about his feelings really hurts  i am terrified that johnny might tell me  that he cannot get there  but i do not want to step into an overnight  knowing that there is still big questions being unanswered  it is all good  no  you just have to like be honest with yourself  and me because it is not fair to either of us  you know if we were at the end and then having this talk  life with you would be insane  mm hmm  you are exactly the person that i would want  to like fall in love with and just be my person  forever but  but i just do not know if i can get to an engagement  in the next week or so  you know it is not that i do not like you  it is not that i am not falling for you  it is not that i cannot see myself with you  it is just more so just like it scares me  and  i do not know if i can bring to the table  and commit to that end result if i am not ready  that is just me being honest with you  no i know and like  as much as i do not want to tell you that either  because as much as i want to just hang out here  with you forever i just yeah  it is obviously really hard to hear  there was like a big part of me  that hoped  it would be you know like us one way or another  but i feel like  we are just we want two different things  i think like if it was  like a different time for both of us  then we could be so so great  you deserve the world you are an amazing person  and you should get everything you have ever wanted so i  that is the hardest part about relationships  honestly like you want them to work  you want them to work but if like timing is not there  we are at two different places like you want to fix it  but there is not anything to fix  so is this our goodbye  i think so  that is devastating i know  my feelings are numb  i do not know how to feel right now  i feel like i am upset  gabby wants something that i do not know  if i can give her at this very moment  it is not that i do not want to  i would love to give that to her  but it is just something i do not know how i can do  within the next week  thank you for everything  mm thank you for being honest  i am just upset  i do not want to say goodbye  there goes my lady  stop  it feels like a little bit of a punch in the gut  because it was a fear  you know that i have had all along  and now it is kind of coming to fruition  which is i start to fall for someone  but they cannot meet me where i am or give me what i need  and it is scary as hell  saying goodbye to johnny was hard  but it is like kind of meant to be  because as much as like  i do not want to say goodbye to johnny  and like i know he will always have a piece of me  like i know there is something waiting for me  that is really great with erich and jason  i have been tired of fighting for love for a long time  and having it right in front of my face  is like so enlightening   in like the best way  this is obviously a big week yeah  one thing i do know that is real  is the connection between gabby and i  yeah  i feel like erich and jason have been really able  to validate me in a way that i did not know  like i could ask for  like it is just the feeling of being loved  that trumps all  so do you feel like you are falling in love with gabby  um i mean i would say  yeah not quite there just yet i would say  but i have strong feelings towards gabby  and yeah hopefully it turns into something real  after this  i am ready for an engagement  and it is not something that i really planned for  but i have seen myself progress with jason and erich  i did not know that i would get here  i did not know that i could feel this way  in such a short amount of time but i am hopeful  that i can leave here with someone  that i want to spend the rest of my life with  so you are at a point right now where you do not  feel like you are ready to get engaged to gabby  yeah do you think you could  get there before this is all over  right now like i am just kind of taking it day by day  and i want to be as honest and upfront as i can  and i would never want to hide anything from her  you know yeah  i mean truthfully like it is hard like in two weeks  like it is hard for me to see that  yeah it is just right now it is hard for me  to like get to the point of engagement  saying goodbye to johnny today was really difficult  and truly heartbreaking  this is the hardest week definitely  now i really am placing my hopes  on what i am feeling from erich and jason  but my heart is telling me that they are both ready  for the commitment to be together forever  and ready for an engagement  oh  i need to see you  i will be waiting on the bridge  i hear a knock at the door and there is a card  i do not know how to feel about this  i have no idea who wrote this note or why  and i truly do not know what to expect  my mind s kind of spinning and i know i should go  but i am a little scared  hi  i thought you were going to be my grandpa  sorry to disappoint you oh please  you know it is good to see you it always is  how are you i am good  i did not have anything to like tell you or anything  i just wanted to see you tonight  i was like i need to figure this out  i do have one thing i want to tell you  you know our last date  like the day part was amazing  the night part like i could not imagine that  going any better  and i am like now sitting here picturing the girl  that like i am in love with doing that with somebody else  like that kind of crushes me  and this is not going to be easy  but i just want to tell you how i feel because  i think i am having a really hard time  did not plan on telling you anything  but i just want to tell you where i am coming from  i do want to say that  yeah  i know  this is supposed to be positive  is it yes   this is a positive seeing you  yeah  this was not my intention  to put you on the spot or anything  i just wanted to tell you how i feel that is all  i think like in the spirit of being honest  like we talked about this off camera  what do you mean  like i feel like we were able to have  like an honest conversation about it in fantasy suites  so you brought me here to tell me it again  no this is not why i brought you here at all  i am  i do not know  i mean you do know  i feel so frustrated right now  erich expressed to me in the fantasy suite  that this week feels like i am cheating  and now i feel like we are rehashing the conversation  and i am being pressured  him being like i don t you to have  what we have with somebody else  well that is like not for you to say  you are here knowing that i could  have it with somebody else  i mean i do not know what is happened this week  but like i cannot just like pretend like  i am cool with everything and  i do not know like what you want to me to say  or like if you feel like i need  to prove something to you  because i think like i am always as like honest  and open as i can be  and if you want to get into it we can get into it now  i really do not  i did not want to put anything on you  and i am sorry this is not the way  i thought this was going to go  like i know where your heart is  and like i know like what you are trying to say  but like we did have this conversation  when it was just you and i  and like now i can talk to you about it  but then i feel like i would be defending myself  that is not the point at all  it was literally just to see you  but now that i see you i am like  i do not want to let you go  i do not know  it just does not feel good right now  why do i always have to defend myself  it is like why do not you trust what we have  it was not my intention to like  have any sort of ultimatum  or anything like that but i need you to know  how i feel because i cannot just like  go through this whole week being like everything s fine  i feel like he was testing me  and that is like not something you do  to someone that you love  maybe he is not going to be my guy after all  i am starting to question it  and i am terrified because what if i realize  that jason is not my guy either  now it is right in front of my face  my person might not be here  because it seems like the people  that i want to love me never do  it is just like coming crashing down  and i hope this does not end up in a big fat dumpster fire  but right now this feels like the end for me  i feel like i have like walls and barriers and  i do not know  tomorrow night on the bachelorette  i am having a lot of anxiety this week  i do have those fears of leaving here alone  after fantasy suite everything took like a  i felt blindsided  that was the last thing i could have ever expected  i do not necessarily know where we are  to feel this strong about somebody and know  that like you could lose that person  that is a horrible feeling  this whole time has been really hard  it does take kind of the right person  to know how to love me  i do not fully feel like i know who you are  gabby will not be joining you  you are going to be the only bachelorette here  i do not know what it is about me  that is so hard to love  i too broken for anyone to love  it all continues tomorrow night  i was so excited for this week  but i have been like dreading this week  yeah  i am just terrified that it is going to  we have a friend  oh my god he is actually fearless  i do not want him to bite my ankles  should we gave it champagne  oh my god he is going to jump   maybe i am not ready for a commitment like marriage  at this early of an age  well i will see you soon  bye beautiful bye  see you real soon see you later  i will see you soon  bye bye  and i was like don t worry about that  i m here for you  but then she got really adamant  like are you ready like are you sure  are you sure and i was like  are you making me like second guess  that was a surprise  it was like we were two strangers  i do not know what it could be  but rachel s concern came outta nowhere  and i think  it is to be honest  and she was putting on a front  that scares me  that scares me a lot  jesse zach  what is up man  can we talk uh yeah come on in  have a seat thank you  what is going on are you okay  excuse me  yeah take your time man  things are obviously taking a turn  yeah  to be honest i am completely lost right now  every moment that rachel and i shared  from the moment we met  to the moment we had our one on ones  i mean everything was just so easy fun  we clicked we had that connection  and things were immediately different  when we were in the fantasy suite  just completely the way we were together  you know that feeling  took like a and you know  she was different i was different  and the strange thing for me was you know  when the cameras were away and it was just her and i talking  it felt like she was just like not showing her true self  it was very unauthentic sometimes  like was it stuff she was saying  or was it like the tone of the conversation  her major concern was my age  and she was not sure if i was ready to commit  because i was  and you are and you are  she is  she is a couple months older  and uh you know  i kind of felt blindsided by that  you know with proposals around the corner  that was the last thing i could have ever expected  like i thought i saw my future you know with this woman  and  when i was there it was hard to rationalize you know  what was going on  and  i was praying because i thought i had something  i thought i saw this future with her  and just to be completely  gut punched and not feeling it at all  zach i am so sorry  because i know that is not what you were expecting  you know there were quite a bit of times where i was like  she could be my future wife  and you know you play it in your head and it is exciting  and you think that you know  this week is like the natural progression  to make that a reality  and i learned it was not  and uh it is shock  i am sad because there is feelings for her  but i need to figure this out as soon as i can  because we made it this far  and how am i going to recover from this you know  and i do not know  i do not know how to go about it right now  like she met my family  and they saw something  god i am sorry man it is all good  it is okay  sounds like you really care a lot about her  yeah what do you want to do  i need to tell her   and she needs to see this side of you  yeah  okay  tonight s the rose ceremony and uh it is tough because  rachel i know would love like  i mean i saw that woman as my future wife  but it is made me wonder like if  that is where her head s at with me  the only thing left to do is to talk to rachel  i need answers to accept the rose from rachel  i am going to whisper this once and only once  i am overwhelmed  going into this rose ceremony i am ready to be done  especially after overnights  erich is the only man i have left  i said goodbye to jason and johnny  i am still kind of upset and sad  and just processing exactly what happened  and how it affected me  and now it is right in front of my face  is my person might not be here  not because i do not want them to be  of course i do  i want to be loved for who i am  and i know i just have to continue to follow my heart  but now more than ever  i am scared that i could leave here alone  i do not have any idea how the rose ceremony s going to go  i know is that  my feelings towards rachel have not changed  i definitely you know i am falling in love with her  i love her as a person  i love the way that she makes me feel  and i want to be with her  i see myself with her in the future  starting life together getting married  having kids and starting a family all of that stuff  i see that with her  not getting a rose would be really hard  it is her not seeing a future with me  and seeing a future with two other people  and like i really do care for her a lot  and i do not want to like lose her  i am feeling very confident  about my relationship with rachel  my fantasy suite went so flawlessly  like i cannot imagine it having gone any better  it was perfection  but it is still rachel s choice  you know i know that she is really stressed  about how she was received by my family  it was pretty hard for her  i just see her as like my future  and like if she does not see that back  like that would be pretty like soul crushing  i am feeling sick to my stomach  tonight s rose ceremony feels  the complete opposite of what have gone into  every rose ceremony  i thought our connection was the most strong  hey zach hey jesse  how you doing man i am getting there  how are you feeling  um sadness kind of overwhelming  but before she gets the opportunity to offer roses  i would like to talk to her  you think you need that clarity  i think so all right  i wish you the best man  thank you jesse good luck  rachel made me feel special  and i felt like what we shared was real  felt like the love was actually forming and building  with her together  something that i was totally buying into  and  of that went away in one night  hey aven how we doing  good to see you again man good to see you  how you doing how is everything  good good it is been a fun week  what do you think the overnight date did  for your relationship together  i think it grew a lot  i think we were able to talk about some really good stuff  and spend some really good quality time  to just kind of be ourselves and it was amazing  and are you falling in love with her  i am falling in love with rachel  wow yes i know big  i am glad to hear you say that  wish you all the best tonight me too jesse  it is good to see you take care man you too   what is up  how are you doing man how you doing  oh yeah  cooking  tino what is up  how is it going how are you  not too shabby how about you  pretty good  you got a smile on your face  looks like someone is overnight date went pretty well  yeah it was really fun tell me about it  we took another gigantic leap  and me and rachel told each other  that we are in love with each other and it was amazing  so you are in love with her absolutely  stronger after the overnight portion for sure  really  that night in fantasy suite i mean the body language  the way that we both interacted  it felt like we were two strangers  we had like the most inauthentic conversation  i have ever had  i felt like i was not talking to the same rachel  i mean i am terrified right now  my heart s pounding out of my chest  i am not feeling okay  because i do have feelings for her  like that just will not go away  i have to salvage what i have  i need to tell rachel how i feel  hi jesse hello  how are you so good to see you  so good to see you you look great  you too you look amazing as always  thank you thank you  you got a beautiful smile  how is the week been  it has been so incredible  i just really had the best time with all three of these men  and a lot of clarity a lot of you know questions  hard questions but they definitely stepped up  right  and after this week you feel like  there is a proposal at the end of this for you  i really think there might be a proposal  i am hoping so  i am so happy to hear you say that  well there is something i do have to tell you  okay  gabby will not be joining you at this rose ceremony  you are going to be the only bachelorette here  okay all right  this rose ceremony really is all about you  and your relationships with your men  you forged your own path your own journey  and tonight is really about that  gabby s on her journey and you are on your journey  ah it is going to be so weird not having her here  but i am ready  i know you are  right well your men are anxiously waiting  all right thanks jesse  i know it is a big one good luck  bye  that was me i showed her who i was  i was more than ready to get on one knee  the rachel you know  that i was falling in love with  i trusted her you know  at least to show me her real her real self  and i do not think i got that  and i still do not know why or how  what was that rachel that i was getting  that is the biggest concern to me  so yeah i am upset  i cannot just be here and not share my feelings with her  because i need answers  hi guys  it is so good to see all of you  i just wanted to say that  i truly had the most wonderful week with all three of you  i am so thankful for you guys to be here  rachel can we speak  yeah okay  oh why the heck  oh my god  i am kind of still conflicted and nervous  but today i do know what i need to do  and i just need to find erich and really tell him how i feel  and lay everything out on the table  i am scared that the last conversation went awry  and that we cannot kind of get back to that  i do not want to play games  i think i have like worked really hard  and have been honest with myself and my feelings  but i have been waiting for the right moment  and this is so clearly the right moment  and now i am really not afraid to say  that i do know what i deserve   i am getting ready for the rose ceremony  and i am afraid that i might loser her  i am in love with gabby and this whole process  i have kind of misjudged from the start  how hard it is on her  i brought something up that  was not in the right place right time  and it is something we had already talked about  and for me to just still kind of harp on something  that was bothering me  i realize how insensitive that is  and i do not know what she is thinking  i am sweating and i am nervous and i am shaking  and i do not know what to do  right now like i am so scared  in the end i deserve being with someone  who is not afraid to love me  erich is the only man here  and i think that is what makes it more scary  i cannot tolerate any more pain  and i know walking away from him  would be what i need to protect myself  i do not know what is going to happen  i cannot predict anything  and i just am going to have to see how i feel  if it is my decision to leave here alone i know it is mine  hi  hi hi  how are you good  how are you good  surprised i was not expecting you  you were not no  oh this is your outfit  um how are you  i am good good  are you okay  i am just going to jump right in  yeah go ahead  um this week has like been so crazy  um and i think i have been learning so much about myself  literally every day and every week  and um i knew it would be hard everything  but i honestly did not know it would be this hard  and i have been making decisions  you know the situation  when like you and i were speaking last was like  did not i do not think go as planned  it was just hard i do not know  i think we were like misunderstanding each other  um and i think i was so upset because i was like  why doesn t he just like trust us  going into you know my date with jason  like i did just need more clarity  um and i know he is a private person  so i think we just needed time alone  um and having our date and our time together  it was the first time i was able to like  come around to what knowing what i deserve  but like i know in my heart that like you have fought for me  so much and you love in this very secure  and comfortable way  like you have taught me how like i wanted to be treated  and that is okay to like ask for those things  you know sometimes it is hard for me  to just like take things at face value  because of everything that i have gone through  but you have like taught me that it is okay  to feel safe and wanted and loved  in maybe a way that i have not  and you are the only one left  i know it is like so hard  and i think i have felt it for a while  but i do know that i love you  i love you  this is fricking amazing  i am so happy right now  that is the best feeling in the world  it is like i wanted was this  and then you get it and it is  i just could not be happier  and then anybody that i connect with like so easily  and like so deeply right off the bat  and then i got to know you more and like about who you are  and your family and past relationships  and your life has not been easy  and it is made you just like such an amazing woman  and i am so freaking lucky that it is you  i have been waiting so long to tell erich how i feel  he is been so vulnerable and confident and secure with me   he is the best thing that is ever happened to me  and it feels so right  i do have like so many feelings  i am able to get to this point  because you have always made me feel so safe  and i like honestly never gotten it before  it has like come from the past  and not just like with romantic relationships  but in some other ones  just having like to ask for those things  and you have never made me ask  i think i needed to like process and come to it  you know on my own terms for it to like make sense  because it is so foreign to me  i love you gabby  i am getting emotional okay  and honestly it feels like a fairytale  i just like cannot believe that he is all mine  there is no point in having a rose ceremony  and it is just you and me  i like the sound of that  me too  erich is definitely the love of my life  i think everything in my life has happened for a reason  and all of the arrows and the stars  are pointing straight to him  it feels so good and it feels so incredibly meant to be  i love you  i love you  i finally get to live what i thought  was only going to be fantasy  sometimes i am like pinch me  because it is way too good to be true  rachel can we speak yeah  uh um  his look when he asked her to walk out  he just looked like pretty upset  yeah interesting  i guess he kind of saw it as a now or never  hey jesse palmer here  i know look i know you are all expecting  to watch the end of that dramatic rose ceremony  in mexico right now and i know  you are all very anxious and eager to find out  what happens next but unfortunately  you are not going to see that tonight  and i am very very sorry for that  things have just been so emotional  they have been so dramatic for both gabby and rachel  that we felt it was right to take a moment  and to prepare ourselves for the shocking events  that are about to take place  events that are going to change both rachel s and gabby s lives  forever  so next week we will all watch  the most emotional finale in bachelorette history  and it is going to take place right here on this stage live  and we felt it was best to wait  until both rachael and gabby and their men could be here  to address all of the drama  and of course we will have our live studio audience  and you will all bear witness to the crazy controversy  that is about to ensue  so take some time and get yourselves ready  and prepare yourselves  for the most shocking finale of all time  here is a sneak peek  this is actually crazy  i do not want to do this anymore  gabby i want to leave here  for people who say that they care about me  to question my character it is really disappointing  this is straight up shattering everything  that you promised me  next week  breathe okay you are okay  the most emotional and unpredictable  season finale of all time begins  there is no way this works out  please just keep me out of this  let me out  we are literally about to be engaged tomorrow  to our dream guys  literally dreams  will gabby and rachel both find the love they so deserve  hi  i am like really thankful it is just us  you think he is ready to get down on a knee  yeah okay  i just love her i want the best for her  if you think you know what happens  we have a problem  guess again  he was unsure there would be an engagement  i think you should definitely kick him in the  you do not deserve this  you changed your story so many times i am done  i know that there is still somebody involved in this  why are you yelling at me   gets dms  but if he does look out  i want to circle back with you  i want to go back to that really  intense conversation you had  with aven when he told him he  was not sure if he could see  himself getting engaged you at  the end of all this and  understandably was very shocking  to you  what about that moment made you  so upset  walking in all i really  wanted for us to be on the same  page and to realize we were not  was really the hardest thing for  me  going into that final night  what were you hoping for  what doomed to hear from him  i do not know if i necessarily  needed to hear anything  i just needed to the see actions  with what he told me before  it seems like at this point  the relationship is on rocky  ground  maybe reaching the breaking  point  aven has one last shot  is he going to be able to turn  things around with rachel  let us find out  tonight is my last date  with aven  and i am extremely nervous  to see him again  because i was so confident  in aven and we had a full  overnight date together where  aven told me he is ready  for an engagement  but when he talked to my family  he told them something  different  and there was a point where i  was like i see my life with  aven  like aven is it  so i need to talk to him about  whether or not we are completely  on the same page  hi beautiful  hi  how are you  i am good  it is good to see you  thank you for coming  it is so good to see you  it is good to see you  how have you been  doing okay  i really missed you  i am so happy to see you  i have been looking forward to  today and obviously there is  some stuff that i want to talk  to you about  but like before kind of  getting into it do you want a  glass of champagne  let us just  do you want to just talk  i just feel like we need  you want to  yeah  absolutely  well i need you to know that  these last couple days for me  have been really hard  just from the pure fact of  like how i saw you the other  day when we had a conversation  i am so like deeply sorry  about making you feel like that  it really killed me to see you  like that  i never want to be the reason  why you cry or are upset over  anything  it really crushed me  and i know a lot of it is  because you might have felt that  that came out of nowhere and  i am truly sorry about that  and the next step in all of this  is so important to me  because i care about you  but you know realizing that i  want more time with you and i  want to come visit you in  florida and see where you live  i want you to come visit me  i want to do life outside of  this with you and i just feel  like that is so important for us  at this point before that next  step and i want us to be fully  fully in love with each other  so that is that point when we get  here is so special for us and we  can go right into a marriage and  start our family together with  our kids our two or four  however many you want  does that make sense so far  yeah  i think  i am sorry  i am just like struggling  like i hate the way we left  things really  and i need you to know i have not  stopped like thinking about  like how things were left  and like i need you to know  like how hard it is for me to  like walk in to my family and  be like  when aven says something to me  he means it and he would never  like lie to me  and i think the one thing i  wanted out of this was when you  sat down with my family that we  were on the same page  and i feel so blindsided by you  like i cannot even tell you  when i sat down with sam and   nate and they looked at me and  said you don t know where he is  at right now do you know how  that felt to me  because i thought when we talked  that night that we were on the  same page  i really like i think a  part of you is thinking that i  do not want this anymore and  that is not the case  i want to leave here with you  i want that more than anything  and i am sitting here trying to  fight for it  and i know that i might have  been  i do not know what it is caught  up a little bit in some of it  caught up  not in a bad way rachel  not in a bad way  i do not want that to come off  in a bad way  what does that mean  caught up  in saying that i thought i  might have been ready for this in  two weeks  but i am telling you that my  feelings towards you have not  changed at all and a life after  this is something that i want  with you  it really hurts to hear you  tell me one thing and then say  you got caught up in it with me  i did not mean for it  but i think you need to know  that like like i want to be  engaged  i want someone who is sure about  me and like i am not willing to  sacrifice that at the end of the  day  and i am having such a hard time  because like i feel like from  the beginning i have seen this  like with  like i can see this life with  you outside of this and i feel  like if this was any other  situation that it would be me  and you outside of this  but i am just not willing to  sacrifice that  like i need someone who is sure  about me and you are not sure  about me  i am sure about you  but i feel like you cannot  give me what i need right now  i want to give that to you  aven you cannot though  like i ultimately feel like i  just cannot like i cannot like  move forward  it is over  oh  i am so  rachel  i am sitting here telling you  that i  like i am never going to get  over this  this  i did not intend for this  to happen at all  i am so sorry  i just feel like my heart is  like breaking right now  like  i am sorry  i just want you to be happy  i want you to be happy  in all of this  can i give you a hug  yeah  i am so sorry rachel  do you want to walk me out  i failed  bye  i am so sorry  i am sorry  i have no idea where i am  going from here because i did not  think i was going to be leaving  here without rachel  i saw a life with her  and i will always think that if  i did something different  things would have been different  with us  forever   i am upset that i was not there  i know that we would have gotten  there  it is just really sad because  it is just like hard to know  it is over  i did see it being him and i  at the end  i am having too many of these  moments  like how much longer can i go  on this roller coaster  rachel i am sorry  i do not even know what to say  that was obviously completely  completely unexpected  i was watching you watch that  back and it seems like you are  still trying to process  everything that happened  yeah  i think there is really no words  to describe it  it is obviously hurts to watch  back  it still feels that way watching  it back again  i know this whole thing is  been suitably emotional for you  obviously  that might have been the most  emotion that we saw from you on  this journey  wheredo you think that was all  coming from  i mean everything i said is  exactly like what i was  feeling  i really did see him and i at  the end of it so it was really  hard to say goodbye  i can see the emotion on your  face  seems like you are fighting back  tears  is that true  is that how you feel  i am always fighting back  tears jesse  yeah that is true  gabby you have been supporting  each other on this entire  journey  i know how you been supporting  each other  how emotional was it for using  rachel go through all this  it is devastating just knowing  how much you went through  and being a good friend my  heart hurts when hers does  none of this is really easy  aven is here  he is backstage  do you feel like you are ready to  talk to him and hear what he has  to say  yeah  we will do that  when we come back rachel and  aven will go face to face is the  first time they broke up in  mexico  welcome back to the live  finale of the bachelorette  this entire journey has been a  massive roller coaster  obviously tonight is no  different  we are at that point now  everyone has just watched you  end things with aven  are you ready to see him  i am checking because you seem  nervous  are you sure  yeah  right ladies and  gentlemen please welcome aven  how are you  you look beautiful  it is so good to see you  rachel and aven it is great  seeing you both back here  together  i will start with you rachel  what is it like seeing aven for  the first time since that day in  mexico  it is really bittersweet  obviously but it is really good  to see you  it is good to see you too  pittsburgh i am sure you have got a  lot on your mind  what would you like to say to  rachel  yeah  i will miss sam s so nervous right  now  i have been very anxious to see  you  i think one thing that i want to  say is i am extremely extremely  sorry the way things ended  between us  i know that i hurt you  the way that things kind of  transpired i blindsided you  with everything that was not  fair  i cared about you too much to do  that to you  so i know i definitely feel like  i let you down in that moment   i am truly sorry  that is the first thing i wanted  to say  rachel was there anything  aven could have said or done to  salvage the relationship that  night when you saw him  it is hard because it is not  like anything went wrong  we never had a problem  at the end of the day you just  knew what was right for you  and that is okay  i do not know if there is anything  we could have done to salvage  it  we were being true to how we  felt in the moment and i respect  that  you are able to be honest with  me  absolutely  i think a big part of it too is  i just did not fully understand  what you needed and what you  wanted  that was on me  that was my fault  again i am sorry about that  as far as salvaging it i do not  know if we could have or not  we tried  but i agree  aven you seemed blindsided  when she ended things with you  that night  going into that night what were  you hoping  yeah obviously leaving you  that day on the bridge was to  tough  i was not feeling good about  where we are at obviously  i think that night i really just  wanted to reiterate to you that  i was not giving up on us  i wanted to continue with you  i wanted to continue our  relationship and move past and  move forward  but obviously kind of realizing  again that there was something  that you wanted between us  i am sorry that i was not there  i am sorry that we were not there  i felt like we were not there in  that moment  i was just hoping that we can  continue things  obviously we did not really see  eye to eye on that  rachel how do you feel about  that  i think it is all completely  understandable  at the end of the day you were  being honest with yourself and  it was obviously really hard to  hear because i thought we were  on the same page  but i appreciate your honesty  and you do not have to apologize  help us clear that up aven  obviously in the fantasy suite  you told rachel that you are  ready for an engagement but then  you met her family and her  friends and all of a sudden you  were not  what changed  what happened  yeah  i think kind of leading up to  meeting your family i kind of  just had some time and took a  look at where we were at where  i was at  i was really anticipating  meeting them because i wanted to  go up there and be as honest  with how i was feeling in that  moment towards the people that  mean the most to you  i just unfortunately did not get  the opportunity to tell you  first  which obviously was the downfall  to the whole thing  you know obviously that week  leading up i still did not  really know where you are at  with tino on the other side of  things so that weight on the a  little bit  ultimately i thought that we  could have gotten there  if we would have continued on  but i just did not get the  opportunity to kind of speak to  you before and i did not want to  not to be honest with your  family  i am sorry the way things  transpired  when you met her family and  you spoke to her friends do you  feel like her friends sabotaged  your relationship with rachel  absolutely not  they did not sabotage the  relationship at all  the questions they were asking  me were way forward up front  they a purpose  in that moment i wanted to be  honest about where i felt we  were at and i was at  yeah going back to you and  letting you know what i said and  everything like that  yeah i was just trying to be  honest with them when they were  asking those tough questions  your friends love you so  much  when you saw that back what did  you think  i asked those questions to  everyone  i feel like everyone is a tough  bunch  they really wanted to make sure  that he was ready nd that is  what they were doing  i do not think they were ever  trying to sabotage anything  absolutely not  aven obviously you and  rachel have been through so much  together  ups and downs when you look  back at this whole thing any  regrets  i mean yeah  i could have gone about  communicating to you about where  i was at a lot better  being able to have the  opportunity to speak to you  before that day obviously is a  big regret of mine  again just not taking enough  time to realize what you wanted  out of all of this  and what was important to you  it is something i regret because  i could have done a way better  job at that  i regret that deeply  rachel i know for you with  respect to aven none of this  happened because of a lack of   feelings  how hard is it for you now these  last couple months trying to  avoid the thoughts of what if  with aven  i think you can always go  back on what if  at the time he was doing what  was best for him  my feelings were always there  it just was kind of we were not  on the same page at the end of  the day and there is nothing  besides that  you are perfect  it was hard  cannot really look back  what about you aven  at the time you were saying you  were falling in love with  rachel  do you ever think about her and  wonder what could have happened  considering that the timing just  was not right  yeah absolutely  like i said that night i was  trying to fight for our  relationship where it was at at  that point  i wanted to continue  i was not giving up on you  unfortunately with the events  that happened and the way that i  went about things you just  did not agree  i think that is about timing  and aligning things  yeah  i wanted to continue with  everything  but i agree that maybe the  timing was off about where we  were at not being on the same  page  before we move on rachel i  will give you the final word  what would you like to say to  aven  i am really happy to see you  i really just wish you nothing  but the best  i really just unhappy that we  were able to have the chance to  sit down and talk  i feel like it was really  helpful  it is really good to see you  aven thank you so much for  being here  i know these things are always  very uncomfortable  thank you so much for being  honest  wish you all the best moving  forward  appreciate it  when we return gabby will be  back with us live on stage  erich  rachel has one guy left  that is tino  will these two men give these  incredible women the love they  so deserve  you are not going to want to  miss what happens next when the  live finale of  the bachelorette returns  welcome back to the live  finale of the bachelorette  i am here with gabby and rachel  two amazing women who have been  in this thing together from the  very beginning  it is been quite a surprising  night so far  so many twists and turns  and we are not done yet  not even close  we are over our allotted time  but what we are discussing is so  important  we have gotten special permission  from abc to continue this so we  are going to rejoin the  p m showing progress as  soon as we can  rachel i want to ask what has  it been like rehashing a lot of  stuff in front of a live  audience  very emotional  getting some good closure  hopefully can come out positive  gabby how about you  yes the same  it is always hard  hard for both of us  i am so grateful to have  rachael s support and to be here  for you  a lot of nervous energy  it is not just you  having you both here tonight  having you both here thank you  both so much  ms gabby  it is time for your final date  with erich  take a look  i am so excited to see erich  tonight  i have been thinking about him all  day  i just want to be wrapped up in  his arms again  i came here to find my person  and eric really has shown me  that he is it for me  hi  i love him because he makes me  feel safe  he makes me feel seen  and he just has everything that  i have ever looked for in someone  so i really really really  really really hope that he is  at the end of this proposing to  me and feels the same  you know if he was like i m  not ready i think that would  make me think like is it me  like is there something that  went wrong  are we not ready for each  other  it is like crazy that this is  our last day  and i do feel like more than  good about leaving here with   you  and that is scary for me to say  i am sure it is the same to hear  but i honestly came here like  not knowing what was going to  happen at the end  everything along the way like  some of my hardest goodbyes i  feel like have always led me to  you  so i do not know  i do not know  we have talked about a lot  i think this is it is like  insane to look back on  no honestly which is why  like i feel like i do not want  to put pressure on me or you  yeah  i think it is like i obviously  did not expect to ever be here in  this position or even like  stepping out of the limo night  one like looking back on it  now it s just like what in  the hell  like it is insane  and it was like from that  point i like i realized that  i was starting to fall for you  and it just kept getting like  more and more  i think that is kind of like  our relationship in the  beginning was like physical  and funny  and then i was like all right  i am going to take a risk and  just open up to this girl and  just give her like of me  and you matched me like every  step of the way which i know is  not easy to do  and for me it was not easy to  do either  it is been crazy  but i truly love you and i  do  i do want to spend the rest of  my life with you  and i do not want to rush  anything and i do not want there  to be any expectations or  anything that would not be  natural to us  i am telling you how much i love  you  i still have so many  qestions that i just hope i can  figure out because i do want a  proposal from him  and i am just looking for honesty  with him  i know like the truth if it is  not what i want to hear if he  says he is not ready to propose  it is going to hurt no matter  what  but i just want to know the  truth  i mean obviously i want to  leave here with you  i do  i know this is a big deal an  engagement and everything  i wish i knew better and i can  just be like this is  everything and i have been here  before and i know how to handle  the situation  but it is just i do not know  i feel pretty good about what  a life with you would be like  i hope it is like this  the last thing i want to do is  put pressure on you  but i do not i am not the one  proposing and that is why like  i do not know we kind of like  see maybe  but if we have to like listen  to ourselves  what does that mean see  i do not know  i really want us to work and i  know like i think all odds are  kind of working against that  but i just like i want to date  you  in the real world like  i want to date you  and it is  getting engaged before that  happens is that how things  usually go  yeah  i wanted was clarity  i am sorry if this has been  upsetting  i feel like i cannot really  talk about it  okay  he said i want to continue  to date you  so that does not scream  i want to propose  i do not want to force him  into a decision  this is actually crazy  i do not want to do this anymore  no i do not want anyone to be  forced just  like i am so sick of this  gabby  what is this  he is not ready  he just told me  he said i want to date you  that is what he said  when him and i were out on the  balcony he said i want to  leavehere and i want to date  you  i want to be with erich  forever  so i want him to propose  what am i supposed to do walk  away because he is not ready to  propose  so here we are big fat ']"
