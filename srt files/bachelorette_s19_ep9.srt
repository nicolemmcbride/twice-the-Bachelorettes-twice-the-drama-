1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:04,238
- Previously
on "The Bachelorette"...

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:05,339
- Welcome to New Orleans.

3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:06,907
My family's gonna love you.

4
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:09,142
Are they?

5
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,478
- Meeting families is huge.

6
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,180
If his family doesn't like me,

7
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:15,582
like, how is this gonna work
in the future?

8
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:18,585
- I just saw the chemistry
and I said to myself,

9
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:19,786
"She could be the one."

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,023
- That's a scary thing
to say itself.

11
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,326
- Best-case scenario,
they live happily ever after.

12
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,530
- I could never see myself
getting engaged.

13
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,165
Like, that's just not
something I could see

14
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,535
myself doing, at this point.

15
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,403
- I just have
a hard time believing

16
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,505
a whirlwind fairy tale trip

17
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,507
is really gonna prepare you
for marriage.

18
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,085
- I feel like I could be
the most perfect person,

19
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,386
and they wouldn't have liked me.

20
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,054
- I mean, you're saying
all the right things,

21
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,481
but I want to see him
fall for the right person.

22
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,883
- I don't know how I made it
out of that house alive.

23
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,452
I almost cried.

24
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,288
- And tonight...

25
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,757
- Whoo!

26
00:00:56,823 --> 00:01:00,127
- We're here in Mexico.
Bienvenidos.

27
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:03,163
And I am ready
to fall in love this week.

28
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,730
You good, Rach?

29
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,867
I fully expect to be
getting down on one knee

30
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:07,834
at the end of this.

31
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,169
I am in love with you, Gabby,

32
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,780
and I do not want to leave here
without you.

33
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,172
- You're so sweet.

34
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,275
- I'm just in shock
that we're at this point.

35
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,844
This is the moment
during Clayton's season

36
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,948
where everything went haywire,
everything went off the wall.

37
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,785
- It's really, really hard
to think about her

38
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,286
being on an Overnight.

39
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,155
It's gutting
to even think about.

40
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,190
- I'm, like, ready
to be engaged.

41
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,235
- Are you asking where I feel
with that whole thing...

42
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,469
- Yeah.
- 'Cause we have a week left?

43
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,795
- No pressure.

44
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,406
- You know, when you have
crazy feelings for somebody,

45
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,997
it's gonna hurt to know
that there are

46
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:39,399
other people still there.

47
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,277
It's not my intention to have
any sort of ultimatum

48
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,711
or anything like that,
but I can't just, like,

49
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,681
go through this week
being like everything's fine.

50
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,406
- I feel like
we were able to have,

51
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,575
like, an honest conversation
about it.

52
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,345
So you brought me here
to tell me it again.

53
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,839
There she is!

54
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,174
- Is that my two favorite
things, Rachel and champagne?

55
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,676
- Oh, my God!

56
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:23,877
- Hi!

57
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,579
- You look so beautiful.
- You too.

58
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,447
Oh, my God, it's so good
to see you in México.

59
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,517
- I know, we're here!
I can't believe it.

60
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,161
We have so much to celebrate
and talk about.

61
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,720
- Oh, my God. I know.

62
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,454
- First of all, cheers to you.

63
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,324
You look so beautiful.
- You do.

64
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:41,461
- And I'm just in shock
that we're at this point.

65
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,829
- Me too.
- Because I feel like

66
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,098
this is the point when
we were on Clayton's season

67
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,733
where everything went haywire,

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,202
like, everything
went off the wall.

69
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,871
- Yeah.
You know, this week is serious.

70
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,373
It's Overnights
with multiple men,

71
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,978
and being adult women
and looking for engagement,

72
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,446
like, it is something that

73
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,383
where intimacy, physical
intimacy, is something,

74
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,552
you know, that we need
to, like, figure out

75
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,888
and see if we're compatible
in that sense too.

76
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,024
But as much as I want to revert
back to, like,

77
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,260
"Let's play, let's giggle,

78
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,728
let's, like, chase each other
around naked"...

79
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,399
- Well, we could
still do that, but...

80
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,235
- Yeah, but I know
I'm gonna have to, like,

81
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,772
flip it into, "But we do
have to utilize this time."

82
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,541
- Right.
To be honest, like,

83
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,143
I have been,
like, dreading this week.

84
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,212
- Yeah.
- Because of what happened

85
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,914
with Clayton...
- Mm-hmm.

86
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,316
- I have been so scared
to be honest with them

87
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,886
because of how he made me feel
in that moment

88
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,922
when he stood in front of us
and he was like,

89
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,091
"Not only am I intimate
with both of you,

90
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:45,225
"I'm love with all of you.

91
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,660
I'm in love with Susie."
- Yeah.

92
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,428
- And just the general disregard

93
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,430
for everyone's feelings
but his own.

94
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:53,667
- You know, I thought the way
that he told me he loved me

95
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,335
and the way
that we were interacting,

96
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,737
I'm like, "It's me."
- Exactly.

97
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:57,871
- And that's when, like...

98
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:59,805
That's where my pain
came from is,

99
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,708
I almost felt
like I was manipulated.

100
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:02,809
- Yes.

101
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,745
- So I never want
to make anyone else

102
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,447
feel the way that we did,
but that's kind of...

103
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,015
Where are you at with your guys?

104
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:13,086
- With Tino, I feel like
he was the first one

105
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,656
that I knew had
really strong feelings for.

106
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,158
- Yeah.
- It's never changed.

107
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,893
It's really only gotten better.

108
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,827
There's so many things
about Tino

109
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,298
that I can see myself
being with forever.

110
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,100
But I do obviously
have to talk about

111
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,277
what happened with his Hometown.

112
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,436
- Yeah.

113
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,605
- Because his family
weren't accepting of me.

114
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:32,915
- Yeah.
- And I don't know if it's,

115
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,107
they're just against the fact

116
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,909
that this is so not traditional

117
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,645
and that's maybe what
they wanted for him,

118
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,313
and this just isn't that,

119
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,483
but, I mean, Tino is an adult,
he's making his own decisions,

120
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,787
and he finally told me
he's falling in love with me.

121
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:50,056
Which was so important to me.
I was freaking out.

122
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,734
Like, I didn't know
how I'd get through this week

123
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,692
if he didn't tell me.

124
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,693
- Yeah.

125
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,961
- And he did tell me,

126
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,130
so I'm really happy
that he did that,

127
00:04:57,197 --> 00:05:00,567
but I just really, I think,
ultimately want clarity

128
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,804
with myself because I don't
have a decision right now.

129
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,005
- Mm-hmm.

130
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,108
- And with Zach,
every single piece is there.

131
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:11,711
Zach has never left me
in the dark with how he felt.

132
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,980
He was the first one to
tell me he was falling for me.

133
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,483
He is so incredible.

134
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,252
He is funny and he's a gentleman

135
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,388
and he is vulnerable
and emotional

136
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,658
and just able to connect
in a different way.

137
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,761
But I don't think
I'm there with Zach.

138
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,263
And this is getting
days away from an engagement.

139
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,066
I want to use the time

140
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:36,203
to really be honest
with myself and with him...

141
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,804
- Yeah.
- To see if I can get there,

142
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,640
because like you said, we have
to be honest with them.

143
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,343
But everything is
so perfect on paper.

144
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,578
- Yeah.

145
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,947
Wait, okay,
so who are you bringing first?

146
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,115
- Aven.

147
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,217
- Wow.

148
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,985
Look at this.

149
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,687
- I think immediately with Aven,

150
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,022
we really had
this great foundation

151
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,891
and we just continued
to build on it.

152
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,058
- Yeah.

153
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,436
- We have
that romantic connection

154
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,595
and that physical connection

155
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,598
and he's able to be
so honest with me,

156
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:08,168
and every single he says,
I 100% believe.

157
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,537
I'm a little nervous
because I haven't

158
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,005
told Aven how I feel yet.

159
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,007
- Yeah.
Like, what are you feeling now?

160
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,576
- I feel like I'm falling
in love with Aven, for sure.

161
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,813
And he told me he was
falling in love with me

162
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,482
during his Hometown,
but I didn't say it back.

163
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,950
I was just kind of at the point

164
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,054
where I was still really scared
because of what happened

165
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,389
on the season with Clayton.

166
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,690
- Yeah.

167
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,435
- I don't want Aven
to feel like that as well,

168
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,028
so I want to get
that fear behind me.

169
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:39,266
And I really want
to tell him how I feel,

170
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,868
but I'm so nervous about it.
- Aww.

171
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:46,306
- So what do you honestly need
with your time with Jason,

172
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,775
and, like, how do you feel
right now?

173
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:51,711
- We just have, like,
a special connection

174
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,089
that I feel like
I've never really

175
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,681
felt with anyone before.

176
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,251
He's always been the most
kind of emotionally available

177
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,519
to me.

178
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,330
- Do you feel like you're
falling in love with him?

179
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,823
- I think I'm definitely
falling in love with him,

180
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,894
but I don't actually know
how he feels about me.

181
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,797
I feel like
I have to just let him know

182
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,166
exactly what I need, and then...

183
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,401
- I think you deserve it.

184
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,503
You deserve
to know how he feels.

185
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,804
- Yeah.

186
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,806
- How do you feel about Johnny?

187
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,008
- Johnny and I do have
so much fun together

188
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,444
and I have watched him
grow so much.

189
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,813
I think, unfortunately,
we could be

190
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,348
in two different places
in our lives

191
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,717
where I'm very ready for
an engagement and marriage,

192
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,952
and he's not.

193
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,587
But I can see the growth
in him as a person,

194
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,423
so he could really surprise me.

195
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,791
- Right.

196
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,427
So, wait, how are you feeling
going into tonight?

197
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,162
I know you've already told Erich

198
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,698
that you're falling in love
with him.

199
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,499
- I love how playful
we are together.

200
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,901
We have good banter.

201
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,470
Our relationship has grown
so much

202
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,472
over last Hometown week,

203
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,908
and I told him I was
falling in love with him

204
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,276
because it's true.

205
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,578
And I didn't realize
that I needed

206
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,481
to hear that until he told me.

207
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,717
But, you know,
we're going into this week

208
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,452
having feelings
in a certain way,

209
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,354
but they can definitely change.

210
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,922
- And we're really
gonna have to use

211
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,424
every single second of the time
we have left

212
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,961
to really make a decision
that's best for us.

213
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,764
- Yeah, I think
this week is gonna be

214
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,199
unreal, transformative.

215
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,368
- We get to rewrite
what this week means.

216
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,535
- Yeah.

217
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,504
- And make it
into something positive

218
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,107
and ending with an engagement
for both of us.

219
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,975
- I'm so excited.

220
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,442
- And chase each other around
naked.

221
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,315
This is the most important week
of my whole journey.

222
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,816
- Let's get on
with our big days...

223
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,952
- I know. Let's go.
- And ever bigger nights.

224
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,054
- Bigger nights.

225
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:44,124
And I'm so excited
to see my guys this week.

226
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,427
Because it is just
absolutely gorgeous here.

227
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,062
Beaches. The jungle.

228
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,264
Literally the perfect place
to fall in love.

229
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,103
- I'm so excited.

230
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,471
I love it here.

231
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,906
I love the warm weather.

232
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,274
Rachel and I are going

233
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,942
on our first Overnights
this week.

234
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:06,046
It is so exciting
because I can see myself

235
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,782
potentially being engaged
with one of my men.

236
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,684
So there's a lot
riding on these dates.

237
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,755
And this is the perfect place
for me to end my journey.

238
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,825
Not just because
it's beautiful and tropical,

239
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,560
but also because I'm ready.

240
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:21,995
I know what I want.

241
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,364
I am ready
to fall in love this week

242
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:28,168
and to hear the words
"I love you, Gabby."

243
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,536
I can't wait.

244
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:33,306
I feel excited, hopeful,
ready for the future.

245
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,641
Let's get it started.

246
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,823
- Today's my first
Overnight date,

247
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,125
and I'm excited to spend
the day with Erich.

248
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,361
We've grown so close
after last week.

249
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,631
Erich and I had
such a good Hometown,

250
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,534
which was really
a huge stepping stone for us

251
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,838
because I saw
his emotional side.

252
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:08,475
His dad has been
battling cancer.

253
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,212
I truly can't imagine
how hard it is on Erich,

254
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,081
but seeing his family
and how much they mean to him

255
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,151
just show
what a good person he is.

256
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:21,488
And that night, we shared
that we were falling

257
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,789
in love with each other,

258
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:26,993
and I'm still just reveling
in that bliss.

259
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,695
Bienvenidos.

260
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,437
How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

261
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,105
- It's good to see you.

262
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,840
- It's good to see you too.

263
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:44,277
This?

264
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,047
I've never met anyone
like Erich in the way

265
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,550
that we feel together
and around each other.

266
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:54,087
Okay, let's go.

267
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:58,758
Like, this is actually
our first date without family.

268
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,394
But this week could be
the most important week

269
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,063
even in the weeks to come
because there is

270
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,732
an Overnight date tonight.

271
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:10,703
It's the only time
we get uninterrupted time

272
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,372
alone, truly alone.

273
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:16,609
So today, I want him
to treat me like a girlfriend,

274
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,579
like a potential fiancée.

275
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:23,183
Because I think Erich and I
do have physical chemistry.

276
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,685
And I'm really
looking forward to seeing

277
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:28,955
where it goes tonight.

278
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,524
Yo.

279
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,726
- Is this water?
- Yeah.

280
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,528
- Yeah.
- Do you know what that means?

281
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,565
"Salto de Los Enamorados."

282
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,866
Take off your clothes.

283
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,968
Oh, gladly.

284
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,003
- I mean, it doesn't,
but you can.

285
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,606
- Okay.
- But this is the lovers' leap.

286
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:47,807
- Hell yeah.
- Yeah.

287
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,609
- Let's do it, like, right now.
- Yeah.

288
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,544
No, wait, hold on.

289
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,513
Have you jumped
off of things before?

290
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,881
- I have.

291
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,883
- You're gonna have
a lot of fun.

292
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,351
This is a cenote.

293
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:01,621
It's like a natural hole
in the ground in a jungle.

294
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:04,057
So should we jump?
- Yes!

295
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,059
I'm feeling absolutely amazing.

296
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,271
Gabby and I have had
such a crazy connection

297
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,230
this whole time.

298
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,531
And last time I saw her,

299
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:12,808
I told her I was
falling in love with her.

300
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,767
So we basically
crossed the threshold

301
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,336
where our relationship
kinda just took

302
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,137
this, like, crazy leap.

303
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,472
You ready?
- Ready.

304
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,874
- Go!
- No!

305
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,782
Oh, my God, that's actually
higher than I thought.

306
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,685
- But dating Gabby,
it hasn't been, like,

307
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,821
really easy to be honest
because there are

308
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,322
still two other people here.

309
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,991
So there's a possibility

310
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,626
I might not be the one for her.

311
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,928
- Whoo!

312
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:44,097
No!

313
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,231
- That's the risk for me.

314
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,000
That's the thing
that I think about,

315
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,468
you know,
in the back of my mind.

316
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,871
But at this point, I'm willing
to throw myself at her.

317
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,240
Kind of have to take
a leap of faith.

318
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:57,210
Because she is
so freaking worth it.

319
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,978
- It feels good
being in the water, though.

320
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,346
- Yeah, it's really nice.

321
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,148
- Now I want to do the high one.

322
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,250
I don't know if I can do it.

323
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,554
Okay, you go look.

324
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,831
- A little tall, not gonna lie.

325
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:13,826
- Yeah.

326
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,628
- You want to just do it?
- No.

327
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,174
- I think what it is
is just one step out.

328
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,133
- Oh, God.

329
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,101
Oh, I'm afraid.

330
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,875
- You got this.

331
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:33,780
- So just one step

332
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,315
- Literally one step.

333
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,856
- Standing here thinking
about making this jump,

334
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,025
it's a lot like falling in love.

335
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:50,396
It's a huge leap of faith
and it's very intimidating.

336
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,300
- Yep, you got it down.

337
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,768
You got this.

338
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,769
You got this.

339
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,006
- Oh, I'm so scared.

340
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,241
I don't want to make
a big deal out of it.

341
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,077
I know we're trying to have fun.

342
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,914
And my heart is telling me
to leap, but it's so scary.

343
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,551
Maybe you go first.

344
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,820
- I want to go with you.
I'm gonna jump when you jump.

345
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,490
I'm not jumping without you.

346
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,461
- You know,
throughout this whole journey,

347
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,329
one of my biggest
fears has been,

348
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,798
will I be accepted for who I am?

349
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,901
I think I'm too scared.

350
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:34,040
You got this.

351
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,577
But I have to remind myself

352
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,979
how loving and supportive
Erich has been

353
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,414
every time we're together.

354
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,415
- You can do it.

355
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:44,717
- And right now,

356
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,619
he's definitely doing it again,

357
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,355
trying to give me courage
to take the leap.

358
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,924
And he does make me feel
really safe.

359
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,529
- Deep breath, deep breath,
and then you go.

360
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,101
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

361
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,704
Don't think. Just go.

362
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,606
Whoo!

363
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,646
Okay.
- Yeah.

364
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,751
Whoo!

365
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,087
- I'm not always
the most adventurous.

366
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,322
- Yeah! Whoo!

367
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,025
- But jumping
off of the highest landing

368
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,060
was really incredible.

369
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:32,532
And having Erich's support
makes it so much easier.

370
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:37,136
It makes me feel so loved
and that we can do

371
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:40,306
lots of hard things together.

372
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,709
And, honestly, that's what
I want in my husband.

373
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,860
Cheers to a great day.

374
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:04,497
- Cheers. Cheers for jumping.

375
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,299
- I wouldn't have been
so freaked out

376
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,268
if I, like, would've went
faster, but...

377
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,612
- You did it.
That's all that matters.

378
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,271
- Yeah.

379
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,341
- I feel like the last time
I saw you was so long ago.

380
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,576
- Me too.

381
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,153
I was really looking forward
to seeing you,

382
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,946
especially after, like,

383
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,614
how good our date was
with your family.

384
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:22,748
- Yeah.

385
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,750
I felt, like, so good
leaving there.

386
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,586
Like, it wasn't
an easy day, obviously.

387
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,187
- Yeah.

388
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,556
- But, like, I really
wanted you to be there.

389
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:31,900
I knew it wasn't gonna be
easy for me to, like,

390
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,226
make it through that day.
- Yeah.

391
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,261
- To see my dad, and, like,
I told you afterwards,

392
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,239
like, he's not... he's really not
doing that well.

393
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,474
- Yeah. I'm so sorry.
- And, like, being there

394
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,200
and then leaving quickly
was just like, damn.

395
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,002
- I know.
I didn't want to leave.

396
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,746
- And then to sit there and,
like, watch you drive away,

397
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,215
it was, like, so dramatic
and I was like, damn.

398
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,573
- I know. It was.

399
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,343
- I'm, like, getting emotional.
- Aww.

400
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,378
No, I know I always say,
like, thank you,

401
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,780
but really it means, like,
so much that you're here,

402
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,518
and I think seeing your family
put everything in perspective,

403
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,887
and so I understand
how hard it is for you

404
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,455
and how hard it must be.

405
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:07,359
So I hope you know how much
I do appreciate you.

406
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:11,664
And I didn't know that I needed
to, like, hear how you felt,

407
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,766
but it was so good to hear.

408
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,401
And I do,
I feel like it brought us,

409
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:18,436
like, so much closer,
just, like, everything.

410
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,339
- Yeah, I appreciate that.

411
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,943
Being here is not easy,

412
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,187
but it's, like,
moments like this

413
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,579
that I'm like,
"I, like, need to be here.

414
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,814
I need to be here with you."

415
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,625
- Today with Erich
was definitely as good

416
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,661
as I hoped, maybe even better.

417
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,930
I mean, it's always
felt easy with Erich,

418
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,831
but I feel like
there were moments

419
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,834
where he was able to really
support me as a true partner.

420
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,805
I love being wrapped around him.

421
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,240
I love when he holds me.

422
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,909
I love kissing him
in the middle of the cenote.

423
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,911
I feel like
I didn't want it to end.

424
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,147
- Now we're here and this has
to last forever now,

425
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,583
so I'm not leaving.

426
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,118
- I'm so happy.

427
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,154
Going into tonight's dinner,

428
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,755
I'm excited for us to really lay

429
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,290
everything out on the table.

430
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,825
The more time
I spend with Erich,

431
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:16,195
the easier it is for me
to really see my life with him.

432
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,868
I think tonight will
really help with that.

433
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,272
We know we're at that point
in our relationship,

434
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,908
and I think it could be
just what I need

435
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,711
to really see myself
engaged to him

436
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,980
and, you know,
at the end of this.

437
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,983
I just want to crawl inside you.

438
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,062
- You do look unbelievable.

439
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,564
- Oh, my gosh, thank you.

440
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,735
Being with Erich
today was amazing.

441
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,638
It was easy and natural

442
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,507
and comfortable and so much fun.

443
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,377
I felt really connected to him.

444
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,545
And tonight, there's a potential

445
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,648
to spend the night together.

446
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,783
So I'm excited.

447
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,620
Tonight, I want to push us

448
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,622
into being honest
with our feelings.

449
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,290
I know it's scary
as hell and I think,

450
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,493
honestly,
the Overnight portion of it

451
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,362
is where it becomes
the most real.

452
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,531
Isn't it cute?

453
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:28,801
But before we commit
to that, you know,

454
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,836
I need to know where he stands.

455
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:34,573
Will he be able to give me
unconditional love

456
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,942
and accept me for me?

457
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,978
- I'm taking this jacket off.

458
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,080
- I like
how you leave it unbuttoned.

459
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:44,150
So I'm hoping
that tonight with Erich,

460
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:48,854
I can be all the different
sides of myself in one breath.

461
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,658
- I was really looking forward
to seeing you.

462
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,293
Thinking that Hometown
was not easy.

463
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,494
- Yeah.

464
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,663
- And then to see you today,
I was like,

465
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,410
"We finally have this time,
like, just us."

466
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,209
Like you said, there's no
family involved for once.

467
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,577
I was like, "This is
actually gonna be amazing."

468
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,012
And then next thing you know,
we're doing something

469
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,356
that I really freaking like
to do,

470
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,339
which is scare myself.
- Yeah.

471
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,775
- And to see you scared too,
I was like, "This is perfect."

472
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,121
- Well, I didn't want to make
a big deal out of it,

473
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,947
and then it became a big deal,

474
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,717
but I feel like
you were, like, so supportive

475
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,752
and so patient with me.

476
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,821
And I really appreciate that.

477
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,255
- Yeah.

478
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:34,633
I think after our Hometown
and, you know,

479
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,812
seeing you with my family,
I could not have expected it

480
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,037
to go as well as it did.

481
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,706
And the thing
that I didn't tell you

482
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:44,443
was that my family is obsessed
with you.

483
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,079
And I just could not
have imagined...

484
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,681
- And I them.

485
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,916
- I can... I'm not up there
being like, "Wow,

486
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:54,754
this is freaking amazing," but,
like, to hear that from them

487
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,531
is, like, the ultimate
validation to be like,

488
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,957
"This girl is amazing."

489
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,593
And I'm just so ridiculously
attracted to you

490
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,429
and I couldn't wait
to see you after that.

491
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:06,098
- Definitely, like, walking in,

492
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,834
I think I had to get
my bearings and stuff too,

493
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:12,471
but after a second,
it was, like, so easy,

494
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:13,839
like, with your dad,

495
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,741
with your mom,
and with your sister.

496
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:19,178
They, I think,
welcomed me so much

497
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:21,914
to where I can really
see myself as a part

498
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,150
of your family, and it...

499
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27,653
I think I've probably told you
a little bit about it,

500
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,258
but my growing up was

501
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,659
just really different

502
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:37,196
in that my parents,
like, separated early

503
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:40,699
and my dad was still
active duty in the Air Force,

504
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,501
so he moved away.

505
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,336
For a lot of years,
I would just see him

506
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,838
for Christmas and summers.

507
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,410
And my mom was working two jobs,

508
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,280
and they had us real young,

509
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:58,617
so I did a lot
of growing up on my own.

510
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,987
And, like, there were times
growing up

511
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,923
when I did have to change
who I was

512
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:08,828
in order to receive love
as a child.

513
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,162
- Yeah.

514
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:13,132
- And my mom and I don't
really have a relationship,

515
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:16,101
but I know she did
the best she could growing up.

516
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,638
It's just kind of complicated
and messy.

517
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:24,043
But looking at your family,
it's like...

518
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,911
It's so nice to see,

519
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:29,415
you know, you guys
really are a whole,

520
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,183
not, like, parts of a whole.

521
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,718
- Yeah. Yeah.

522
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:37,857
As hard as it is, I mean,
I can respect so much about you

523
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:41,293
and knowing where you came from
and how, like, strong you are

524
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,362
and how emotionally intelligent
you are

525
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,629
and how you handle situations.

526
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,565
Like, I just...

527
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:48,834
I don't know, I can't imagine

528
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,045
going through
what you've gone through

529
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:53,806
and you turned out
so amazing that...

530
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,174
You're a beautiful person.

531
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:57,176
- Aww.

532
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:59,812
Thank you.

533
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,516
So...

534
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,019
Like, last week,
you know, I told you

535
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:10,122
I was falling in love with you
and we left Europe

536
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,724
and I was, like,
falling for you,

537
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,392
and then I watched you leave
in that SUV

538
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:16,095
and I was just like,
"This is when it starts

539
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,932
to really hurt," when you
have to, like, get torn apart

540
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,301
and I don't get to see you
again for however long,

541
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,936
and I don't know how long it is.

542
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,639
So I spend that time in between
just thinking about us

543
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,607
and how much this relationship
means to me

544
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:30,776
and how much I hope
it means to you.

545
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,778
And I'm kind of past the point

546
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,365
where it's like,
"I'm falling for you."

547
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,748
"I'm falling in love with you."

548
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,058
Like, I am love
in with you, Gabby,

549
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:41,253
and I do not want
to leave here without you.

550
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,088
- You're so sweet.

551
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:52,264
I do really see
a future with you.

552
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:54,333
You have a way
of making me feel, like,

553
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,201
really safe, no matter what.

554
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,637
And I really, really
appreciate you.

555
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:02,408
And, like, I am
falling in love with you.

556
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,642
I really am.

557
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,326
I feel like I'm weightless.

558
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,362
Like, the happiest person
in the whole world.

559
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,900
When Erich said
that he was in love with me,

560
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,202
it felt so right.

561
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,406
It means a lot. It really does.
- I know.

562
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,349
- He's taught me so much
about myself

563
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,417
and that I can be loved

564
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,487
and that he's ready
to love me for me.

565
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:51,256
I'm just so excited to be
falling in love with him

566
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,460
and to share it with him.

567
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,029
There's something for you.

568
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,697
It's a surprise.

569
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,099
- Okay.

570
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:06,071
"Gabby and Erich, love is
really a leap of faith.

571
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:08,273
"Hopefully, you both
felt that today

572
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,951
"out in the beautiful
Mexican countryside.

573
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,477
"If you choose to take
this next leap,

574
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:14,179
"please use this key to stay as
a couple in the Fantasy Suite.

575
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,581
Jesse."

576
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,216
- What do you think?

577
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,818
Obviously yes.

578
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:26,291
I'm so happy right now.

579
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,926
You know, I am in love
with Gabby

580
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,995
and, you know, I told her
that I love her,

581
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,865
and for me it was a huge weight
lifted off my chest.

582
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,333
- Thank you.

583
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,769
- And now I get the most
meaningful time with her,

584
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:37,836
with just us.

585
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,838
Like, I'm just so excited.

586
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:51,650
- Being loved by Erich
just feels really incredible.

587
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,953
It's what I've been
waiting for for so long.

588
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,424
I just want to hold on to it
for as long as I can.

589
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,660
Oh, my God, it's big.

590
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:05,964
We finally get to, like, revel
in each other and be together.

591
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,733
Oh. Oh, is there a hot tub?

592
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,234
Oh, dear God.

593
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,103
Oh, my God.

594
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,538
This is insane.

595
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:16,175
So I want to shed
every last wall.

596
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:22,281
- This is really nice.

597
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,516
- I want to give both of us
the chance

598
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,453
to really feel
each other's love.

599
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,626
When I'm with him,
like, I want to be with him

600
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:38,163
and I can see myself
with him forever.

601
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,798
And every time we kiss,

602
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:42,668
the world really does melt away.

603
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:46,572
And for once,
I feel like the future

604
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,408
is gonna be so, so good.

605
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,428
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

606
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,604
All right, make some breakfast?

607
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,535
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you gonna make me cook?

608
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:18,670
- No, I feel like I should cook.

609
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,039
- Waking up this morning,
it was amazing.

610
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,709
You know, we spent this
incredible night together.

611
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:27,279
I got to just see the raw Gabby
and have conversations,

612
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,948
and she is everything and more
than what I thought.

613
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,384
She is, to me, a person
I'm obsessed with.

614
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:34,520
- Am I doing this wrong?

615
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,789
100% yes.

616
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,259
And it's, like, mind-boggling
that I had the opportunity

617
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,636
to spend the night with her
and have

618
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,464
this, like, crazy
off-camera experience.

619
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,432
You know, I've thrown
myself out there 100%

620
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,601
and told her that I love her,

621
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,472
and for me that's, like...
That's all of me.

622
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,342
So going into the rest
of this week,

623
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,444
I'm gonna try not to think
about everything.

624
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,079
I mean, the reality is, it sucks

625
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,081
that there are
other relationships happening.

626
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,619
I love spending time with you.

627
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,154
- This was sad.

628
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,824
- I know thinking
about things like her

629
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,060
in, you know, the Fantasy
Suites with these other guys,

630
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:16,404
it's just not gonna
be healthy for me.

631
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,563
I know how I get.

632
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,364
I get really in my head,
and I'm not,

633
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,266
like, a super jealous person,
but, you know,

634
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,101
when you have
crazy feelings for somebody,

635
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,836
it's gonna hurt to know
that there are

636
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,572
other people still there.

637
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:29,708
- Do you know how I feel?

638
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,810
- Confused.

639
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,712
- You think I'm confused?

640
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:34,780
- I think I'm confused.

641
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,583
- Why?
- I don't know.

642
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,251
- What do you mean?

643
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:42,921
I feel like you know

644
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:46,325
that just being with you
is so easy.

645
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,397
And it does,
it feels like I've known you

646
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,633
for so much longer than I have.

647
00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:00,038
Waking up this morning
with Erich, I feel...

648
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:05,244
I don't know. A lot.

649
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:08,814
Are you gonna miss me?

650
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,717
- I'm so gonna miss you.
I'm gonna cry in the shower.

651
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:16,255
- I am definitely

652
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,357
more than falling in love
with Erich.

653
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,492
I really think I am
in love with him,

654
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,363
and I know he deserves to know,
but I know how strong

655
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,232
those words are, and I want
to be able, honestly,

656
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,801
to tell just one person
at the end of this,

657
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,938
and I can definitely
see it being him,

658
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:36,241
but I know I have to save it
for the right moment.

659
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,345
I hope you know
I don't want to let you go.

660
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,150
- I believe you.

661
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,489
I'm here.
- I know.

662
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:51,795
And I know what you're feeling,

663
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:55,127
and I know it's not,
like, okay, but...

664
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,933
Please just be patient with me.

665
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,605
I mean, undeniably,
when I'm with him,

666
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,140
like, I want to be
with him and I can

667
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,075
see myself with him forever.

668
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,111
And I hope
that that feeling holds up,

669
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,881
but I'm scared that it won't.

670
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:19,184
- I'll miss the hell out of you.

671
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:22,020
- I'll miss you more.

672
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:24,323
- I'll see you soon?
- Yeah.

673
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,590
- Okay.

674
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:32,097
- I have a pit in my stomach.

675
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:35,701
I get up nerves on what you're
gonna do when you walk away.

676
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,167
- I'm just gonna keep walking
all the way back to New Jersey.

677
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,508
- I didn't want to say goodbye.

678
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:44,886
I wanted to spend
the whole day with him,

679
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,745
so I know my heart's
in the right place,

680
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:49,448
but there is also
just this heaviness of,

681
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,717
I have more work to do on myself

682
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,685
and the other men that are here.

683
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:55,552
You know, what if I have
this same exact thing

684
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:56,521
with somebody else?

685
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:57,889
And then what?

686
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,791
You too.

687
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,159
- I'll see you soon.

688
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,228
- I want to be able
to say, you know,

689
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:06,598
I want to be engaged to him
because I know it's him,

690
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:07,999
but I don't know.

691
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,968
- Bye, Gabby.
- Okay.

692
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,436
Bye.

693
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:15,073
I'm gonna throw up.

694
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,211
- Bye.

695
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:20,688
You know, I almost didn't
want to leave,

696
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,648
but, you know, one thing
she said is, "Just be patient.

697
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,217
I'm here for you,"
but, you know,

698
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,652
this is incredibly painful

699
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,688
because what if she's falling
in love

700
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:31,256
with Johnny and Jason as well?

701
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,535
It's hard to think about that.

702
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,395
So I'm taking her advice

703
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,130
and I'm not gonna get emotional.

704
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,965
I'm not gonna cry
in the shower anymore.

705
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,434
I'm just gonna be patient
and look forward

706
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:45,771
to the next time I see her,
and hopefully it's soon.

707
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,188
- This week is really hard.

708
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,123
I know I'm falling
in love with Rachel.

709
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,026
And it's so hard
feeling this strongly about her

710
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:11,730
knowing she's on an Overnight
with one of the other guys.

711
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:14,399
It's just beyond me
at times that, like,

712
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:18,570
she's, like, even exploring
other physical connections.

713
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,906
I can't imagine her
wanting to spend

714
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,441
the night with anybody else.

715
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,775
This is just torture.

716
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:25,977
It's like being
in the Twilight Zone.

717
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:29,014
Even just talking about it now
makes me want to throw up.

718
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,119
- Hi.
- Hi.

719
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:39,357
I missed you.

720
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,159
Hi.
- I missed you too.

721
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:42,160
It's so good to see you.

722
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:43,304
- It's so good to see you again.

723
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,639
- You look beautiful!
- Thank you.

724
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,431
- My gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

725
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:49,367
Well, I have
such a fun date planned.

726
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,203
You know,
the water is really blue,

727
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,305
so I figured we should
check it out together.

728
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:54,706
What do you think?
- I'm so in.

729
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,117
I want to do whatever today.
- Are you excited?

730
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,409
- I'm so excited.

731
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,745
- I'm so excited
to spend this day with Aven.

732
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,381
He is definitely someone
I was really interested

733
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,616
right off the bat.

734
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,017
Okay, let's go.
- Amazing.

735
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,486
- You look so good.

736
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:11,289
He is so attractive
and just an amazing person.

737
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,625
He really is
just the complete package,

738
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:16,761
and I do feel so lucky
that he's with me here today.

739
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,964
This is our ride today.
- Wow.

740
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,232
- You want to go see?

741
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:23,702
- Yeah, I'm in.
- Let's go and check it out.

742
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,104
- Rachel looks beautiful,
as always.

743
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,207
She's extremely attractive.
It's overwhelming sometimes.

744
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:30,375
And I'm excited.

745
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,477
This is so cool.

746
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:33,545
Look at all this.

747
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,580
There's a hot tub!

748
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:37,616
You're kidding!
- I know.

749
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,318
- So I'm really looking
forward to today.

750
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,370
I can't believe
how clear this water is.

751
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,638
- You want me to put
sunscreen on you?

752
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:52,330
- Yeah.
You want me to put some on you?

753
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,900
- Yeah. Can you get my back?
- Yeah.

754
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:57,702
The more and more I've gotten
to spend time with Rachel,

755
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,205
I continue to see her
as somebody that I can spend

756
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,406
the rest of my life with.

757
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,708
And last week at my Hometown,

758
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,253
I told her I was falling
in love with her.

759
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:08,079
So, hopefully, this week
is about going

760
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,681
where this is potentially
gonna end.

761
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:11,882
And the end is an engagement.

762
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,518
Cheers to building
on what we already have,

763
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,154
so cheers to you...
- Cheers.

764
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,989
- And to this week
and being in Mexico.

765
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:27,465
- Last week, when Aven told me
he's falling in love with me,

766
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,266
I felt so happy.

767
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,735
But I didn't say it back.

768
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,304
I was still in a headspace

769
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,907
where I didn't want
to say anything

770
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,876
to anyone until the very end

771
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:41,045
just because the love word
is a really big word

772
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:45,250
that was used by Clayton
really just carelessly

773
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:47,185
when I was on the other side.

774
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:52,190
But this week, I'm in charge
of how I want to move forward.

775
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:57,629
And after today, I really hope
to be ready to take that step.

776
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:58,930
- Mm.

777
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:00,432
How are we gonna
get tired of that?

778
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,211
The last time Rachel was
in this situation,

779
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,570
it wasn't easy for her.

780
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:08,640
I know this is kind of when
everything hit the fan.

781
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,141
I just want to do
everything I can

782
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,977
on my part to make her
feel special

783
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,745
and make her feel comfortable.

784
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,847
But it definitely is
a little bit scary

785
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,749
feeling this strongly
towards someone,

786
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:20,785
especially with other people
still being involved.

787
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,426
- Tino.
- Jesse, what's up?

788
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:29,704
- How's it going, man?
How you doing?

789
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:31,162
- What a pleasant surprise.

790
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,707
- Dude, it's been a minute
since I saw you back stateside,

791
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:33,908
so I just wanted
to check in with you.

792
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,142
- Yeah, come on in.
- You got a minute?

793
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,935
Awesome, man. Appreciate it.
- Absolutely.

794
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,615
- I just wanted
to catch up with you.

795
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,882
Like, tell me
where your head's at.

796
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,341
How's everything going?

797
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:47,278
- The waiting game is just,
like, gut-wrenching at times.

798
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,647
- Yeah.
- Every day here

799
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,949
when I'm not getting
the date card

800
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:52,851
or the invitation or whatever is

801
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,786
nails on a chalkboard to me.

802
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:58,356
It is trying my patience
beyond anything

803
00:35:58,423 --> 00:35:59,924
I could've, like, ever imagined,

804
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,294
and it's not gonna make sense
to anybody who, you know,

805
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,130
like, I explain this to
later on.

806
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,065
Like, how much
I struggled this week.

807
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:08,566
Except for you, probably.

808
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,402
- Yeah. I get it.

809
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:13,238
- But Rachel leaves me
with no doubt it's worth it.

810
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,407
So I'm gonna see this through,

811
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:19,411
and this week's gonna be awful,
but it's gonna end amazingly.

812
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:20,945
- Yeah, no, for sure.
I hear that.

813
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,252
Catch me up first. though.
Take me back to your Hometown.

814
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,949
How'd it go
on Hometowns with Rachel?

815
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,219
- Well, so my dad decided
to really take an interest

816
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:32,190
and make sure he asked
some tough questions, and...

817
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,494
Yeah, Rachel walked out of it
thinking he didn't like her.

818
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:37,762
- Really?

819
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,065
- And, I mean, I think
that was hard on her.

820
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,101
So it's horrible to think about.

821
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:48,840
- I had such a good time
in your hometown.

822
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:52,010
- It went as best
as it could've gone

823
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:54,813
and better than I thought
it would, honestly.

824
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,982
Yeah, I know I talked
to both my parents, obviously,

825
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,719
and they both were like,
"She's so amazing."

826
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,687
And I could tell
that they could see me

827
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,055
and, like, how happy I was

828
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:05,790
and the energy I had around you.

829
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:07,501
And that's the first thing
they both said to me

830
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,602
when I sat down with them
was, like,

831
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,328
"Wow, you look very happy
right now."

832
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,730
And I'm like, "Yeah, I am."

833
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,432
- My hopes going into it was,
like, I just want them

834
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,801
to, like, accept me at least,

835
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,670
and I feel like they did
more than that.

836
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,405
Like, I felt so welcome.

837
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:25,877
That going so well has, like,
made this so much easier too

838
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:29,547
because I know that they would
accept me, and it's just...

839
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,125
And it's a good feeling.
- Absolutely. You're accepted.

840
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:32,469
- And I think
it went really well.

841
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:35,353
- Dad and Mom love you.
- I know.

842
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,124
- Naturally, Dad is, like,
a little bit skeptical,

843
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,360
but I think she was, you know,
a little caught off guard,

844
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:45,430
so is it my favorite
of situations

845
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,007
where I'm splitting time
with other guys?

846
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:47,966
No.

847
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,934
Like, no
by a million times over.

848
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,137
And if I wasn't so sure

849
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:55,640
that, like, she's future
Mrs., like, Forever for me,

850
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:58,143
like, this would be

851
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,111
a probably easy week
to walk away from.

852
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:01,212
- Yeah.

853
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,947
- I think, like, you
meeting my family

854
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,315
and the reaction

855
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,985
and, like, just the whole day
and night together,

856
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,754
I'm just, like, yeah,
falling in love with you.

857
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:12,557
So that's why I had to say it.

858
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,859
And I meant it.

859
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,101
- I know it's fast
even for this journey,

860
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:26,871
but I knew for, in hindsight,
probably, like, weeks

861
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:28,273
that I felt this strongly
for her.

862
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,650
- That you were falling
in love with her?

863
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:32,076
- Yeah.
I mean, probably since Bruges.

864
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,279
- Wow.

865
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,948
- It's really, really hard
to think about her

866
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:38,516
being on an Overnight.

867
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,720
You know, it's hard
to be patient and wait,

868
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,122
especially when you know,

869
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:46,257
like, what's going on
while you're waiting.

870
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,960
It's gutting
to even think about.

871
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,147
- Hope it goes great.
- Yeah.

872
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,438
- I'm around
if you need anything, man.

873
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:52,540
Thanks for the chat.
- See you later, Jesse.

874
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:53,965
- See you, man.

875
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,667
- It's mind-boggling to me

876
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,536
if, like, she's not sure
at this point.

877
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,672
I certainly don't need
to sleep with anybody else.

878
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:08,847
- And I'm certainly worried
that my family

879
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:13,084
being so skeptical could
weigh in on her decision.

880
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,607
- Tonight is my first Overnight,

881
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,775
and it's a really big deal,

882
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,612
and I definitely feel
like I want

883
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,580
to spend tonight
with Aven and have

884
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:44,482
that intimate time together.

885
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,784
I feel like
it's really important

886
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:50,455
to explore your
physical connection as well.

887
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,892
And I do feel like
me and Aven are at that point

888
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,727
in our relationship
where that is

889
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,629
the last kind of missing piece.

890
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,264
Hi.

891
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,065
- My gosh, look at you.

892
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,368
So good to see you again.

893
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,271
- How are you?

894
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:10,041
- I do think
that Aven could be the one.

895
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:11,809
- This is beautiful.
- I know.

896
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,745
Wait till you see
where we're eating.

897
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:17,548
It wasn't until his Hometown
that I knew for sure

898
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,550
that I'm falling in love
with him.

899
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,753
And I've been
wanting to tell him.

900
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:25,356
But I'm so terrified
because of how it went

901
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,958
last time with Clayton.

902
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:30,528
I was so blindsided by him.

903
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:33,865
I was so excited for today.

904
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,333
I had the best day with you,

905
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,436
and cheers to a better night.

906
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:39,871
- Cheers.

907
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:46,144
- I always am excited
for our dates,

908
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:50,481
and each time I feel like
we're able to grow so much more

909
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,450
even if it's just,
like, little things.

910
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:53,885
- Mm-hmm.

911
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:57,455
- Like, I mean, even just kinda
going back to last week.

912
00:40:57,522 --> 00:41:00,291
Obviously,
it means so much to me

913
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:03,695
to be able to see myself
with your family

914
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,330
and to see where you came from.

915
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:09,567
And even just beyond that,
we have come so far.

916
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,836
- Long way.
- Such a long way.

917
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,004
- I definitely agree.

918
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:14,839
Like, I feel like
from the beginning,

919
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,307
from when I met you,

920
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,676
we just take the next step
every time, and like you said,

921
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:20,154
it just keeps getting
better and better

922
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:21,479
and we continue
to grow and grow.

923
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,481
And it's been
an amazing journey so far,

924
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:25,216
and I really hope it continues.

925
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:28,553
And yeah, last week
was so special to me.

926
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,121
It just meant a lot
that, you know,

927
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:31,365
you can potentially see yourself

928
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:32,557
a part of my family, so...

929
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,693
- And you would never be
in this position

930
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,929
if I didn't genuinely see

931
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,864
a life outside of this with you.

932
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:42,133
And that's exactly what I told
your parents as well.

933
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,101
- Mm-hmm.

934
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,504
- And I want us to be able

935
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:48,973
to be in a place
where we are on the page,

936
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,975
so I guess going into tonight,

937
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:54,645
I really do have a question.

938
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:57,115
Obviously, we're coming up
to a really big week.

939
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,951
- Absolutely.
- And moving forward,

940
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:04,288
can you genuinely see yourself
getting engaged in two weeks?

941
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:08,359
- I definitely can.

942
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:11,596
I think that, you know,
the moments that we've had,

943
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,531
we've continued
to build, build, and build.

944
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:15,767
And I think last week, you know,

945
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:19,370
that was really just kind of
the deciding factor for me

946
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:23,474
of knowing how ready I am
for this with you

947
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,909
and how I feel about you

948
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:27,045
and that I'm falling in love
with you.

949
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,547
And yeah, I can definitely see
a life with you

950
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:31,482
outside of all of this
and an engagement.

951
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,850
I feel like I'm ready for it.

952
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:35,453
Like, I came here in a really
good, like, mental space

953
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,454
and prepared for that.

954
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:38,189
And I didn't know if I was gonna

955
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:40,267
meet somebody that I felt
like I could do that with,

956
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,359
but I have.
- Mm-hmm.

957
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:44,295
- I'm 100% ready
and feel ready for it.

958
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:47,198
And you've made that
very easy for me.

959
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:49,100
But I definitely want it
to be something

960
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,002
that you feel as well.

961
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,204
I want you to feel the same.

962
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:54,505
- Yeah.

963
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,342
I feel like
everything I ask for,

964
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,811
you really embody.

965
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:02,647
I mean, we started out
a little bit slower,

966
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:06,818
but we were able to build
such a strong foundation,

967
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,020
and I feel like
from the beginning,

968
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,922
you were always
the person I was like,

969
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,490
"I feel so safe with him."

970
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:14,225
And that's huge for me
in a relationship.

971
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:15,493
- Mm-hmm.

972
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,862
- To feel that I can
be vulnerable with you,

973
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,864
and now I feel like
we are in the place

974
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,033
where we not only have

975
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,002
that friendship
and that foundation,

976
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:28,072
but just this incredible
romantic connection.

977
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:31,209
And you're so open
and you're so humble

978
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:35,446
and I think when I heard you say

979
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:39,650
that you were falling in love
when we were in Salem,

980
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:42,019
I was nervous to say
anything back to you

981
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:46,924
just because on my last journey,

982
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:49,026
I feel like that word was

983
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,562
really carelessly thrown around.

984
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,030
- Absolutely.

985
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:56,734
- And what that word
means to me is huge.

986
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,836
And of course I know
it means the same to you.

987
00:43:58,903 --> 00:43:59,837
- Yeah.

988
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:01,339
- And you would never use
that word

989
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,074
if you weren't
absolutely feeling it,

990
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,676
which is why
I'm comfortable saying

991
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:08,613
that I am falling in love
with you.

992
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,215
Oh, my gosh.

993
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:13,151
- Ah!
- And I truly mean it.

994
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:21,292
- I'm on cloud nine.

995
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,060
It meant
the absolute world to me

996
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,129
that she was able to say
that she was falling

997
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:26,697
in love with me as well.

998
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:27,999
I didn't really have words.

999
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,001
I was just so happy to hear

1000
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,936
that the feeling was mutual.

1001
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,538
- I have something.

1002
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,339
- Wow, a card?

1003
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:36,807
I can open this and read it?

1004
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,943
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, wow.

1005
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,046
- I feel so happy.

1006
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:47,518
Aven truly has everything
I've asked for and more.

1007
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:50,755
- "Please use this key
to stay together as a couple

1008
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,456
in the Fantasy Suite."

1009
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,358
Wow. I'm excited.

1010
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,260
Let's do it.
- Is it a yes?

1011
00:44:56,327 --> 00:44:59,797
- That's a absolute yes for me.

1012
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:04,135
- I really believe every
single thing Aven says to me.

1013
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:07,338
And he continues
to prove with his actions

1014
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:10,374
over and over again
that he wants to be with me.

1015
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,810
Oh, my God!

1016
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:18,816
I'm so happy right now.

1017
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:21,185
Wow.

1018
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:25,189
- I feel like this journey
is working for me.

1019
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:28,426
It truly does feel like
he's too good to be true.

1020
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,462
Ooh.

1021
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:34,065
- Oh, my God.
- My God.

1022
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:35,600
- This is so beautiful.

1023
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,868
- So beautiful.

1024
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:41,439
- I feel so excited
because I've been waiting

1025
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:45,443
for this moment,
and it is the perfect end

1026
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,712
to such a fairy tale day.

1027
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,414
Like, I just really am
on cloud nine.

1028
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:55,486
Whenever I'm with Aven, I just
fall for him more and more.

1029
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:58,389
And I can definitely see
myself spending

1030
00:45:58,456 --> 00:46:00,191
the rest of my life with him.

1031
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:15,740
- That was a good night.

1032
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,241
- It was a great night.

1033
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:20,144
I'm on cloud nine.

1034
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:22,179
After last night, for sure.

1035
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:27,885
- After spending the night
with Aven,

1036
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,720
I just really am on

1037
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,989
kind of a different level
with him right now.

1038
00:46:32,056 --> 00:46:33,658
It's gonna be hard to top.

1039
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,826
I'm just running
on a high right now.

1040
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,461
You're very chipper today.

1041
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:39,297
- Yeah? Am I chipper?

1042
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,132
Yes.

1043
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:43,501
It's definitely really important

1044
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,804
to explore
your physical connection,

1045
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:50,441
and Aven is the full package.

1046
00:46:50,508 --> 00:46:52,777
The full package.

1047
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:56,147
- Cheers to an amazing night
and an amazing morning.

1048
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:57,615
- Cheers.

1049
00:46:57,682 --> 00:46:59,617
Oh, do we do this?
- Are we doing this?

1050
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:03,187
Kind of slept
for, like, 20 minutes,

1051
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:05,523
and the sun was just beaming in.

1052
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,892
And I was like, "Dang,
this is really nice."

1053
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,428
Just waking up next to her.

1054
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,431
It felt like... it felt right.

1055
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,333
It felt natural and right.

1056
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:18,069
- I really am so excited

1057
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,338
that we got to spend
the night together

1058
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:24,175
and take our relationship
to a new level.

1059
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:26,711
- I appreciate it.

1060
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:29,313
- Aven, I am falling
in love with you.

1061
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,449
- I'm falling in love
with you deeper.

1062
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:37,388
I'm very confident
about where we're at.

1063
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:41,125
And I would love
to be engaged to her

1064
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:44,095
and start a relationship
and start a life with her.

1065
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:45,763
The fact that I've
now met somebody

1066
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:49,233
that I feel like I can get
there with is a big deal.

1067
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,468
Yesterday was amazing.

1068
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,902
Thank you.

1069
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:54,004
- Don't forget about me.
- Oh, yeah.

1070
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,749
- Don't forget
I'm falling in love with you.

1071
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:56,707
Don't forget that either.

1072
00:47:56,774 --> 00:47:57,875
- I'm in love with you too.

1073
00:47:57,942 --> 00:48:00,277
I will not forget.

1074
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,580
- I'm gonna miss you.

1075
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:03,748
- Bye.
- Bye.

1076
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:21,499
- Oh, my gosh, this has been
excruciating waiting.

1077
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,667
I've been dying to see Rachel.

1078
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,737
I was ready to pull out my hair.

1079
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:29,206
You establish
an amazing connection

1080
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,142
and tell each other
that you're falling in love

1081
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,710
with each other
and then have to wait

1082
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:35,613
while other guys are trying
to entertain her.

1083
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:38,182
But that's all fading away
by the minute

1084
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,918
because I'm so excited
for the date today.

1085
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:46,624
I really, really want today
to go well.

1086
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,560
Rachel's seen
how badly this week can go,

1087
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:51,829
from her previous experience,
and I just, like,

1088
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:53,431
need to keep making it known

1089
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:54,965
that I am the for-sure thing.

1090
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,634
I don't care
about the other guys.

1091
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,936
And, you know, the light
at the end of the tunnel's

1092
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:01,305
worth stomaching
all these challenges.

1093
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:17,888
- Today, I'm seeing Tino.

1094
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,492
Coming off the most incredible
day with Aven.

1095
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:24,562
It's hard to switch
from Aven to Tino.

1096
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,398
I'm excited, but I am
so nervous about today

1097
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,099
just because last week,

1098
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,669
Hometowns didn't go well
with his family.

1099
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,438
So I think tonight we do
need to discuss the fact

1100
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:36,140
that his family is
really not supportive

1101
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,108
and, like, how we're
gonna move past it.

1102
00:49:39,844 --> 00:49:41,445
- Wow.
- Hi.

1103
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:43,013
Good to see you.

1104
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,315
- Great to see you.

1105
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:47,751
How are you?

1106
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,986
It's a big day.

1107
00:49:49,053 --> 00:49:52,623
And I know that this day has
so much potential

1108
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,959
to bring us to a whole new
level of feeling.

1109
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,695
And I really hope
that we can get there.

1110
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,630
I think we can.

1111
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:01,599
How are you doing?

1112
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,133
- Better now.
- Better?

1113
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,969
Are you ready to go?
- Yeah, I'm so ready.

1114
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:06,637
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's do it.

1115
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:08,272
- How are you?
- I'm good.

1116
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,841
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

1117
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:13,010
- I'm excited for you to see
what we're doing.

1118
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:15,579
- I'm excited too.

1119
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:18,282
Oh, horses. Sweet.

1120
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,783
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

1121
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,919
- Have you ever
ridden a horse before?

1122
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:23,587
- Not in a couple years.

1123
00:50:23,654 --> 00:50:25,332
- I saw that picture of you
with a cowboy hat on

1124
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:26,624
in your house.

1125
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,425
Perfect.

1126
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:29,927
Hello, horses.
- Aww.

1127
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:32,730
I've always wanted to do
something like this with Tino,

1128
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:36,700
and the horses in the jungle,
it's just so magical,

1129
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:37,868
so romantic.

1130
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:40,304
It's definitely
a bucket list date.

1131
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,940
Their little braids are so cute.

1132
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:46,377
I think Tino is gonna do
great today on the horse.

1133
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:48,078
Okay.

1134
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,247
- Sorry, buddy,
I've seen thinner days.

1135
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:54,018
- He's very athletic
and he had the cowboy hat on

1136
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:55,519
in one of his baby pictures,

1137
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,655
so maybe he's, like,
real country.

1138
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,256
- Oh, this way, this way.

1139
00:50:59,323 --> 00:51:01,158
Oh.

1140
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,993
- Wait, wait. Hey.

1141
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,030
Oh, sorry. Whoa.

1142
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,197
- We're not going this way.

1143
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:09,233
Come on, turn around.

1144
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,001
I haven't ridden a horse
in a couple years.

1145
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,103
Mine's a little rambunctious.

1146
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,171
You're good, you're good.

1147
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,172
I'm here.

1148
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,074
But we're having a great time.

1149
00:51:17,141 --> 00:51:18,776
- Oh, my goodness.

1150
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,978
This is a ride.

1151
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,315
- So excited to be here.

1152
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:27,384
I'm falling really fast,
and when I'm not with her,

1153
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,687
I wish I was with her,
and when I'm with her,

1154
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,388
I don't want to be
anywhere else.

1155
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,292
- Ooh!

1156
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,494
- Oh, my God.
- You can do it, Rach.

1157
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,229
- See, you're just trying
to race.

1158
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:40,564
Attaboy.

1159
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:42,700
You know, I had nerves
coming into today

1160
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,103
just because last week,
Rachel met my family,

1161
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,806
which presented
some unique challenges,

1162
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,617
but when we see each other
for the first time,

1163
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:52,776
and, like, it starts
going away exponentially

1164
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,120
and then we're back
to the middle.

1165
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:57,014
- Oh, no, I can't run
when I'm in this top.

1166
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:59,416
- I mean, this journey's been
a lot of ups and downs,

1167
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:02,953
but we're certainly
riding an up right now.

1168
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,855
- They're so in love.

1169
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:06,362
- What do you think?
Are you in love?

1170
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:16,367
- Wow.
- I know.

1171
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,102
- This is so cool.

1172
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:20,804
No way. This is all ours?
- Right? Yes!

1173
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,039
- Do we get to jump in?

1174
00:52:22,106 --> 00:52:24,108
- Do you want to?
- Yeah.

1175
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:26,186
- If I slip and fall in,
are you gonna go in after me?

1176
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,645
- 100%.

1177
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,980
Are you good?

1178
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:32,850
- I had my foot caught.

1179
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,752
- This is so beautiful.

1180
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,086
- Yeah, this is amazing.

1181
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,722
- I haven't seen you in a while.

1182
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:41,025
- Not since our Hometown.

1183
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,794
- I know.
How have you been feeling?

1184
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:46,163
- Really good.

1185
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,832
I mean, like, how it ended
kind of, like, sent me

1186
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,567
to cloud nine,
and that was amazing.

1187
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:51,769
- Yeah.

1188
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,338
Hearing you say you were
falling in love with me,

1189
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:57,975
just hearing that at the end
of the night was just amazing,

1190
00:52:58,042 --> 00:53:00,577
and I'm glad I got to tell you
because I have

1191
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:02,479
been feeling it for a while.

1192
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:05,649
So I was just kind of hoping
that you would say something.

1193
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:08,786
- I for sure had been
feeling it for a while.

1194
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,121
I wanted to make sure
the moment was just, like...

1195
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,589
It did it justice.

1196
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:16,326
And it just could not have felt
more right when I did.

1197
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,962
- Yeah.
- And I think all in all, like,

1198
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,531
it turned out so amazing,

1199
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:24,368
but yeah, I mean,
here and there, I kinda...

1200
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:26,837
It makes me kind of,
like, scratch my head

1201
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:29,339
'cause the night portion went,
like, a little different

1202
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:30,406
than I expected.

1203
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:31,475
- Mm-hmm.

1204
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,862
- But anything
on your mind since?

1205
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:36,046
- I just feel like I have had
a lot of nerves,

1206
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:40,417
especially because I feel
so strongly about you.

1207
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:44,188
And there is a little bit
just of general anxiety

1208
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:45,856
coming off of Hometowns,

1209
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:48,759
and what I've been through,
like...

1210
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:50,170
- No, I know.
This week is loaded, yeah.

1211
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:52,696
- Just in general,
this week is huge

1212
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:54,131
just in so many ways.

1213
00:53:54,198 --> 00:53:56,033
You know, I'm so excited,

1214
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,777
but in the back of my mind,
I am just, like, scared,

1215
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:59,012
like, "Oh, my God,
like, what if,

1216
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:00,447
like, it goes off the wall?"
- Don't do that.

1217
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:01,405
Trust me.
- I know.

1218
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:02,773
- I'm trying so hard not to.

1219
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,576
Like, I'm trying
not to, like, "what if" myself

1220
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,711
into, like, a bad place, like...
- Yeah. I know.

1221
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:08,922
- This is the only thing
I care about.

1222
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:10,247
- Me too.

1223
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:13,751
- So it'll be fine.

1224
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,593
- Rachel looks nervous.

1225
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:23,861
I don't know why.

1226
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,529
I mean, it could be
about my Hometown,

1227
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,498
it could be about,
like, my parents

1228
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,733
asking her some pretty
penetrating questions.

1229
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,302
I hope it's not about that.

1230
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,471
You know, I hope we can just
tackle it later tonight.

1231
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:36,607
And I'll try
to kind of peel it back

1232
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:38,017
and make sure
she feels as comfortable

1233
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:39,276
as she always does around me.

1234
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:40,787
- Okay, you count down,
then we go on three.

1235
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:43,247
- One, two, three.

1236
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:50,654
- Can we go again?
- Yeah.

1237
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:53,123
- Okay, let's do it.

1238
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,858
- I feel like I have
a lot of anxiety,

1239
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:57,694
and I think he can tell
I'm nervous.

1240
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,563
I really hope that tonight

1241
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,866
we're able to have
really serious conversations

1242
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:06,370
about last week and what
happened with his parents

1243
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,806
and how we're
gonna move past it.

1244
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:11,308
If we don't find a way
to solve the problem,

1245
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:13,944
I just don't think
I can move forward.

1246
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,997
- This is so beautiful.

1247
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,866
I am so in my head.

1248
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:38,368
As fun as today was,
I think tonight I have to have

1249
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:41,271
some really serious
conversations.

1250
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,140
With Tino,
I do have actual issues.

1251
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:44,775
Like, I'm scared to move forward

1252
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,711
because of what happened
at Hometowns with his family.

1253
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:48,812
Wow.

1254
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:50,881
- That's amazing.

1255
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:54,418
- It scares me
because my one thing I wanted

1256
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:56,920
out of Hometowns Week
was just acceptance.

1257
00:55:56,987 --> 00:55:58,488
And I didn't get it.

1258
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:00,457
- This is yet again

1259
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,326
one of the coolest things
I've ever done.

1260
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:04,027
- Look at that.

1261
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,063
How much in the back
of his mind is he like,

1262
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:07,865
"My family doesn't like her"?

1263
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,800
It's hard to think
that it would have no effect

1264
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,202
on how he's thinking.

1265
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:13,871
Thank you.

1266
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:16,874
Can he honestly move forward
with an engagement

1267
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,175
without support?

1268
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:20,911
Like, there is kind of
that urgency for me

1269
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:23,814
to really get to the bottom
of this.

1270
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:26,116
How are you feeling?
- Amazing.

1271
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:28,852
- Good.
- Today has been so amazing.

1272
00:56:28,919 --> 00:56:30,187
It's always so fun with you.

1273
00:56:30,254 --> 00:56:33,323
So I'm just glad we get
even more time together.

1274
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:37,261
You know, I mean,
this week's been challenging.

1275
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:39,229
I mean, I feel like
a broken record saying that

1276
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:42,165
because every second
I have to wait to get

1277
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,534
more time with you is like
nails on a chalkboard to me,

1278
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:48,171
but, like always,
the second we're together,

1279
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,140
all that fades away
and I'm just so excited

1280
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:52,809
and I love every second
with you, so cheers to that.

1281
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,378
- Cheers.

1282
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,882
Is there anything on your mind?
- Yeah.

1283
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:01,718
So you said that you were,
like, a little bit nervous

1284
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:06,556
coming into today, and, like,
I just want, like, you to feel

1285
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:08,025
so, like, comfortable

1286
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,394
just telling me
whatever is on your mind,

1287
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,704
if you're feeling a little nervy

1288
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,597
or, you know, uncomfortable.

1289
00:57:13,664 --> 00:57:15,875
- Yeah, no, I don't think it's,
like, being uncomfortable.

1290
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:18,735
You never make me
feel uncomfortable,

1291
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:21,004
but I think just in general,

1292
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:23,707
I just have felt
a lot of anxiety

1293
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,342
with just this week,

1294
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:29,513
and last time,
it just was such a rough week.

1295
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,381
I'm trying to go into everything

1296
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,050
with a really positive attitude,

1297
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,651
but I guess with that,

1298
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:37,354
I also have been kind of

1299
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:39,656
wanting to talk about Hometowns.

1300
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:41,491
- Okay.
- And kind of what

1301
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:44,761
I spoke to your parents about
a little bit.

1302
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:46,463
- Mm-hmm.

1303
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:51,702
- I just feel like they really
just did not like me.

1304
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:55,973
And it was just
a really big struggle for me,

1305
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,508
I think specifically
with your dad.

1306
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,944
And I got scared.

1307
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:03,513
"Oh, my gosh, Tino's not
gonna want to move forward.

1308
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,958
"Like, how are we
gonna get past this?

1309
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,617
"How is this gonna end
in an engagement

1310
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:09,987
when I know how much
your family means to you?"

1311
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:12,055
We've talked so much at length.

1312
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:13,666
You know, 'cause I'm like
"Well, how is he

1313
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,392
"gonna move forward
when they they're just

1314
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:18,729
they don't like me,"
and I can't convince anyone.

1315
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:20,897
I think the last thing
your dad said to me,

1316
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:22,632
like, one of the last things,
he was like,

1317
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:26,269
"Well, like, I'm not gonna
disown him if he gets engaged.

1318
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,305
Like, I just can't accept it."

1319
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:29,852
And I was just like, "Whoa!"
- Really?

1320
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:31,641
- Yeah.
- Wow, okay.

1321
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:32,919
I didn't know that.
- Or, like, along those lines.

1322
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:34,845
I was like,
"I desperately want this"...

1323
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:37,481
Like, not even just approval,
but, like, "Okay,

1324
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,750
we don't get it,
but, like, okay."

1325
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:41,852
And I feel like
I didn't even get that,

1326
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,987
and I was like, "Well,
I'm worried about you."

1327
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:47,057
Like, can you get
to a point at the end

1328
00:58:47,124 --> 00:58:49,860
where, like, even if you don't
have their approval,

1329
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:51,361
you're still like...

1330
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:54,431
Can you honestly, like,
move forward with this?

1331
00:58:57,034 --> 00:59:00,237
- I don't feel like
my dad gets me as much

1332
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,839
in the relationship sphere.

1333
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:05,575
He's not... it's not, like, you.

1334
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:08,078
They're really just skeptical
of the situation.

1335
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:09,679
And I think that's...
- Understandable.

1336
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:13,050
- Probably what your parents,
like, did the last time around.

1337
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:16,753
Like, they just can't fathom
the situation we're in

1338
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,890
where, like, we do get to know
each other and make each other

1339
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:23,760
feel a certain way
so quickly, so strongly.

1340
00:59:23,827 --> 00:59:28,131
But they know me and they know
I wouldn't be here

1341
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:31,535
if I didn't see you
as the future.

1342
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:34,938
- I don't want you to say this
because you're like, "Oh, well,

1343
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:37,007
"I really, like,
want this to work,

1344
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:38,208
so I'm just gonna say that."

1345
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:39,943
Like, do you genuinely believe,
like...

1346
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,711
- Yes.
- If, let's say, we got engaged

1347
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,756
and we call them up
and you're like, "I'm engaged,"

1348
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,383
that they're gonna be like,
"Yes"?

1349
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:48,452
Like, they're not gonna
be mad at you or me?

1350
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:50,420
- They're not gonna be mad
at you or me.

1351
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:52,389
100%.

1352
00:59:52,456 --> 00:59:53,790
- You think?
- Yes. No.

1353
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:55,125
- You're, like, confident.

1354
00:59:55,192 --> 00:59:57,327
- I know
they're gonna come around.

1355
00:59:57,394 --> 00:59:59,162
End of story.
- Okay.

1356
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:01,298
- It's probably not
gonna be overnight,

1357
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:04,968
and I don't expect your parents
to, like, love me overnight...

1358
01:00:05,035 --> 01:00:08,672
- Mm-hmm.
- But I see you as the future.

1359
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,440
There's just no reality here

1360
01:00:10,507 --> 01:00:12,008
where, like, they don't
get on board.

1361
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:13,977
I see it so clearly with you

1362
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:15,946
and I can't go home
without you at this point.

1363
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:20,383
So they're gonna have
to get on board with that.

1364
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,461
And they're gonna love you.

1365
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:23,420
'Cause eventually
they're gonna see

1366
01:00:23,487 --> 01:00:24,855
the woman that I see,

1367
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:27,491
and it'll be impossible not to.

1368
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:30,293
You're so incredibly beautiful
and you match that

1369
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,196
with being ambitious,
being smart, wanting a family,

1370
01:00:33,263 --> 01:00:36,333
wanting, you know, a career
and, like, all these things

1371
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,201
that, like, I imagined
in, like, somebody

1372
01:00:38,268 --> 01:00:41,071
and it took forever and going
in front of the world stage

1373
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:42,439
to find.

1374
01:00:42,506 --> 01:00:46,042
And my heart's a little bit
in my throat saying this,

1375
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:49,346
but... I love you, Rachel.

1376
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:52,949
I'm in love with you.

1377
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:55,652
I love everything,
like, I find out about you,

1378
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:58,388
and I feel like it's overdue,

1379
01:00:58,455 --> 01:01:00,757
but I'm so happy to say it.

1380
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:07,397
I love you too.

1381
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:09,232
I really do.

1382
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:18,708
Oh, my God, like, it's been me
waiting for this declaration

1383
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:21,878
for so long, and then
all of a sudden I hear it.

1384
01:01:21,945 --> 01:01:24,614
And it feels so amazing
to hear him say that.

1385
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,783
And to say it back,

1386
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,885
it's a huge moment in your life.

1387
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:31,621
Like, everyone waits
for that moment.

1388
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,990
- Oh, I get a date card.

1389
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:36,259
- Tino did tell me
that if he loves me,

1390
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:38,728
his family will come around,
and I think that answer

1391
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:40,330
is good enough for me.

1392
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:44,801
I would absolutely love to go,
if you want to.

1393
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:47,470
- I would absolutely love to go.

1394
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,940
- All I could do is
bring up my concerns

1395
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:53,009
and moving forward,
hopefully with how he feels,

1396
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:55,679
his family will
also come around.

1397
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:56,880
They'd better.

1398
01:01:56,947 --> 01:01:59,449
Because I really do see Tino
at the end.

1399
01:02:03,153 --> 01:02:07,557
- I feel so amazing.

1400
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:09,359
Oh, my God, this is huge.

1401
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:14,331
What do you think?

1402
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,167
- I love Rachel!
This is the best night ever.

1403
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:23,740
- To hear that Rachel's in love
with me, it's indescribable.

1404
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:26,109
I'm all about this girl.
I'm in love with her.

1405
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:28,144
There's nothing else
to think about.

1406
01:02:32,716 --> 01:02:37,654
We're following the feeling,
and everything we do

1407
01:02:37,721 --> 01:02:40,790
reassures that we're right.

1408
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:43,260
I really love Rachel.

1409
01:02:56,806 --> 01:03:00,877
- My last Overnight with Erich
was so special

1410
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:03,847
and I really can
see us together,

1411
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:07,684
but today is my Overnight date
with Johnny,

1412
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:09,019
and I'm so excited.

1413
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:10,720
I know we're gonna have
a ton of fun.

1414
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,858
Whoa!

1415
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:17,627
He really gets me
in a way that I never,

1416
01:03:17,694 --> 01:03:19,796
ever had a man get me before.

1417
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:21,031
- So what are we gonna do?

1418
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:22,132
- We're going on a boat.

1419
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:23,867
- A sailboat?
- Yeah.

1420
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:27,037
Yes.

1421
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:29,539
I'm hoping today
just brings us together

1422
01:03:29,606 --> 01:03:31,308
and that we can see ourselves

1423
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,710
one step closer
to an engagement.

1424
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:42,218
Have you been on one of these?
- No, I actually have not.

1425
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:45,322
- Really?
- I used to have a Hobie Cat.

1426
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:46,599
I don't know if that's,
like, the same thing.

1427
01:03:46,623 --> 01:03:48,425
- Oh, me too.
It's like a hamster.

1428
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,727
What?

1429
01:03:50,794 --> 01:03:52,729
What are you talking about?
- A boat.

1430
01:03:52,796 --> 01:03:54,564
- An animal?
- No.

1431
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:55,932
Today's huge. I'm so excited.

1432
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:57,667
I cannot believe
that I'm here with Gabby.

1433
01:03:57,734 --> 01:03:59,069
I mean, every time we hang out,

1434
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:02,372
it kind or progresses
and builds a bigger foundation.

1435
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:04,341
- Just nice being here.
- No, it's cool.

1436
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:05,818
Just as long
as you're here, I'm good.

1437
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,410
I don't care what we do.
- Great.

1438
01:04:07,477 --> 01:04:09,245
- It's all good.

1439
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:12,315
She's opened me up and made me
feel confident about myself

1440
01:04:12,382 --> 01:04:14,417
in ways that I have
never felt confident.

1441
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:16,353
And then, you know,
we hit Hometowns

1442
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:17,620
and she met the family.

1443
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,856
I think that kind of just
catapulted us further.

1444
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:20,990
- Cheers.

1445
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:22,325
- Can we cheers?
- Yeah.

1446
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:23,827
To us in Mexico.

1447
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:25,729
- Mexico. Hell yeah.

1448
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:29,999
Gabby is the dopest girl
I think I've ever hung with.

1449
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:33,036
You have beauty, you have
brains, you have a good time,

1450
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:35,038
you have, like, my person.

1451
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:36,439
- It's, like, so crazy.

1452
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:39,209
I feel like we've seen so much
of the world together.

1453
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:40,844
- Yes, we actually have.

1454
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,846
Yeah, it's been wild.
- Yeah. I know.

1455
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:44,781
Like, starting in LA,
and then Europe,

1456
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:46,649
and then your hometown,
and now Mexico.

1457
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,319
- Yeah.
- You're so easy to be with,

1458
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:50,720
and I feel like I can be

1459
01:04:50,787 --> 01:04:52,856
my most ridiculous self
with you.

1460
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:54,290
- 100%.
- Yeah?

1461
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:56,926
- You can be whatever you want.
- I know.

1462
01:04:56,993 --> 01:05:00,130
- It's been moments with you,
so it's just been,

1463
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:04,434
like, amazing moments that I'm,
like, trying to just take in.

1464
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:05,501
- Me too.

1465
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,612
- Like, this is a moment
right now.

1466
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,004
Everything's a moment, so...

1467
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,639
- It's so crazy, but it's like,

1468
01:05:09,706 --> 01:05:11,307
I can't believe that we're here.

1469
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:14,377
The mansion feels like
yesterday and years ago.

1470
01:05:14,444 --> 01:05:15,512
- And years ago.

1471
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,980
It went by so quick,
but then again,

1472
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:20,383
I feel like it's never ending,
like it's, like, forever.

1473
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:22,852
Like I'm stuck here.

1474
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,854
- Yay, roses!

1475
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,256
Whoa!

1476
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:27,891
- I got another one.
- What happened?

1477
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:29,859
- No, but it does
feel like that.

1478
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,729
It feels like forever ago,
but yesterday too.

1479
01:05:32,796 --> 01:05:36,332
- I feel like every time
we're together,

1480
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:40,670
I think I see a new side
of you, which is nice.

1481
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:44,140
Even I feel like you're getting
more comfortable with me still.

1482
01:05:44,207 --> 01:05:45,418
I mean, like...
- I'm trying to.

1483
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,377
- How are you?
Like, what you feel really.

1484
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,012
- What? You don't think I...

1485
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:51,581
- No, I... no, I feel like
you're comfortable around me.

1486
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:53,683
- Oh, for sure.
- Yeah.

1487
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,719
- Yeah, but still I feel like...
Not a whole lot,

1488
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:59,923
but still, like, gotta get
somewhat more comfortable,

1489
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,791
I don't know.
- Yeah, no, absolutely.

1490
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:05,361
I think there's always gonna be
some of that, for sure.

1491
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:07,096
- I think
you've opened up, too, a lot,

1492
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:08,698
even just from the first time.
- Yeah.

1493
01:06:08,765 --> 01:06:10,266
- 100% yeah.

1494
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:15,972
- Whenever I'm with Johnny,
it is so easy and effortless.

1495
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:18,441
Being with him feels so natural.

1496
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:22,412
He's really taught me
to trust people.

1497
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:25,048
- Should we do this?

1498
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:28,518
- And has led me to the point
where I truly can see a life

1499
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:30,019
together outside of this.

1500
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:33,022
I'm so hopeful
about a future with him.

1501
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,792
There is something
about being from Colorado

1502
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:39,796
that whenever I feel
cold things on my feet,

1503
01:06:39,863 --> 01:06:41,464
I get thirsty.

1504
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:43,166
That's strange.

1505
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:45,635
- That sounds like
a you problem.

1506
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:46,970
Whoa, this is for us?

1507
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:49,038
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

1508
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:52,408
- But before I move
into an Overnight with him,

1509
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:55,712
I need to know that he can
see a future with me as well.

1510
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:59,082
I feel like you have been
so open with me right away.

1511
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:01,851
It's like you've taken it
upon yourself

1512
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:04,654
to take a chance, but...

1513
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:06,131
- Definitely don't open up
that quick,

1514
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:08,191
so I never talk
about how I feel.

1515
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:10,460
Like I do, but it takes a while,

1516
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,662
and, like, I think you helped
me evolve in a way.

1517
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:14,430
I've said it before,
but you make me

1518
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,466
want to be a better man.

1519
01:07:19,302 --> 01:07:21,771
- Well, I think you, like,
always had it in yourself

1520
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:24,073
and you were just ready,
you know?

1521
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:25,208
- Just needed that person.

1522
01:07:25,275 --> 01:07:26,509
- Yeah.

1523
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:27,911
I think, like, you were,

1524
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:29,417
seems like,
at the point in your life

1525
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:33,182
where you were ready to, like,
take a leap of faith too.

1526
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:34,617
- For sure.

1527
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:36,262
Yeah, I feel like I was
just kind of feeling stuck too

1528
01:07:36,286 --> 01:07:38,254
and just kind of needed
to go in a way,

1529
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:40,356
and this was, like,
huge in that process.

1530
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:43,893
And a lot of it is
to thank you for, so...

1531
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,829
- Like I said before,
I really didn't know

1532
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,299
what I was gonna get
coming into this.

1533
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:51,367
And, like, much like
you've grown here,

1534
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,536
I think so have I.

1535
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:59,142
And I have, like, grown
into really wanting

1536
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,944
something, you know.
- Yeah.

1537
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:04,180
- It is, like, time
to make a relationship,

1538
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:06,716
like, my full priority.

1539
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:12,422
I'm just, like, at a place
where it is what I want

1540
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:14,591
and, like, need almost.

1541
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,593
- I, like...

1542
01:08:16,658 --> 01:08:18,094
It's a hard thing
to think about.

1543
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:21,764
It's such a quick process,
and that's... like, I don't know.

1544
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,633
Like, I know
how I was feeling about you.

1545
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,035
I'm so into you.
- Yeah.

1546
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,871
- And I just...
The end result scares me.

1547
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,307
I also didn't know I'd be here
on the beach with you

1548
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:34,410
and falling in love
with you, so...

1549
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:38,147
- Hearing you say
how you feel about me,

1550
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:41,317
like, means the world
no matter what.

1551
01:08:41,384 --> 01:08:45,121
And, like, these weeks
have been so fast,

1552
01:08:45,188 --> 01:08:48,591
and, like, we're, like,
ending, you know,

1553
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:51,661
like, a week
or a little over a week.

1554
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:54,997
So I don't know.

1555
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:59,835
Kind of... like, what do you...
Like...

1556
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:01,771
I am at a place in my life

1557
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:06,541
where I do feel like, you know,
I'm, like, ready to be engaged.

1558
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,344
- I mean,
are you asking where I feel

1559
01:09:08,411 --> 01:09:11,113
about that whole thing
'cause we have a week left?

1560
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,548
- No pressure.
- No pressure.

1561
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:13,850
- Yeah.

1562
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:20,690
- That's a hard thing
to think about.

1563
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:22,725
It's like a battle in my head.

1564
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,470
I don't know, like,
what to think or what to do.

1565
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:26,529
And, like,
you deserve everything.

1566
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:29,398
And you should get
everything you want, so...

1567
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:31,533
- You too.
- Where do I stand in that?

1568
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:34,370
And that's, like,
such a hard thing to decide.

1569
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:37,773
- I'm just, like,
at a place, like,

1570
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,243
I am... like, I'm ready.

1571
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:44,580
- I told you, like,
I can see myself

1572
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:45,791
falling in love with you.
- Yeah.

1573
01:09:45,815 --> 01:09:47,649
- I can see me and you
being together,

1574
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:51,421
but it's more so just me
bringing 100% to the table

1575
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:54,357
and if I'm ready to bring 100%,
and if I'm not,

1576
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:56,059
do I drag you through that?

1577
01:09:58,695 --> 01:09:59,996
- Yeah.

1578
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:08,438
Just give me a second.

1579
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:13,675
It seems like
he's not able to commit.

1580
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:16,312
It's just really frustrating.

1581
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:22,085
Because I am so ready
at this point

1582
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:24,187
to leave here engaged

1583
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:26,856
with someone
who is committed to me.

1584
01:10:26,923 --> 01:10:31,794
But what if he feels like he
can't or shouldn't be with me?

1585
01:10:44,005 --> 01:10:46,943
- I am feeling really frustrated

1586
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:50,313
because there is a part of me,
a big part of me,

1587
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:54,916
that has asked to be loved
my whole life.

1588
01:10:55,017 --> 01:11:00,189
So having to ask Johnny about
his feelings really hurts.

1589
01:11:00,255 --> 01:11:03,259
I am terrified
that Johnny might tell me

1590
01:11:03,326 --> 01:11:04,727
that he can't get there.

1591
01:11:04,794 --> 01:11:07,764
But I don't want to step
into an Overnight

1592
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:11,701
knowing that there's still big
questions being unanswered.

1593
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:18,541
- It's all good?

1594
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,109
- No.

1595
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:22,712
You just have to, like,
be honest with yourself,

1596
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:25,248
and me, 'cause it's not fair
to either of us,

1597
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:29,252
you know, if we were at the end
and then having this talk.

1598
01:11:30,585 --> 01:11:34,290
- Life with you would be insane.

1599
01:11:34,357 --> 01:11:35,657
- Mm-hmm.

1600
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:37,994
- You're exactly
the person that I'd want

1601
01:11:38,059 --> 01:11:40,196
to, like, fall in love with
and just be my person

1602
01:11:40,263 --> 01:11:43,032
forever, but...

1603
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:48,871
But I just don't know
if I can get to an engagement

1604
01:11:48,938 --> 01:11:51,374
in the next week or so.

1605
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,442
You know, it's not
that I don't like you.

1606
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:54,987
It's not that I'm not
falling for you.

1607
01:11:55,011 --> 01:11:56,651
It's not that I can't
see myself with you.

1608
01:11:56,712 --> 01:12:00,316
It's just more so
just, like, it scares me.

1609
01:12:00,383 --> 01:12:03,286
And...

1610
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:05,788
I don't know if I can
bring 100% to the table

1611
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:09,157
and commit to that end result
if I'm not ready.

1612
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:12,871
That's just me being
honest with you.

1613
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:14,463
- No, I know, and, like...

1614
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:16,275
- As much as I don't want
to tell you that either,

1615
01:12:16,299 --> 01:12:17,843
'cause as much as I want
to just hang out here

1616
01:12:17,867 --> 01:12:20,036
with you forever, I just...
- Yeah.

1617
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:28,210
It's obviously
really hard to hear.

1618
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:31,314
There was, like,
a big part of me

1619
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,550
that hoped

1620
01:12:34,617 --> 01:12:38,020
it would be, you know, like, us
one way or another.

1621
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:41,523
But I feel like

1622
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:45,394
we're just... we want
two different things.

1623
01:12:51,634 --> 01:12:53,502
I think, like, if it was,

1624
01:12:53,568 --> 01:12:55,471
like, a different time
for both of us,

1625
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:58,941
then we could be so, so great.

1626
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:01,277
- You deserve the world.
You're an amazing person.

1627
01:13:01,344 --> 01:13:05,748
And you should get everything
you've ever wanted, so I...

1628
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:09,184
- That's the hardest part
about relationships.

1629
01:13:09,252 --> 01:13:10,729
Honestly, like,
you want them to work,

1630
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:14,457
you want them to work, but if,
like, timing isn't there,

1631
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:18,394
we're at two different places,
like, you want to fix it,

1632
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:22,531
but there's not anything to fix.

1633
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:26,269
- So is this our goodbye?

1634
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,437
- I think so.

1635
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:31,173
- That's devastating.
- I know.

1636
01:13:40,216 --> 01:13:41,250
- My feelings are numb.

1637
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:42,561
I don't know
how to feel right now.

1638
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:43,986
I feel... like, I'm upset.

1639
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,859
Gabby wants something
that I don't know

1640
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,494
if I can give her
at this very moment.

1641
01:13:51,559 --> 01:13:53,129
It's not that I don't want to.

1642
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:54,697
I would love to give that
to her,

1643
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:57,032
but it's just something
I don't know how I can do

1644
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,534
within the next week.

1645
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:00,102
Thank you for everything.

1646
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:03,806
- Mm.
Thank you for being honest.

1647
01:14:03,873 --> 01:14:05,608
- I'm just upset.

1648
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:07,510
I don't want to say goodbye.

1649
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:08,744
There goes my lady.

1650
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:10,913
- Stop.

1651
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,582
It feels like a little bit
of a punch in the gut

1652
01:14:13,648 --> 01:14:15,785
because it was a fear,

1653
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:17,954
you know,
that I've had all along.

1654
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,423
And now it's kind of
coming to fruition,

1655
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:22,558
which is, I start to fall
for someone,

1656
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:25,928
but they can't meet me where
I am or give me what I need.

1657
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:29,198
And it's scary as hell.

1658
01:14:31,734 --> 01:14:33,269
Saying goodbye
to Johnny was hard,

1659
01:14:33,335 --> 01:14:36,472
but it's, like,
kind of meant to be.

1660
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:38,007
Because as much as, like,

1661
01:14:38,074 --> 01:14:39,875
I don't want to say goodbye
to Johnny

1662
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:43,212
and, like, I know he'll always
have a piece of me,

1663
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:46,048
like, I know there's
something waiting for me

1664
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:48,517
that's really great
with Erich and Jason.

1665
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:54,490
I've been tired of fighting
for love for a long time,

1666
01:14:54,557 --> 01:14:56,925
and having it
right in front of my face

1667
01:14:56,993 --> 01:15:01,597
is, like, so enlightening,

1668
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:03,432
in, like, the best way.

1669
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,535
- This is obviously a big week.
- Yeah.

1670
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:09,038
- One thing I do know
that is real

1671
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:10,806
is the connection
between Gabby and I.

1672
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:12,273
- Yeah.

1673
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:18,114
- I feel like Erich and Jason
have been really able

1674
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,316
to validate me
in a way that I didn't know,

1675
01:15:20,383 --> 01:15:22,585
like, I could ask for.

1676
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:25,921
Like, it is just the feeling
of being loved

1677
01:15:25,987 --> 01:15:29,025
that trumps all.

1678
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:32,528
- So do you feel like you're
falling in love with Gabby?

1679
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:35,630
- Um, I mean, I would say,

1680
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:38,401
yeah, not quite there just yet,
I would say.

1681
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:42,237
But I have strong feelings
towards Gabby,

1682
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:45,841
and, yeah, hopefully it turns
into something real

1683
01:15:45,907 --> 01:15:47,175
after this.

1684
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:51,347
- I am ready for an engagement,

1685
01:15:51,414 --> 01:15:53,716
and it's not something
that I really planned for.

1686
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:59,355
But I've seen myself progress
with Jason and Erich.

1687
01:15:59,422 --> 01:16:01,957
I didn't know
that I would get here.

1688
01:16:02,023 --> 01:16:04,059
I didn't know
that I could feel this way

1689
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:06,862
in such a short amount of time,
but I'm hopeful

1690
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:09,098
that I can leave here
with someone

1691
01:16:09,165 --> 01:16:11,500
that I want to spend
the rest of my life with.

1692
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:12,844
- So you're at a point
right now where you don't

1693
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:14,379
feel like you're ready
to get engaged to Gabby?

1694
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:15,838
- Yeah.
- Do you think you could

1695
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,639
get there
before this is all over?

1696
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:20,175
- Right now, like, I'm just
kind of taking it day by day

1697
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:23,446
and I want to be
as honest and upfront as I can

1698
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:25,714
and I would never want
to hide anything from her.

1699
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:27,282
You know.
- Yeah.

1700
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:30,719
- I mean, truthfully, like,
it's hard... like, in two weeks,

1701
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:32,755
like, it's hard
for me to see that.

1702
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:34,590
Yeah, it's just, right now,
it's hard for me

1703
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:38,059
to, like, get
to the point of engagement.

1704
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:59,215
- Saying goodbye to Johnny
today was really difficult

1705
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:02,985
and truly heartbreaking.

1706
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:06,121
This is the hardest week,
definitely.

1707
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:09,258
Now I really am placing
all my hopes

1708
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:12,594
on what I'm feeling
from Erich and Jason.

1709
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:15,698
But my heart is telling me
that they're both ready

1710
01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:18,734
for the commitment
to be together forever

1711
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,437
and ready for an engagement.

1712
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,214
Oh.

1713
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:41,557
"I need to see you.

1714
01:17:41,624 --> 01:17:43,826
I'll be waiting on the bridge."

1715
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:49,165
I hear a knock at the door
and there's a card.

1716
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:51,700
I don't know
how to feel about this.

1717
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:55,204
I have no idea
who wrote this note or why.

1718
01:17:55,271 --> 01:17:59,275
And I truly don't know
what to expect.

1719
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:03,879
My mind's kind of spinning,
and I know I should go,

1720
01:18:03,946 --> 01:18:06,415
but I am a little scared.

1721
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,342
- Hi.

1722
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:38,746
I thought you were
gonna be my grandpa.

1723
01:18:40,014 --> 01:18:42,017
- Sorry to disappoint you.
- Oh, please.

1724
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:56,465
You know, it's good to see you.
It always is.

1725
01:18:56,532 --> 01:18:59,501
How are you?
- I'm good.

1726
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:00,845
I didn't have anything
to, like, tell you or anything,

1727
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:02,047
I just wanted
to see you tonight.

1728
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:05,074
I was like, "I need
to figure this out."

1729
01:19:09,712 --> 01:19:11,547
I do have one thing
I want to tell you.

1730
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:13,882
You know our last date?

1731
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:15,851
Like, the day part was amazing.

1732
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:17,719
The night part, like,
I couldn't imagine that

1733
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:19,455
going any better.

1734
01:19:21,023 --> 01:19:23,492
And I'm, like, now sitting here
picturing the girl

1735
01:19:23,559 --> 01:19:26,895
that, like, I'm in love with
doing that with somebody else.

1736
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,197
Like, that kind of crushes me.

1737
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:32,134
And this is not gonna be easy,

1738
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:36,237
but I just want to tell you
how I feel because...

1739
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:39,041
I think I'm having
a really hard time.

1740
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:40,509
Didn't plan
on telling you anything,

1741
01:19:40,576 --> 01:19:43,312
but I just want to tell you
where I'm coming from.

1742
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:47,182
I do want to say that.

1743
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:49,351
- Yeah.

1744
01:19:54,255 --> 01:19:56,791
I know.

1745
01:19:56,859 --> 01:19:58,260
- This is supposed
to be positive.

1746
01:19:58,327 --> 01:20:00,529
- Is it?
- Yes.

1747
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:02,398
This is a positive, seeing you.

1748
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:08,003
- Yeah.

1749
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,150
- This was not my intention

1750
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:12,007
to put you on the spot
or anything.

1751
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:14,175
I just wanted to tell you
how I feel, that's all.

1752
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,416
- I think, like, in the spirit
of being honest,

1753
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:23,886
like, we talked about this
off-camera.

1754
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:26,955
- What do you mean?

1755
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:29,892
- Like, I feel like
we were able to have,

1756
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:34,129
like, an honest conversation
about it in Fantasy Suites.

1757
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:37,866
So you brought me here
to tell me it again?

1758
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:40,869
- No, this is not why
I brought you here at all.

1759
01:20:46,275 --> 01:20:47,876
I'm...

1760
01:20:50,813 --> 01:20:52,348
- I don't know.

1761
01:20:56,485 --> 01:20:58,320
- I mean, you do know.

1762
01:21:00,621 --> 01:21:03,492
- I feel
so frustrated right now.

1763
01:21:03,559 --> 01:21:05,861
Erich expressed to me
in the Fantasy Suite

1764
01:21:05,928 --> 01:21:08,330
that this week feels
like I'm cheating,

1765
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:12,101
and now I feel like we're
rehashing the conversation

1766
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:14,169
and I'm being pressured.

1767
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:16,871
Him being like,
"I don't you to have

1768
01:21:16,939 --> 01:21:18,639
what we have
with somebody else,"

1769
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:21,143
well, that's, like,
not for you to say.

1770
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:23,746
You're here knowing that I could

1771
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:26,548
have it with somebody else.

1772
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:28,126
- I mean, I don't know
what's happened this week,

1773
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:30,753
but, like, I can't just,
like, pretend like

1774
01:21:30,818 --> 01:21:33,088
I'm cool with everything and...

1775
01:21:33,155 --> 01:21:34,933
- I don't know, like,
what you want to me to say

1776
01:21:34,957 --> 01:21:36,458
or, like, if you feel
like I need

1777
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:38,627
to prove something to you.

1778
01:21:38,693 --> 01:21:41,430
Because I think, like,
I'm always as, like, honest

1779
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:42,898
and open as I can be.

1780
01:21:42,965 --> 01:21:46,068
And if you want to get into it,
we can get into it now.

1781
01:21:46,135 --> 01:21:47,603
- I really don't.

1782
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:55,686
I didn't want to put
anything on you.

1783
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:56,954
And I'm sorry...
This is not the way

1784
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:58,480
I thought this was gonna go.

1785
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:00,082
- Like, I know
where your heart is

1786
01:22:00,148 --> 01:22:03,218
and, like, I know, like,
what you're trying to say,

1787
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:05,387
but, like, we did have
this conversation

1788
01:22:05,454 --> 01:22:06,534
when it was just you and I,

1789
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:09,224
and, like, now I can talk
to you about it,

1790
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:12,261
but then I feel like
I would be defending myself.

1791
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,963
- That's not the point at all.

1792
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:16,565
It was literally
just to see you.

1793
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:17,809
But now that I see you,
I'm like,

1794
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:19,902
I don't want to let you go.

1795
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:24,639
- I don't know.

1796
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:28,309
It just doesn't feel good
right now.

1797
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:32,380
Why do I always
have to defend myself?

1798
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:35,751
It's like, why don't you trust
what we have?

1799
01:22:35,818 --> 01:22:38,320
- It was not my intention
to, like,

1800
01:22:38,387 --> 01:22:39,621
have any sort of ultimatum

1801
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:40,899
or anything like that,
but I need you to know

1802
01:22:40,923 --> 01:22:42,925
how I feel
because I can't just, like,

1803
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:45,527
go through this whole week
being like, everything's fine.

1804
01:22:47,396 --> 01:22:50,499
- I feel like he was testing me.

1805
01:22:50,566 --> 01:22:53,268
And that's, like,
not something you do

1806
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:55,471
to someone that you love.

1807
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:58,507
Maybe he's not gonna
be my guy after all.

1808
01:22:58,574 --> 01:23:00,709
I'm starting to question it.

1809
01:23:00,776 --> 01:23:04,680
And I'm terrified
'cause what if I realize

1810
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:07,082
that Jason isn't my guy either?

1811
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:08,884
Now it's right
in front of my face,

1812
01:23:08,951 --> 01:23:11,153
my person might not be here.

1813
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:13,789
'Cause it seems like the people

1814
01:23:13,856 --> 01:23:16,758
that I want to love me never do.

1815
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,495
It's just, like,
all coming crashing down,

1816
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:24,066
and I hope this doesn't end up
in a big, fat dumpster fire.

1817
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:27,603
But right now, this feels
like the end for me.

1818
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:33,775
I feel like I have, like,
walls and barriers and...

1819
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:35,644
I don't know.

1820
01:23:45,454 --> 01:23:48,857
- Tomorrow night
on "The Bachelorette"...

1821
01:23:48,924 --> 01:23:52,127
- I'm having a lot
of anxiety this week.

1822
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:55,163
I do have those fears
of leaving here alone.

1823
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:57,799
- After Fantasy Suite,
everything took, like, a 180.

1824
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,201
I felt blindsided.

1825
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:01,202
That was the last thing
I could've ever expected.

1826
01:24:02,603 --> 01:24:03,915
- I don't necessarily know
where we are.

1827
01:24:03,939 --> 01:24:05,707
To feel this strong
about somebody and know

1828
01:24:05,773 --> 01:24:07,675
that, like, you could lose
that person?

1829
01:24:07,743 --> 01:24:09,111
That's a horrible feeling.

1830
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:12,948
- This whole time
has been really hard.

1831
01:24:13,014 --> 01:24:15,150
It does take
kind of the right person

1832
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:16,552
to know how to love me.

1833
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:19,388
- I don't fully feel like
I know who you are.

1834
01:24:21,757 --> 01:24:24,526
- Gabby will not be joining you.

1835
01:24:24,593 --> 01:24:26,395
You're gonna be
the only Bachelorette here.

1836
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:28,797
- I don't know
what it is about me

1837
01:24:28,864 --> 01:24:31,400
that's so hard to love.

1838
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:34,068
Am I too broken
for anyone to love?

1839
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:39,074
- It all continues
tomorrow night.

1840
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:40,943
- I was so excited
for this week,

1841
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:43,378
but I have been, like,
dreading this week.

1842
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:44,446
- Yeah.

1843
01:24:44,513 --> 01:24:45,953
I'm just terrified
that it's gonna...

1844
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:49,985
- We have a friend!

1845
01:24:50,052 --> 01:24:52,654
Oh, my God,
he's actually fearless.

1846
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:56,725
- I don't want him
to bite my ankles.

1847
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:58,727
- Should we gave it champagne?

1848
01:24:58,794 --> 01:25:00,362
- Oh, my God, he's gonna jump.

1849
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:02,197
- Oh, there he goes.

1850
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:03,498
I don't know.

1851
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:05,276
It's something I think
that we'll have to see,

1852
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,702
like, if conversation comes up.

1853
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:08,637
Personally, like,
my conversation with Erich

1854
01:25:08,704 --> 01:25:10,105
is gonna look
completely different

1855
01:25:10,172 --> 01:25:11,505
than my conversation with Jason.

1856
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:13,575
That's gonna look different
than with Johnny.

1857
01:25:13,642 --> 01:25:15,243
- I agree.

1858
01:25:15,309 --> 01:25:16,878
- Yeah, so it's like...
- Whoa!

1859
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,880
That is...

1860
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:21,016
- Oh, it likes pineapple!

1861
01:25:23,552 --> 01:25:24,686
He jumped so high!

1862
01:25:24,753 --> 01:25:26,021
- Positive reinforcement.

1863
01:25:26,088 --> 01:25:28,523
That thing is brave as hell.

1864
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:30,993
He had it right in his mouth.

1865
01:25:31,059 --> 01:25:32,693
- Literally, they're like dogs.

1866
01:25:32,761 --> 01:25:34,396
It's so happy with himself.

1867
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:35,964
Look, it's gonna go take a nap.

1868
01:25:36,031 --> 01:25:37,032
- It's like...

1869
01:25:37,099 --> 01:25:39,234
- Yeah, literally licking
his chops.

1870
01:25:39,258 --> 01:25:41,258
