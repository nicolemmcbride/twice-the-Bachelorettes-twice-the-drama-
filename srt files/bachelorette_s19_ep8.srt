1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:04,505
- Tonight,
on a very special episode

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,973
of "The Bachelorette"...

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,208
- I guess I like girls that are
rough around the edges.

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:10,878
- All of your favorite men
from the season are back...

5
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,279
- You had your chance.

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,186
Have some respect
for the guys that were there.

7
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,316
- And they're ready
to talk smack.

8
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,152
- You did mislead Rachel
throughout the whole process.

9
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,054
- Were you hoping
for Gabby's rose?

10
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,223
- He was condescending,
calling them "females."

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,526
- That was absurd...
- Let me speak. Let me speak.

12
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,328
- Roby, you were at the mansion
for four hours for a reason.

13
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:29,995
- Would you have kept me
with blond hair?

14
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,267
- Yes. No, just kidding!

15
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,303
- Rachel, the relationship
didn't really make sense to me.

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,572
- We had a connection,
and I think you did me wrong.

17
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,340
- You were still
entertaining both sides.

18
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,409
- If you think
you know what happens...

19
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,811
Meatball, Meatball,
Meatball, Meatball!

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,513
- Guess again.

21
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,580
- Oh, no!

22
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:48,782
- Oh!

23
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,485
It's a night full of surprises.

24
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:56,223
This news is about to change
your lives forever.

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,161
Are you ready to hear
what I'm about to say?

26
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,831
So let's all raise our glasses

27
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,268
and toast to new adventures!

28
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,004
And it all starts right now.

29
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,518
- Good evening.

30
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,920
Thanks for coming.

31
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:29,523
So great seeing you. Thank you.

32
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,826
All right.

33
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,295
Good evening, Bachelor Nation.
It's so great being here.

34
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,164
I'm Jesse Palmer, and welcome

35
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,865
to what promises to be
a dramatic

36
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,869
and, dare I say it,
shocking "Men Tell All."

37
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,639
That's right.

38
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,274
Now, of course, history was made

39
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,651
earlier this year
when we introduced

40
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,044
not one, but two Bachelorettes,

41
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,748
and so far, this season really
has lived up to all the hype.

42
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,250
We've had double the drama,
double the tears.

43
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,420
We've had double the romance
and hopefully not one,

44
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,056
but two engagements.

45
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,728
So how's this all gonna end?

46
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,262
Well, later tonight,
you're gonna get

47
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,264
a sneak peek
that will definitely have

48
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,534
all of Bachelor Nation in tears.

49
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,838
So, of course,
Gabby and Rachel are here.

50
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,640
That's right.

51
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,508
And so are all
of your favorite guys,

52
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,944
ready to hit the stage
and tell all.

53
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,312
We got so much to cover tonight,

54
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,247
but first,
before the drama unfolds,

55
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,782
we do have
some unfinished business

56
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:29,983
that we have to get to.

57
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,252
Last week,
you saw all of the Hometowns.

58
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,688
You saw all of them
except for one.

59
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:38,091
Rachel is now about to meet
Aven in Salem, Massachusetts.

60
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,435
And I'm not gonna give
anything away,

61
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,428
but here is a hint.

62
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,829
It's cursed.

63
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,865
I'm being serious. It is.
You don't believe me?

64
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,199
Take a look.

65
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,782
- Today, we are here
in Aven's hometown,

66
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,850
Salem, Massachusetts,

67
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,585
and I'm just nervous

68
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:09,623
because my last Hometown
with Tino

69
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,659
didn't go as I planned.

70
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,795
It was really difficult.

71
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,963
His family, they do not like me,

72
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,900
as much as he wants
to tell me they do.

73
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,436
And with Tyler, it was so tough

74
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,705
to break up with someone
on a Hometown,

75
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:28,508
but I know that it was
the right decision.

76
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,244
Aven is someone I have

77
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,146
an extremely strong
connection with.

78
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,449
Hello.
- Hi.

79
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,084
Oh, my God.

80
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,486
- I can absolutely see
a future with him.

81
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,054
- You doing okay?
- Yeah.

82
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,256
I'm just really excited
to spend the day with him

83
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,125
and to meet his family
later tonight.

84
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,536
I'm a little bit more nervous
for that.

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
- Welcome to Mass.

86
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,463
Salem has such a rich history,

87
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,065
and I wanted to explore it
together today.

88
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,067
- I'm ready.
- I'm so happy.

89
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,003
- But I am so excited
to see Aven.

90
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,206
I feel like today,

91
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,842
I'd fully expect his parents
to be skeptical.

92
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,246
My fears are that
they just won't like me.

93
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:10,250
They don't like this process.
They just don't trust it.

94
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:14,020
So that is of course a fear
for me tonight, for sure.

95
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,958
I am very excited for tonight,
but I'll be completely honest.

96
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,894
- Yeah.
- I'm really nervous.

97
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,497
- Okay. Is there, like,
a specific reason why?

98
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:27,400
- You told me last week
that your parents both

99
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,770
didn't approve
of a couple of exes.

100
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,004
How many...

101
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,281
- I've only had
two serious relationships.

102
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,716
- And both of them
they didn't approve of.

103
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,941
- Not both parents.

104
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,619
I don't want you to go
into tonight nervous.

105
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,278
I want you to be excited
because...

106
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,856
- I am excited too.
- It's gonna be fun.

107
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,524
Obviously, like, meeting
the parents is nerve-racking,

108
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,049
regardless of the situation,

109
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,556
but I definitely don't want you
to go in there thinking, like,

110
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,621
"Oh, they disapproved
of his last two girlfriends,

111
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,931
so what are they gonna think"...

112
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,824
That's not how this is
at all, I promise you.

113
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:51,892
- Okay.
- I promise you.

114
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,927
- So when, or ever,
was there a time

115
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,863
they both met someone
at the same time?

116
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,765
- No. There hasn't been.
- Okay.

117
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,233
- Oh, yeah,
you're the first one.

118
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,903
- Okay.
- At the same time, yeah.

119
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,672
My parents literally haven't,
like, been together

120
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,016
since I, like,
graduated college,

121
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,484
like, in the same room
together, so it's been,

122
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,876
like, six or seven... six years.

123
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,111
- Oh, wow.

124
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,421
- I didn't even think
about that aspect of it.

125
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,680
Like, yeah, that's huge.

126
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,091
Rachel is someone
that's very special

127
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,284
to me now at this point,
so it's very important

128
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,752
getting my parents' approval.

129
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,921
They're the two most
important people in my life,

130
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,291
but I could sense a little bit
of nerves coming from Rachel.

131
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,359
So I got some stuff
planned today

132
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,346
that hopefully will calm
her nerves a little bit.

133
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,935
- After you.

134
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,905
Oh.

135
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,107
This is so cool.

136
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,443
Oh, my gosh,
should we get crystals?

137
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,945
Oh, this one's for passion.

138
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,713
Okay, we definitely need
one of these.

139
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,148
- Hi.
- Hi!

140
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,592
- Hello.
- Welcome to Crow Haven Corner.

141
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,884
- How are you?
- Hello.

142
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,619
- How you guys doing today?
- Good.

143
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,955
- Well, this is
the oldest shop in Salem.

144
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,523
In fact, the country.

145
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,825
And I'm what you call
the love witch of Salem.

146
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,427
- Ooh.
- So, you know,

147
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,295
I'm just looking at you,
and I'm like,

148
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,231
"This is all about love,
I can tell."

149
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,832
And I'm like "You know what?

150
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,968
I gotta tell you
about my famous love spell."

151
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,836
I could do it for you,
if you like.

152
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:10,904
- Yeah.

153
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:11,905
- I would love to see the spell.

154
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,206
Absolutely.
- Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,975
Okay, it would be my pleasure.

156
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,561
Just come with me, okay?
- I'm excited.

157
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,579
I've never done
anything like this.

158
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:23,683
But I am the most nervous
to meet Aven's family.

159
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,653
So when it comes to love
with Aven,

160
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,555
I will try anything.

161
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:31,892
- Right now, I can tell you
that you're extremely nervous.

162
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,161
I want you to remember
that your words have power.

163
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,930
And today,
you must take your power

164
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,365
and speak your words.

165
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,934
Know that it's okay
to say what you feel.

166
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,637
'Cause if you don't,
there's only so much time.

167
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,505
And lots of passion too.

168
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,741
He's romantic,
just a little shy.

169
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,477
- She did tell Aven
he needs to open up more.

170
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,712
And Aven is the one
who has told me

171
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,848
the least about how he feels.

172
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,918
- So right away, Rachel,
you're a giver.

173
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:01,254
But what I can pick up
about you is, you need clarity.

174
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:04,357
And so you definitely need that
to start today.

175
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,260
And I want you to follow
your heart and your soul

176
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,262
and most of all your instincts.

177
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,298
In honor of both of you today,

178
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,866
I ask for love and light

179
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,968
and the correct love
for both of you

180
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,504
and to have a wonderful,
beautiful, magical night.

181
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,506
- Wow.
- Whoa.

182
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,911
- So I want you guys both
to follow your hearts.

183
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,680
I enjoyed doing this
with you today.

184
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:27,948
- Thank you.

185
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,417
- And I wish the both of youse
the best of luck.

186
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,727
- Aww, thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

187
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,262
This is incredible.
- Merry meet. Merry part.

188
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,688
May we all meet again.

189
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,990
Yes.

190
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,459
- I'm gonna leave now,
and thank you...

191
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,664
Oh, no! Not the fire!

192
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:45,841
- Oh, my God.
- It stays burning.

193
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,701
- I knew that thing
was gonna fall.

194
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,437
The table didn't break, though.
- Is it bad that that happened?

195
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,172
- Can someone help me
with the table?

196
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,974
- Oh, gosh.

197
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,909
- Is that bad luck if it fell?

198
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,578
Our love spell just tumbled
to the floor.

199
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,214
I don't know what that means.

200
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,284
I just hope it's not a bad sign.

201
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,452
Let's pray for tonight.

202
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,821
Oh, my God. Whoa.

203
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,694
- Welcome back
to the "Men Tell All."

204
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,430
Now, the guys are all
anxiously awaiting backstage,

205
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,866
and if you think you saw
fireworks this season,

206
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,701
just wait until later tonight.

207
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:26,339
Does Logan regret switching
from Team Rachel to Team Gabby?

208
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,508
Gonna ask him about that.
And then what about Nate?

209
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,410
Has he recovered
from that devastating breakup

210
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:31,778
with Gabby in Amsterdam?

211
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,047
And will he also address
the rumors about him

212
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,583
that have been running rampant
on social media recently?

213
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,518
And then of course
there's Hayden.

214
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,122
Will the man who enraged
all of Bachelor Nation

215
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,791
with his inappropriate behavior
even show up tonight?

216
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,159
Just wait and see.

217
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,495
But first, Rachel is about
to meet Aven's parents.

218
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,698
So will she be
welcomed with open arms,

219
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,167
or is she gonna need
to cast a spell?

220
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,202
Let's find out.

221
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,614
- So we're going in.

222
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,416
- Okay. Remind me again.

223
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,418
- Yes, we're gonna meet
my mom, Dawn...

224
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,053
- Okay.
- And my dad, Arthur.

225
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,454
You ready?
- I'm ready.

226
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,989
- I'm excited.

227
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,059
- Aven's parents are gonna
be there together tonight,

228
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,693
and in his previous
relationships,

229
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,630
they have never met
someone at the same time.

230
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,132
And neither of his parents
have approved

231
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,101
of partners in the past.

232
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:33,206
So walking in tonight,
I truly am shaking.

233
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,008
Like, my teeth were chattering.

234
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,677
This is a huge deal to me

235
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,346
because his parents could be
my future in-laws.

236
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,981
This is a big deal.

237
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,484
- There they are.
- Oh, my gosh.

238
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,419
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.

239
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,621
- Meeting some
of the other families

240
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:52,759
didn't go as I planned,
so tonight with Aven,

241
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,128
I really just want them
to like me.

242
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,630
- From the bottom of my heart,
it's so good to see

243
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:01,267
both of you here,
like, at the same time,

244
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,570
like, fully supporting me
in all of this,

245
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,371
and I'm so honored to introduce

246
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,906
this special girl
to you both, so...

247
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,775
- Oh, sweet.
- Cheers.

248
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,910
- Thank you.
- Awesome. Cheers.

249
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:14,514
Well, Aven, we were
so excited to see you.

250
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,058
- Yeah, it's really good
to see both of you.

251
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,584
- We were really excited to see

252
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,352
who you brought
through the doorway.

253
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:22,489
And we are so happy to meet you

254
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,824
and hopefully get to know you
a little better tonight

255
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,093
and wish both of you
all the best

256
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,295
on whatever this journey is
for you.

257
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,998
- We've had quite the journey.
- Yeah.

258
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,934
The first night, like, I got
the chance to talk to her,

259
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,336
and, like, within,

260
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,842
I don't even know,
like, ten seconds,

261
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,115
I was like "Yeah,
she's really"...

262
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,574
- Ten seconds?
- Ten seconds.

263
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,010
She's, like, so cool
and I just, like, immediately

264
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,512
was like,
"Oh, this is perfect."

265
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,579
I, like, knew.

266
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,115
- How did you feel
at the beginning?

267
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,184
- I mean, straight out
the limo, it was like,

268
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,386
"Okay, we're off
to a great start."

269
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,688
I definitely could not wait
to talk to him,

270
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,790
but as soon as we talked
to each other,

271
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,693
I feel like we definitely had
a connection.

272
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,030
- Right now,
the dinners and the hotels

273
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,599
and the travels
around the world,

274
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,836
that's all great, well,
and fine, and it's fun,

275
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,337
but in real life,
that kind of stuff

276
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,306
doesn't happen all the time.

277
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,050
Rachel, you want to come
and have a chat with me

278
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,010
at the bar for a moment?
- Yes.

279
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,846
- So we need to be honed in
on, "This is great,

280
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,048
"but how does this fit
into my life?

281
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,783
How does this fit
into the real world?"

282
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,490
Those are questions
they need to be asking

283
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:26,953
themselves and each other.

284
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,689
I know you've been
through this process before,

285
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,457
so I have
some questions for you.

286
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,028
What attracts you
to Aven as a person?

287
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,364
- There's something about Aven
I truly can't describe,

288
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,066
but he's just
so incredible, honestly.

289
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,301
- Okay.

290
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,403
- I just feel like
we have so much in common,

291
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,139
just on a level of what we want

292
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,707
and how we want
to raise a family

293
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:48,984
and how we want
to live our lives.

294
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,111
- Based on those things,

295
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:56,015
do you see this being something

296
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,451
you can bring
into the real world?

297
00:11:58,518 --> 00:11:59,719
- Absolutely.

298
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:03,323
I have absolutely thought
about my future with Aven

299
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,226
and we've talked about things
we want in the future

300
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,261
and what a family
would look like

301
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,796
and what our life
would look like

302
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,182
with my job, with his job, and...

303
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,298
- Yes.

304
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,009
- It is something
that we have talked about

305
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,402
because as much as it is
a fantasy,

306
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,538
it's all about
getting to that point

307
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:21,641
of engagement and reality,
and for me, it's serious

308
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:26,112
because when I get engaged,
that's it for me.

309
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,214
And he said that
for himself as well.

310
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,550
He's like "I would never
get down on one knee

311
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,719
if I wasn't 100% serious."

312
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,154
- It's nice to hear that you're
looking for the same things.

313
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,889
- Absolutely.

314
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:41,461
- So are you
earnestly, sincerely,

315
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:46,099
whole-heartedly ready
to commit to love

316
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:49,002
with Aven?

317
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,872
- My feelings for Aven
are so strong.

318
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,208
I truly do see
a future with him.

319
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,576
- Okay.

320
00:12:56,643 --> 00:13:00,280
- But can I sit here right now
and be, like, 100%?

321
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,248
No. I can't, to be honest.

322
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,483
- Fair enough.

323
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,785
- But our relationship
is just so special.

324
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,720
I'm excited to see
where it goes.

325
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,022
- Okay.

326
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,491
- I do think the conversation
with Aven's dad

327
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:15,194
is going really well,
but I am the most nervous

328
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,397
to meet Aven's mom, Dawn.

329
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,333
They definitely do have
a really strong relationship.

330
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,137
So I do still fully expect
hard questions.

331
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,639
- You've got three others?

332
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,342
- Yeah, it definitely is...

333
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,729
- Do you feel different
with Aven?

334
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,680
Are you on the same level
with all of them right now?

335
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,082
- There are still other people
here, absolutely,

336
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,318
and that's just a part
of this process

337
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,286
and something
I've never experienced,

338
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,956
but with Aven,
I feel so strongly for him.

339
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,826
And he is so special.

340
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,463
And I would never bring him
into this position

341
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,933
and have family involved
if I didn't truly see

342
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,102
a future with him
outside of this.

343
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,037
- I feel that about you.

344
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:02,041
To see him come in and display
that much affection

345
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:05,211
when he walked in with you was...

346
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,347
That was right here,
that hit me right here.

347
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,716
So the fact that he has
brought you here

348
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:14,020
says a very powerful message
to both me and his father

349
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,356
about who you are to him.

350
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,758
- How did your conversation go
with Rachel?

351
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,094
- It went well.
- It went very well? Okay.

352
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,995
- I asked her
some tough questions and...

353
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,364
Oh, you asked...

354
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,432
- I have to say, she stood up
to 'em pretty good.

355
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,768
- That means something to me.
- Okay.

356
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:34,374
Do you, Aven Jones,
think that you are ready

357
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,008
to take this to the next level?

358
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,945
Which means engagement
and potentially marriage.

359
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,881
Are you ready for that
with Rachel?

360
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:45,985
- Loaded question, but yeah,
I am getting to that point.

361
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,120
I am.

362
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,088
If I get the validation
from Rachel

363
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,891
to getting to the end of this
and being...

364
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,594
Like, her showing me that
she feels the same way as I do

365
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,765
and that she sees
a future with me,

366
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,533
I feel like
that's enough validation

367
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,934
to trust that connection.

368
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,169
- Okay.
- And... yeah.

369
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,004
- I like her.
I hope it works out.

370
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,739
She's great.
She's welcome to the family.

371
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,086
Don't stop fighting
for her, man,

372
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,642
'cause she's a good catch.

373
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,844
- Tonight couldn't have gone
any better.

374
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,448
Both my parents 100% approved
of her as a person

375
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,083
and someone who's right for me.

376
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,252
Yeah, I got that today,
for sure.

377
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,053
You seem a little more relaxed.

378
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,789
- No, I feel so much better.

379
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,857
I was actually shaking
coming in here.

380
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,225
- I know.

381
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,127
Rachel, she's somebody
that I want to spend

382
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,796
the rest of my life with.

383
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,173
And I think this is
a perfect time

384
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,900
to let her know how I'm feeling.

385
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,002
Oh, my gosh,
this is such a good night.

386
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,079
- I know.
- Like, I'm so glad

387
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,204
that you liked them.

388
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,748
- So you don't have
any, like, doubts,

389
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,341
or, like, you feel good about
everything that they said?

390
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,943
- I have zero doubts.

391
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,612
Seeing the look
on my parents' face,

392
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,015
they see how happy
I am with you.

393
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,450
And it's just...

394
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,127
This night just meant
the world to me, I swear.

395
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:55,721
Like, my feelings are getting
really, really strong.

396
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,592
And I, like... I am, like,
falling in love with you.

397
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,063
I am. I really am.

398
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,032
- Oh, my gosh,
hearing you say that

399
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,835
is the most incredible feeling.

400
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,337
You have no idea

401
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,307
what hearing you say this means

402
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:19,245
because I feel like you are
obviously slow to open up.

403
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,446
- I am.

404
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:22,014
- And I've always
just been like,

405
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,916
"I want him to tell me
how he feels,"

406
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,319
and I'm so happy right now.

407
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,421
- From the bottom of my heart,
I mean it.

408
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,325
- I feel so lucky right now.

409
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,161
Aven is falling in love with me.

410
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,797
And it makes me so happy

411
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:41,200
because I have wanted him
to say that

412
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,602
for a really long time.

413
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,071
And it means everything to me.

414
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,239
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

415
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,107
- Be safe.

416
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,210
- I do feel like I am
falling in love with Aven.

417
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,616
I feel really confident
this could be it.

418
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,518
This could be my happy ending.

419
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,390
- Wow.

420
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,602
It looks like Rachel and Aven
are totally falling in love,

421
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,395
but with such strong feelings
for all of the remaining guys,

422
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,064
did Aven get a rose
at the Rose Ceremony?

423
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,866
Well, I got a spoiler for you:

424
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,268
he did.

425
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,837
In fact,
all of Rachel's guys did.

426
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,105
Yeah.

427
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,907
So did all of Gabby's.

428
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,376
Now, look, I know you haven't
seen the Rose Ceremony yet,

429
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,344
but guess what, you're not
gonna see it tonight.

430
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,889
We just have way too many
things to get to,

431
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,614
but I told you
from the beginning,

432
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,526
Gabby and Rachel, they wanted
to call all the shots.

433
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,118
They decided
that after their Hometowns,

434
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,686
they weren't sending
anybody home.

435
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,155
They wanted to keep
all of their men.

436
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,024
You want to see
how it all went down?

437
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,860
You can check it out
on abc.com.

438
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,329
Okay, when we come back,
it's finally time

439
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,997
to hear from the men.

440
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,600
What was it like dating
two Bachelorettes at once?

441
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,969
How do the guys really feel
about Hayden telling Gabby

442
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,771
she's rough around the edges?

443
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,306
Whoo! Look out, Hayden.

444
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,041
Rambo's not here
to protect you, brother.

445
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,643
All that and more when
the "Men Tell All" returns.

446
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,990
Hi, and welcome back
to the "Men Tell All."

447
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,725
Now, look,
you've all been so patient,

448
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,528
and I promise you
it's been totally worth it

449
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,463
because the moment
you've been waiting for

450
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,965
is finally here.

451
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,401
It's finally time
for the men to tell all.

452
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,469
Everybody ready for this?

453
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,709
Well, please welcome Roby.

454
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,678
Whoa.

455
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,647
Jordan H.

456
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,649
Termayne.

457
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,684
Jacob.

458
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,686
Jordan V.

459
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,688
Alec.

460
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,690
Quincey.

461
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,892
Ethan.

462
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,995
Spencer.

463
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,030
Mario.

464
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,032
Meatball.

465
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,201
Logan.

466
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,303
Tyler.

467
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,472
And Nate.

468
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,243
All right, well, gentlemen,

469
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,945
it's so good
seeing you all here.

470
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,456
I think the last time
I saw most of you,

471
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,991
we were on a cruise ship,
we were sailing along

472
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,750
the northern coast of Europe.

473
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,917
Dude, I'll tell you what,

474
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,020
I never saw this goatee,
though, Spencer.

475
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,021
I'm digging the new goat.

476
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,288
- Oh, you liking it?
- Yeah.

477
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,399
- That means a lot
coming from you.

478
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:18,663
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

479
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:19,825
- It's a good look.

480
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,412
Did any of you know
that that was Roby?

481
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,460
No.

482
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
- He surprised us all, actually.

483
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,698
- I did not notice you
with the platinum hair.

484
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,042
- I was in the bathroom
getting ready.

485
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,668
I'm like, who the is this?

486
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,870
- Well, listen,
there's so much to get to.

487
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,147
Let's go back to the beginning.

488
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,540
Let's start.
And Nate, I'll start with you.

489
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,051
It's gotta be tough
being in the limo,

490
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,519
you're headed to the mansion
thinking that

491
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,011
you have to leave
this impression.

492
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,622
It'd be tough enough
on one Bachelorette.

493
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,048
Where was your mindset knowing

494
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,350
that you were about to meet two?

495
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:49,188
- My mindset was kind of like,
"Just don't pass out."

496
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,856
I was literally
walking up to them,

497
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,825
but I was just met
with such a warm embrace

498
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,560
that it kind of
just felt natural

499
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,095
and I was able to be myself.

500
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:58,140
- You know, I had nothing
but respect for both of them,

501
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,366
I think they did an amazing job,

502
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,902
and there's nothing
that they should look back on

503
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,913
and think that they have
to change, 'cause I just think

504
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,305
they did it perfectly.

505
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:10,810
Yeah.

506
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,013
Logan, what was the best part
of dating two Bachelorettes?

507
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,415
Um, the lessons learned.

508
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,217
I had to say something.

509
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:19,895
Thanks for asking, Jess.
- Yeah, you got it.

510
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,721
Don't worry, that won't be
the last question

511
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,456
I ask about that either.

512
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,067
All right, well,
I think we can all agree

513
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,626
that this was definitely
a crazy experience, right?

514
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,329
With two Bachelorettes,
we really did have

515
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,664
double everything.

516
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,333
We had double the romance,
double the man tears,

517
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,636
and, of course,
double the drama.

518
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,140
Whoa!

519
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:42,508
- There's two Bachelorettes.

520
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,176
- This is like
history in the making.

521
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,711
- Surprise!

522
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,113
- This is amazing.

523
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,648
I have two opportunities
with two stunning women.

524
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:50,916
How is this gonna work?

525
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,284
You better choose wisely.

526
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,886
- I just felt, like,

527
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,355
a really good connection
with Rachel.

528
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,024
And I really do want
to pursue that.

529
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,661
- I do have
my intentions for Rachel.

530
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:03,929
- Yeah.

531
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,632
- And I think you have
a little bit more, like...

532
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,834
I want to say
rough around the edges.

533
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,704
- Like, even if, like, say,
you were the only person here,

534
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,340
I don't think I could have
the heart to continue.

535
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,876
But obviously, like,
you're smoking.

536
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,410
- Yeah.

537
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,180
I think these guys saying
that because I'm different

538
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:25,584
they don't want to be with me
is, like, validating

539
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,320
that I may be too much
for people.

540
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,523
- Will you accept this rose?

541
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,792
- I'm sorry. I cannot.

542
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:33,959
I'm here for Gabby.

543
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,199
- I am gonna have
to decline your rose.

544
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,001
- Did somebody else say no?

545
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,336
- I gotta follow my heart,
and I'm sorry.

546
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,172
- Rachel being rejected
by some of the men

547
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,542
at the Rose Ceremony,
that was very uncomfortable.

548
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:56,048
I didn't ever expect
to be Bachelorette

549
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,651
and then to be rejected again
multiple times.

550
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,820
After you already feel like
you don't deserve it,

551
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,254
it's hard.

552
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,025
Logan.

553
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:10,062
- She gave me a rose,
and I feel like the bad guy.

554
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,598
- Logan,
will you accept this rose?

555
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,401
- But if it means
I get to talk with Gabby,

556
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,771
I would be a fool
not to accept a rose.

557
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,606
The heart wants what it wants.

558
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,943
I've come back
to thinking about you.

559
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,477
- Yeah.

560
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,446
- After talking to her
for 20 seconds,

561
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,281
I realized why I was
doing all this.

562
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,318
Fortune favors the bold.

563
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,386
Oh!

564
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:35,955
- How's everybody?

565
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,557
- I was shocked
when Logan came in.

566
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:39,859
No guy's gonna want to hear

567
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,361
that another man is being added
to the mix.

568
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:45,598
I just didn't see that coming,
you know, from Logan.

569
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,433
I thought he was, like,
crazy about Rachel.

570
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,237
- Logan, he is indecisive.

571
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,539
It just shows a reflection
of his character.

572
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,175
But, you know, drama's always
creeping somewhere, right?

573
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,544
- Like, for me it would be
a deal-breaker if we got down

574
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,280
to the final four,
which I plan to be in,

575
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:02,948
and we go in the Fantasy Suite

576
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:04,483
and we have
this sexual experience

577
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,019
and then she decides
that she's gonna have sex

578
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:08,988
with multiple people
and feel it out,

579
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,624
that would be the situation
where I'd go, "Okay, I'm out."

580
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,058
- What Chris said, I was pissed.

581
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,236
First off,
you shouldn't be talking

582
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,661
about Fantasy Suites anyway.

583
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:16,905
Clearly you're not here
for the right reasons.

584
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:19,098
They don't deserve
what you just said.

585
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,967
Like, if you're gonna put them
through that, go home.

586
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,612
- Do you feel like
it's appropriate to be talking

587
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,337
about Fantasy Suites this early?

588
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,240
- I'm not taking away
anybody's else decision,

589
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,151
and that's something
that I would never want to do

590
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,720
to a female
is take away their decision.

591
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,380
- I understand that you're
thinking way far in advance.

592
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,882
We can help make this decision
at this point.

593
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:39,318
I don't want anyone to be
thinking about Fantasy Suites.

594
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:40,586
It's so early.

595
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:42,354
We don't even know
if we have a connection.

596
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,557
I do think it would be time
for you to go.

597
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,393
- Chris is playing
the villain in the house,

598
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,895
and who's gonna be
the next Chris?

599
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,106
Like, who's gonna be
the next one

600
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,607
that actually shows
their true colors?

601
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,800
- Gabby's the one
that used the word

602
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,068
"rough around the edges."

603
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,270
And my dumb ass uses
the same verbiage

604
00:23:58,337 --> 00:23:59,905
that Gabby uses
to describe herself,

605
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,974
and she didn't like that.

606
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,818
Well, bitch, maybe you
shouldn't use that word

607
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,244
to describe yourself, then.

608
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,412
- Oh, my God.

609
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,748
- I've been comparing my ex
to, like...

610
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,617
Like, this, right?

611
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,118
They don't hold a candle to her.

612
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,322
- Hearing this
from Hayden is disturbing

613
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,324
and that doesn't
sit well with me.

614
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,193
- After what was said
about Gabby in LA,

615
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,630
you went and said
"I can't trust these bitches"?

616
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,775
- That's not what I said.
- I just don't believe you.

617
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,968
Can I walk you out?
- Yes.

618
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:32,104
- Hayden, it shocked me
because what he said,

619
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,640
it was absolutely insane.

620
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:35,941
It's mind-blowing.

621
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:47,386
- All right, we obviously have
a lot to unpack here,

622
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,321
so I want to start
with a challenge

623
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:52,057
that I think a lot of men here
were faced with

624
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,592
at some point
during this journey,

625
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,160
and that was
trying to figure out

626
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,197
which of these two women
to pursue.

627
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:01,100
Ethan, it's obvious... we know
that both Rachel and Gabby,

628
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,835
they're both incredible ladies.

629
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:06,038
How hard was it for you
to try to figure out

630
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,273
which of the two
you were gonna pursue?

631
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,744
- You know, I think
in the first, like, two weeks,

632
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,412
it was tough to navigate,

633
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,214
but, you know,
after getting comfortable

634
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,491
and settling in
with each of them,

635
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,883
I think I kind of knew
right away

636
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,194
the direction that I wanted
to head.

637
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,954
So once we set sail
to Europe, I mean,

638
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,223
it was game on with Rachel, so...

639
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,226
- I came there for Gabby
since day one,

640
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:31,030
so to have people
not know what they want,

641
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,865
even if it's two Bachelorettes
or not,

642
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,800
you should know which one
you pair up with.

643
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,635
You should know which one
you like more.

644
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,103
Love has to be true.

645
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,739
- Termayne, when you found out
about the conversation

646
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,841
Jacob had
at the group date in LA...

647
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,309
It was very blunt with Gabby.

648
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,779
When he was explaining
his intentions

649
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,947
to pursue Rachel,
it didn't go over great.

650
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,516
What was your reaction?

651
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,152
- I mean, honestly, I feel like
you were trying to, you know,

652
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,454
steer a line in the grass
right then and there.

653
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:58,824
I just feel like the words
were just completely wrong.

654
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,126
Like "rough around the edges"
was much better

655
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,804
than, like "If you were
the only one here,

656
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,363
then I'd probably leave."

657
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,274
- Jacob, I don't feel like
you were wishy-washy at all.

658
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,542
I just felt that you were
kind of a

659
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,934
the way you addressed it.

660
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,345
- There you go.
- And that's, like, the thing.

661
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:12,504
You were to the point,
but, like, come on, man,

662
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,039
some manners over there.

663
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:18,210
- I... yeah, look, there's
no excuses for my actions.

664
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:22,648
I was rude. I was selfish.
I was ignorant of her feelings.

665
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:25,184
I need to take ownership
on that, that I did mess up.

666
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,686
I just have to learn
and hopefully teach others

667
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,054
to do better as well.

668
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,260
- All right, well,
the group date in Los Angeles,

669
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,905
that obviously wasn't
the only dramatic thing

670
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,339
that happened throughout
the course of the season.

671
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,333
I want to go back
to that infamous Rose Ceremony

672
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,671
where three men,
Meatball, Termayne, and Alec,

673
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,573
all rejected Rachel's rose.

674
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,617
This was the Rose Ceremony
that Gabby and Rachel made

675
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,276
a decision with respect
to which guys

676
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,744
they wanted to continue dating.

677
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,456
And you all understood
and knew that you had

678
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,282
the choice to either accept
or reject their rose.

679
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:00,252
- When Rachel gave me the rose
and she asked me, like,

680
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,097
"So will you accept the rose?"
and I was like "No,

681
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,523
because I have a better
connection with Gabby,"

682
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,859
and, like, when she asked
everybody else, like, nobody...

683
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,528
Well, Meatball did say no,
but Meatball also did

684
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:12,231
go back and, like, try
to rekindle

685
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,866
his way back into the situation,

686
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,067
which worked for him.

687
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,702
But to me,
that's not genuine at all.

688
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,346
That's like, I want to just
be here for the moment,

689
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,471
you know what I mean?

690
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:20,915
- I mean, there was
a lot of questions

691
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,450
going through my head,
you know, to it.

692
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,443
I mean, I came on
open to both of them.

693
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,811
Going into that Rose Ceremony,

694
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,713
I thought if I were
to get a rose,

695
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:28,981
it was gonna be from Gabby.

696
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,183
- That sounds like
you didn't accept the rose

697
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,218
because you thought
Gabby was more into you,

698
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,287
as opposed to you
being more into Gabby.

699
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,756
So, like, who the hell
were you into?

700
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,591
Because, like, if you're
more into Rachel,

701
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,659
then, like, say that.

702
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,094
Be that. Do that. Man up.

703
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,896
Like, have some balls, Meatball.

704
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,322
- I just didn't know
at the moment.

705
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:49,168
- Damn.
- I mean...

706
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,402
- Roby. Roby.

707
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:51,949
- Hey, Roby,
you had your chance, man.

708
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:54,816
Let me speak, let me speak.
- No, but you talked to both...

709
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,084
Shut the up
for a second and let me speak.

710
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,385
- Yo, bro.
- How are you gonna tell me

711
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,820
- to shut the up?
- Let me speak.

712
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,088
- You aren't hearing...
- You know what I'm saying.

713
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,322
- The decision that they made...
- Roby, do this.

714
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,681
Do this.

715
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:03,815
- Yeah, disappear.

716
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,084
- Roby, you were there
at the mansion

717
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,619
for four hours for a reason.

718
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,221
- Yeah.
- I mean, have some respect

719
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:12,591
for the rest of us
who had genuine feelings,

720
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,126
who caught feelings
for these girls

721
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,553
over the course
of two months, man.

722
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,105
- The decisions that they made.
- I'm saying...

723
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:18,473
- Just shows that they made
the right decision.

724
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:19,898
- Exactly.
- Oh, really?

725
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,366
- It's all about decisions, man.

726
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,503
- All right,
I want to switch now

727
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,072
to someone who's not here
with us tonight,

728
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,975
and the reason why is because
I think Gabby and Rachel

729
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:33,245
booted him so hard
out of the mansion

730
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,948
that he didn't dare show up
to this "Men Tell All,"

731
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,083
and of course
I'm talking about Chris.

732
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,994
- Chris was incredibly
out of pocket the whole time.

733
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,887
Like, out of touch with reality.

734
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,055
Just trash.

735
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,299
Like, he didn't help
run the house.

736
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:45,667
He wasn't trying
to make friends with us.

737
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,125
He was trying
to control the women.

738
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,228
He was condescending,
calling them "females."

739
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,529
Like, I hate it every time.

740
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:52,436
It's like he looks at things
so in his own way.

741
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,575
Like, there's a right way
to do everything,

742
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,866
but it's gotta be his way.

743
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,935
And he thinks his
don't stink, but it does,

744
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,136
like his breath.

745
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,404
All right.
- Damn!

746
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,615
- I don't know if any of y'all
got close to him,

747
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,274
but it was bad.
- Damn!

748
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,411
- I think for me,
the biggest part is,

749
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,214
you're saying this thing about
Fantasy Suites, which is weird.

750
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:10,716
It's literally day two.

751
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,619
It came off misogynistic.
Just derogatory.

752
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,320
That's not something
you talk about.

753
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,756
But number two, to know
what happened to these girls

754
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:21,426
a few months ago,
and then to say it right there,

755
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,204
that's one of my biggest
regrets from the show,

756
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,339
is not saying something
to him right then.

757
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:25,297
- I was hoping
he'd get taken down.

758
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:26,665
- That was absurd.

759
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:29,067
- To hear someone reduce
somebody to their counterparts

760
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,403
of what they can only do
for you sexually

761
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,238
is so barbaric,

762
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:35,607
and I'm glad
that you guys brought it up.

763
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,943
Real men hold
other men accountable.

764
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,812
I was saying, Nate.

765
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,048
- All right, listen, we do have
to take a short break.

766
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,350
Coming up later tonight,
Gabby and Rachel are here

767
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,419
to face their men.

768
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:48,486
Can't wait for that.

769
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,955
And after the break,

770
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:52,157
what do the guys have to say
about Hayden?

771
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,259
The man who said
all those nasty things

772
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:58,096
about Gabby and Rachel
that no man ever should say.

773
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,698
But is he gonna show?

774
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:01,565
Well, there's one man
who did show up tonight.

775
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,701
That's Logan.

776
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,245
When we come back,
Logan is gonna open up

777
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,838
about his dramatic decision
to switch Bachelorettes

778
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,141
and all the fallout
that followed.

779
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,909
Does he have any regrets?

780
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,878
We're gonna ask him that
and a lot more

781
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,013
coming up next
on the "Men Tell All."

782
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,365
- Welcome back
to the "Men Tell All,"

783
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:35,567
and things obviously
are definitely

784
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:36,702
heating up right now,

785
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,737
and that's because
we're about to talk

786
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:42,274
about the one man who had
all of Bachelor Nation

787
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,576
clamoring for his dismissal.

788
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,578
You know I'm talking
about Hayden.

789
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,086
He referred to the women
in demeaning terms.

790
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,596
He compared them
to his ex-girlfriend.

791
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,589
He even told Gabby
she was, quote,

792
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,291
"rough around the edges."

793
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,730
So I'm gonna open it up
to you guys now to discuss.

794
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,632
- Yeah, I think it really
comes down to character.

795
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,735
His character really showed
throughout the season.

796
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,937
You know, calling someone
"rough around the edges,"

797
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,740
calling the girls "bitches,"
it's just one of those things

798
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,676
that is something that,
you know, I would want

799
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:19,378
to address in front
of a live audience

800
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,712
and in front of the guys.

801
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,280
But for him not to be here,

802
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,949
I think it speaks a lot
to his character

803
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,518
and how cowardly he is
not to be here.

804
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,253
- For a man to have to put down
a woman

805
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,324
to feel like he's empowered
is just not okay.

806
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,991
And if this is how
you're treating Gabby,

807
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,494
you don't deserve Rachel either.

808
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,263
So I'm glad that they
eventually got rid of him.

809
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,469
- He completely lied
about the whole thing.

810
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:47,839
After hearing all of that,
he's a misogynist,

811
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,443
and, honestly, his dog, Rambo,
doesn't need training.

812
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,677
He needs training.

813
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,382
- It was rude what he said,
it was disrespectful,

814
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,217
and to not only put
Rachel through that,

815
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,453
put Gabby through that,
put us through that,

816
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,723
he's putting his dog through,
like, a lot more trauma.

817
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,491
Like, taking away the dog toy.

818
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,427
I'm like,
"Bro, like, free Rambo."

819
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:12,063
Like, what are you doing?
Like, let him out.

820
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,066
- I mean, I guess Hayden
and I like different girls.

821
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,111
I guess I like girls that
are rough around the edges.

822
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,737
I love Gabby. She's...

823
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:22,140
- Whee-yoo!

824
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,584
- All right, there is one man
who did decide

825
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,577
to show up tonight,
and that's Logan.

826
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:28,313
Obviously, Logan,
he accepted Rachel's rose,

827
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,682
he later on switched
to Team Gabby,

828
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:31,893
and I wanted to open it up
to you guys.

829
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,519
Ethan, what were
the repercussions of that?

830
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:38,056
- Unfortunately, the group date
in Belgium was cancelled.

831
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,624
It did rub me the wrong way.

832
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,927
And getting that
group date cancelled

833
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:43,962
was tough on me
'cause that was time

834
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:45,297
that I could've used bad.

835
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,799
- Logan switching,
we instantly knew that,

836
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,568
"Okay, now there's another guy,

837
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,937
our conversations with Gabby
are gonna be shorter now."

838
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:54,306
I didn't have a ton of time
with Gabby at that point,

839
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:57,108
so I really could've used
those extra minutes,

840
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,744
those extra conversations

841
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,380
to strengthen my relationship
with her before Hometowns.

842
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,249
- I saw two wonderful people,

843
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,419
and although I felt more moved
by one connection,

844
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,654
I thought maybe there's
potential in the other one

845
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,256
that I hadn't seen or explored.

846
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,824
- At what point did you know?

847
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,836
- Felt like you were just
looking for the next step.

848
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,294
That's why you accepted
that rose.

849
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,663
You went to France,
and you sent me home.

850
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,174
- I wasn't just looking
for the next step,

851
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,333
because you know what?

852
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,636
I saw this moving connection
with Gabby.

853
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,404
And so I accepted her rose.

854
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,507
And, you know,
if that's seen as a bitch move,

855
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:29,641
you know, so be it.

856
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,109
But I thought
it was worth exploring

857
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,296
if it means spending the rest
of my life with someone.

858
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,150
- Logan, look, I can tell
that you have a lot

859
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,228
you want to get off your chest.

860
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:41,462
Want to come up in the hot seat?

861
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,046
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Let's have a talk.

862
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,763
- All right, listen, first off,

863
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,331
I really respect you
for being here.

864
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,133
Tell me if I get this right.

865
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,269
You flirted
with both Gabby and Rachel,

866
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,204
you made out with both
Gabby and Rachel,

867
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:02,941
and then you joined Team Rachel
until you didn't.

868
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:05,210
Basically about right?

869
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,612
- In layman's terms,
that's sort of right.

870
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,214
That's a lot to process.

871
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:11,683
- You know, it's...
I was constantly

872
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,952
battling two things, Jesse.

873
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:17,956
It was me not wanting to make
these women's journey,

874
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,458
which was already so difficult,
more difficult

875
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,995
versus me telling my truth
and following my heart.

876
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,431
And those two things,
unfortunately,

877
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:28,233
got to a place
where they conflicted.

878
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,535
- Let's go back to that
decisive Rose Ceremony

879
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:33,438
where you knew that if you
accepted a rose from Rachel,

880
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,216
that meant you were gonna
have to commit to her.

881
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,677
- Looking back,
after Rachel gave me the rose,

882
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,179
I would've liked to have
pulled them both aside

883
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,481
and say, "I am very open

884
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:44,883
"to exploring things
with Rachel,

885
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,217
"but I have to be honest,

886
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,820
the connection that moved me
was with Gabby."

887
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,064
- Well, that leads me
to my question.

888
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,023
So before those roses
were handed out,

889
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,125
were you hoping
for Gabby's rose?

890
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,360
Or were you hoping for...

891
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,038
Like, what were you hoping
in that moment?

892
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:59,598
- I was having a heart attack.
I couldn't believe...

893
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:02,000
- So was... yeah.
- That this was happening.

894
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:04,035
- So was everybody.
- So soon after and without me

895
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,971
being able to talk
to them beforehand.

896
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,573
- Honestly, I just don't really
have, like, the sympathy card

897
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,917
that I guess you're wanting
right now,

898
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,543
for me at least, because you...

899
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,478
- I'm not asking
for anything from you.

900
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:14,746
- I think in your mind,

901
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,615
you felt like Rachel
really wasn't into you,

902
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,217
so your next thing was,
"If I flip,

903
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,585
I can stay longer."

904
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,320
And that's what you did.

905
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:23,989
- I disagree completely, Jordan.

906
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,625
There was a huge part of me
that thought

907
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:30,595
when I stepped away from Rachel
and told Gabby how I felt,

908
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:31,863
that she would send me home.

909
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,431
So it wasn't the easy choice.

910
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:36,368
It wasn't jumping over
because it was convenient,

911
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,370
'cause it was anything
but convenient.

912
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:41,740
- But Logan, I hope you do know
you did mislead Rachel

913
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,375
throughout the whole process.

914
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,609
- It was unintentional.

915
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:47,646
A conversation that I was
desperate to have,

916
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,882
which would keep people
from being misled,

917
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:53,184
I wanted the right time
and place, and it didn't come.

918
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:55,987
And I wish I would've
just had the conversation

919
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:56,988
right off the bat.

920
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:58,456
- Bottom line now, Logan,

921
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:01,126
when you look back on all this,
do you regret

922
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:04,396
leaving Rachel to pursue Gabby?

923
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,465
- I wish I had done it
in a more graceful way

924
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:08,852
that didn't affect
so many people,

925
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,670
but I don't regret
pursuing Gabby, no.

926
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,247
- You know, Rachel and Gabby
are gonna be here later.

927
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:14,305
- Yeah.

928
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,974
- What do you want
to say to them?

929
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:20,045
- I'm sorry for making things

930
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,480
even more hard
than they needed to be.

931
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,748
But I hope they can just see

932
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,417
that my heart was
in the right place.

933
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,894
- I know it was
really tough for you.

934
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,520
And, listen... I mean this...

935
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,822
Thank you for coming here
tonight

936
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,590
and facing
all of these tough questions.

937
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,560
Yeah.

938
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:37,362
- Thank you so much, Logan.
- Thank you.

939
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,006
- And if you think you've seen
the last of Logan,

940
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,166
by the way, you haven't.

941
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,843
You're gonna see him again
when a new season

942
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,504
of "Bachelor in Paradise"
premiers on September 27th.

943
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:53,411
All right, well,
before we go any further,

944
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:56,815
I don't know about you all,
but I could sure use a drink.

945
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,084
Fellas, what do you think?

946
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,388
I'm craving a little champagne.

947
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:05,724
- Ooh.
- Nice.

948
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,559
- And thankfully
I got some good news

949
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,228
because our incredible friends
at Virgin Voyages

950
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:12,997
have just the app for that.

951
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,667
This app works on all
Virgin Voyages sailings,

952
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,812
but in honor of this season
cruising around the globe,

953
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,571
they're letting us have some fun

954
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,639
right here
on the "Men Tell All" stage.

955
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:26,711
Get this, all you gotta do
is just shake your phone,

956
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:27,846
and then you have to press

957
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,882
the all-important Push Me button

958
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:33,418
like that.

959
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:35,887
And voilà, champagne.

960
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,159
- I gotta be honest, I was
definitely using this app

961
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:42,527
while on board the ship.

962
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,028
Thank you so much.

963
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,363
How great is this, everybody?

964
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,898
Champagne on demand.

965
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,399
It doesn't get any better.

966
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,769
Now, before we do
a toast to this season,

967
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,438
I do have some news.

968
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:56,875
And, in fact, for all of
those of you in this audience,

969
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,513
this news is about to change
your lives, forever.

970
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,084
- Well, get ready.

971
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:08,953
Because our amazing friends
at Virgin Voyages

972
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,658
are giving every single person
in this audience...

973
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,128
A free cruise!

974
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,300
Yes!

975
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,569
You get a cruise!
You get a cruise!

976
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,739
You get a cruise!
You get a cruise!

977
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:31,943
Everybody gets a cruise!

978
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,212
Yes, that is right!

979
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:36,214
Each of you will be given
the chance

980
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:40,718
to shake for champagne
on your very own free cruise

981
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:44,222
from Virgin Voyages!

982
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,357
And, yes, you're also
gonna be able to pick

983
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:50,662
from any one of their amazing
adults-only sailing experiences

984
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,163
all around the world.

985
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,165
Audience, how are we feeling
about that?

986
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,370
And if you at home,
or anyone in our audience,

987
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:02,473
you want to learn more,
you can go to virginvoyages.com

988
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,342
for more information.

989
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:06,511
I think that calls for a toast.

990
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:10,348
So let's all raise our glasses
and toast to new adventures!

991
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:12,250
Cheers, everyone!

992
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,560
- Welcome back
to the "Men Tell All."

993
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:25,163
Now, this next man stole
America's heart

994
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,398
with his good looks,
his casual charm,

995
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,801
and with his tireless defense
of the two women

996
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,502
and their right
to call the shots.

997
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:34,505
But it was his heart-wrenching
breakup with Gabby

998
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,108
that really made him
a Bachelor Nation favorite.

999
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:38,476
Nate, you want to come on up?

1000
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:50,455
Have a seat.

1001
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:54,926
All right, Nate, I think
I speak on behalf of everybody

1002
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:58,963
when I say that your
vulnerability, your maturity,

1003
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,332
it really was
impressive to watch.

1004
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:05,755
Obviously, we're gonna have
a lot to get to.

1005
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:07,181
I'm gonna ask you a lot.
I want to hear

1006
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:08,606
all about your time with Gabby.

1007
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:09,984
Of course,
we also have to address

1008
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:12,277
everything that's being said
on social media too,

1009
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,645
and we'll get to that,

1010
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,089
but first, let's take a look
back at your journey.

1011
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:16,514
- All right.

1012
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:25,757
- Oh, my God, my first kiss
with Gabby, it was magical.

1013
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,125
Like, her lips are so soft.

1014
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,693
Oh, my God.

1015
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,663
- I knew she was a good kisser,
but damn.

1016
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,298
- How old are you?
- I'm 33.

1017
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:36,401
I've never met a mature man.

1018
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:37,835
- Her smile is so radiant

1019
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,571
and her personality just
makes it shine even more.

1020
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:44,242
There's so many levels to her
that it's just beautiful.

1021
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,711
She just has a way
of bringing out the best in me

1022
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,514
and I just like
who I am around her.

1023
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,950
Your smile melts my heart.

1024
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,618
- Aww.
- It really does.

1025
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:55,420
The second I laid eyes on you,

1026
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,588
I felt like I was
meeting my best friend

1027
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,158
and forever could never
be long enough

1028
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,227
to just realize how beautiful
you are inside and out.

1029
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,797
- Aww, thank you.

1030
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:08,967
Nate makes me feel special

1031
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,902
in a way
that nobody else has here,

1032
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,037
and I was wondering
throughout this whole time,

1033
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:16,474
how did you become
so emotionally intelligent,

1034
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:19,944
because it's just not common
for men.

1035
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:23,281
- I have a beautiful baby girl
who is six,

1036
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,249
and she is my world.

1037
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,252
Like, a pocket of my heart
just bursted open

1038
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,822
the first time, you know,
she said Dad or the first time

1039
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,991
she told me she loved me,
the first time,

1040
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,826
like, I felt her hug me.

1041
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,495
Like, I'm a girl dad 1,000%.

1042
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:39,964
- You're gonna make me cry.
So sweet.

1043
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,833
- Oh, thank you.
Please don't make me cry.

1044
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,101
Oh, my gosh.

1045
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,602
- I've never met anyone

1046
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,838
or dated anyone like him before.

1047
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:50,141
It's so heartwarming to know
that men like him exist.

1048
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:53,111
Because he really is,
like, a true, true man.

1049
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,482
- Gabby's just so unique
and I just see

1050
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,884
so much in her
whenever I look at her.

1051
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:02,787
Every day that I spend
a second more with her,

1052
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,323
I see my potential wife in Gabby

1053
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,959
and I feel like
this is meant to be.

1054
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,230
Oh, God, I don't even know
where to start.

1055
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:16,200
I have, like,
such deep feelings for you.

1056
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:20,805
And I never want to say goodbye.

1057
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,741
But I think

1058
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:25,910
I'm, like, terrified

1059
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:30,081
of not just, like, being a mom,

1060
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:32,817
but being, like, bad at it.

1061
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,830
- I'm gonna miss you a lot.

1062
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,501
- I don't know.

1063
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,371
I don't know
if I made a mistake.

1064
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:02,413
Just seems unfair
that it's someone

1065
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,817
who I was maybe
falling in love with.

1066
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,765
- You know,
I've never communicated

1067
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,524
with someone so easily.

1068
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,061
You know, I just felt a warmth
of just being around her,

1069
00:43:17,128 --> 00:43:19,097
being able to laugh and talk.

1070
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,832
It's is gonna be
a heart connection

1071
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,667
that I don't think I'll be able
to replicate.

1072
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:30,074
You can't just switch off
emotions and feelings.

1073
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:32,677
I'm still, you know,
falling for her,

1074
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:36,848
but it's just sad
that it's over.

1075
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:50,504
- What's making you so emotional

1076
00:43:50,528 --> 00:43:52,430
watching that back?

1077
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:57,368
- Just to see
how beautiful our journey was,

1078
00:43:57,435 --> 00:44:00,004
it just brought up
so many raw emotions.

1079
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:03,741
Even though we broke up,
it was still a beautiful moment

1080
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,152
that I got to share
in time with her,

1081
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:08,346
so it was special
to see that again.

1082
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:11,449
- In that moment,
how did it feel for you

1083
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:15,019
knowing that you were
saying goodbye to Gabby?

1084
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:18,289
- It was one of
the toughest goodbyes ever.

1085
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:20,124
You know, when I woke up
that morning,

1086
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:22,536
you know, I wasn't expecting to
see my name on the date card.

1087
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,029
And to go
from just, like, a high

1088
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:26,497
and not know
that she was feeling

1089
00:44:26,564 --> 00:44:29,033
those, like, feelings of doubt,

1090
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,344
like, I just wanted to be there
for her

1091
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:31,645
and let her know
that it was okay

1092
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,738
'cause I know that she was
choosing with her heart.

1093
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,439
And I can never be mad
at her for that.

1094
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,643
- Yeah, it was heartbreaking
to hear when she talked about

1095
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,579
how fearful she was
of being a mom,

1096
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:45,216
and she was really fearful
of being a bad mom.

1097
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:49,453
- It's so hard to hear her say
those things because for me,

1098
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,090
to see so much in her,
being a nurturer,

1099
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,027
someone that's so compassionate
and thoughtful,

1100
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,995
she just had
so many facets to her

1101
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,164
that would make her
the best mom.

1102
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:04,468
But I empathize with her
and I do not feel the need,

1103
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,571
you know...

1104
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,778
Like, there's no hard feelings
between us.

1105
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,581
- When you finally told Gabby
about your beautiful daughter,

1106
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:20,384
Mila, your face just lights up
whenever you talk about her.

1107
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,086
How precious is that for you?

1108
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:24,655
- Having Mila in my life
is literally

1109
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,257
the greatest treasure
that I have.

1110
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:27,491
It really is.

1111
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,293
She really is my heart.

1112
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:33,164
To be loved
by that little girl is...

1113
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,733
it's the rawest form of love
that I've ever felt,

1114
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,468
and that's why
I'm so passionate about her

1115
00:45:37,535 --> 00:45:41,906
and I want my partner to have
that same level of support.

1116
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:43,207
- If she's watching tonight,

1117
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:46,344
what would you want to say
to her?

1118
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,846
- Everything that I do
is for you.

1119
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,748
Baby girl, you saved me.

1120
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:51,983
You did.

1121
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,618
I'm a better man because of you

1122
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,921
and I'm gonna try to be
the best man because of you.

1123
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:58,532
- That's really beautiful.
Thanks for sharing that.

1124
00:45:58,556 --> 00:45:59,556
Thank you.

1125
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:12,203
Before we move on,
recently now, on social media,

1126
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:15,006
there have been
some rumors circulating

1127
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:16,774
surrounding some
of your past relationships

1128
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:18,476
and there have been
some allegations

1129
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,078
that you kept your daughter
a secret

1130
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,714
from someone you were dating
for a year and a half.

1131
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:32,056
- I went through
a pretty traumatizing time

1132
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:35,092
when I went through divorce,

1133
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:37,862
and essentially the foundation

1134
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,764
that was built
around my daughter

1135
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:44,035
was... pretty much crumbled.

1136
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:47,238
And the one thing

1137
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,674
that I protect
most on this earth

1138
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,208
is my daughter.

1139
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:52,677
Like, I would never bring her

1140
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,679
into a situation
I feel is dangerous,

1141
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:57,648
a situation that I feel
is unstable.

1142
00:46:57,715 --> 00:46:59,784
And so it just made me
put a wall up,

1143
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,352
protecting my daughter

1144
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:04,221
from the instability
of my dating life.

1145
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:06,657
- And for clarity too,
we're also talking about

1146
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:11,495
the fact that you were dating
two women simultaneously.

1147
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:14,832
- I would say I'm deeply sorry

1148
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:18,235
for the way that I acted.

1149
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:20,304
I should've been
more communicative,

1150
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:23,441
I should've been more clear
in my intentions,

1151
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:27,878
and I pray that you forgive
the man that I was

1152
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:30,181
because I'm not
that same person.

1153
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:33,184
- There are people that are
now starting to second-guess

1154
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,419
everything you said to Gabby

1155
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:38,556
and maybe even
your feelings for her.

1156
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:42,860
- Every moment and emotion
that I had with Gabby was real.

1157
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:45,930
We both felt it.
We experienced it.

1158
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,465
You know, in past relationships,

1159
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,667
I can't always say that we had
the commitment of,

1160
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:51,545
"We'll be boyfriend
and girlfriend," but with this,

1161
00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:54,105
I committed to Gabby
as her boyfriend.

1162
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,207
And I walked into it
with that lens.

1163
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,909
- Jesse, I have one thing
to say to Nate real quick.

1164
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,177
I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

1165
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:04,115
- I think truly great men
make other men better,

1166
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,650
and Nate, you made me better
just talking to you,

1167
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,052
being around you.

1168
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:09,587
You're my bro. All right?

1169
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,022
So I got your back.

1170
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:13,424
- That's really well said, Alec.

1171
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:15,025
Look, I know it's not easy
to come here

1172
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:16,370
facing these
difficult questions.

1173
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,295
I also know
how important it is for you

1174
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,398
to make little Mila so proud.

1175
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:21,942
And I think you did that
here tonight.

1176
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:23,401
So thank you for coming, Nate.

1177
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:28,038
All right,
make sure you stick around.

1178
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:29,840
We got so much more
from "Men Tell All"

1179
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,375
when we come back.

1180
00:48:41,552 --> 00:48:43,421
- Welcome back
to "Men Tell All."

1181
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,623
Rachel and Gabby are
standing by backstage

1182
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:49,293
waiting to join us, and I hear
that they have a lot to say

1183
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,528
to their men here.

1184
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,797
But before that,
we're gonna take a quick trip

1185
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:55,499
south of the border to check in
with a few of the stars

1186
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:58,335
from the upcoming season
of "Bachelor in Paradise."

1187
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:01,172
Please give it up
for Serene, Genevieve,

1188
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,207
Victoria, and Andrew.

1189
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,675
It's so great seeing all of you.

1190
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:06,177
Thanks so much for being here.

1191
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,524
So, Andrew, I gotta ask you,
without giving too much away,

1192
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,648
what can Bachelor Nation
expect from "Paradise"

1193
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,516
this summer down on the beach?

1194
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:16,187
- Not to even be cliché
or use buzz words,

1195
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:19,523
but it is definitely
the most dramatic season.

1196
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,993
I swear I'm not even kidding.

1197
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,361
It's... you're gonna be

1198
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:25,772
on the edge of your seat
the whole time.

1199
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,231
- It was humid,
there were crabs,

1200
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,632
and a lot of man tears.

1201
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,734
One or two.

1202
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,937
You don't have to answer
that one.

1203
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:34,080
And, Victoria, look, I know

1204
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,482
a lot of people are
really surprised.

1205
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:37,141
They're also really excited
to see you

1206
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,476
heading on down to the beach.

1207
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:39,982
What made you want to go
take a trip?

1208
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,146
- Yeah, no one's more surprised
to be there than me.

1209
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,583
I feel like, you know, I'm 28

1210
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:50,187
and it hasn't worked out for me
thus far, so here I am.

1211
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:51,188
- Giving it another shot.

1212
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:52,723
Now, Serene, of course you know

1213
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:54,158
a lot of people
in Bachelor Nation,

1214
00:49:54,225 --> 00:49:56,494
they love to try to predict
who's gonna be hooking up,

1215
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,829
maybe getting engaged,
but how surprised

1216
00:49:58,896 --> 00:50:00,536
are people gonna be
at some of the couples

1217
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:01,866
they see down on the beach?

1218
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:04,168
- You know, I've never been
to Paradise before,

1219
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:07,471
but it wasn't anything
that I expected,

1220
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:10,241
and so honestly
I think it's gonna be

1221
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:11,575
a crazy ride every week.

1222
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:13,410
- Yeah.
- I feel like so much happened

1223
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:17,615
that it's easy to forget
just how crazy it actually was.

1224
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,092
You want to take a look back?
- Oh, no. Don't do it, Jess.

1225
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:20,861
Don't do it to us.
- What do you think, everybody?

1226
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:22,829
You ready for your first look
at some of the romance

1227
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,688
and drama that unfolded
this summer?

1228
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:28,459
I think it's that time,
Bachelor Nation.

1229
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,127
Let's roll it.

1230
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,002
- This season
on "Bachelor in Paradise"...

1231
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:43,073
- Brittany grabbed my.
- Kira played with my nipples.

1232
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:46,219
- I can't say
I've gotten a girl this wet.

1233
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:47,344
This is new.

1234
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:49,346
- Ooh.
How was that?

1235
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:50,548
- What is it?

1236
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,783
- Salley's vibrator.
- Ew!

1237
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,519
Oh, my God!

1238
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:56,954
- Whoo!
- Turn it off!

1239
00:50:57,021 --> 00:50:58,322
- Oh, my God.

1240
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:00,991
- Welcome to the finest show
on television.

1241
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:04,361
- Jeez.

1242
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:06,931
- Whoo!

1243
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,633
- At a time
when we all need it the most.

1244
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,870
- Ahh!
- Oh, my God.

1245
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:15,239
- I told myself I wouldn't
have sex on the first night...

1246
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:17,308
- We're not having sex, Tarzan.

1247
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:18,542
- Ahh!

1248
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:20,511
Am I choking you?

1249
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,913
- It's America's sexiest singles

1250
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,416
all on the same beach
dating each other.

1251
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,418
- It is very hard
to juggle two men at once.

1252
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:28,604
I've never done that before.

1253
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,888
- Logan is a man of high demand.

1254
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:33,857
- It's getting messy
on this beach, bro.

1255
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:37,127
- So what could
possibly go wrong?

1256
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,996
I want to go home.

1257
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:40,197
I'm done.

1258
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:42,199
- Dude, I just saw them kiss.

1259
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:45,269
- I can't juggle,
like, two relationships.

1260
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:47,071
- I feel so betrayed right now.

1261
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:49,273
- Why is it so hard
to find love?

1262
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,774
I don't get it.

1263
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,776
- I'm so sorry.
- I want to leave!

1264
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,945
- Bye.
Everybody wasted my time.

1265
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:56,780
I'm not even gonna talk to you.

1266
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,515
- You want to go
toe-to-toe with me?

1267
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,851
See what happens, bitch.
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1268
00:52:00,918 --> 00:52:02,462
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1269
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:04,421
Medic, medic, medic!

1270
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,692
- And a shocking twist
divides the beach.

1271
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:10,260
Ladies, go pack your bags.

1272
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:12,262
You'll be leaving Paradise
immediately.

1273
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,632
- Are you kidding me?
This is insane.

1274
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:16,867
- It's just stupid.
I'm just mad.

1275
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:19,303
- I'm sick of being poked
like a bear every day.

1276
00:52:21,105 --> 00:52:24,308
You, Jesse Palmer!

1277
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:28,879
- But for some couples,
everything goes right.

1278
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:30,714
- I haven't felt
this shooken up in a while.

1279
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:32,483
- I felt numb

1280
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:34,685
and you're bringing me
back to life.

1281
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:36,120
- Oh, my God.

1282
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:37,664
- I'm in love with him.
Like, not gonna lie.

1283
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:40,090
- I just love you. I love you.

1284
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:46,497
- Just when you think
you've seen it all...

1285
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:47,883
- It's Paradise's
first threesome.

1286
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:49,199
- It's the most shocking...

1287
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:50,910
This bitch is out her mind.

1288
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,403
- Sexy...
- You're so hot.

1289
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,637
- You're hot.
- You're hot.

1290
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:55,005
- You're hot.
- Mwah.

1291
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:57,508
- And funniest season
in Bachelor history.

1292
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:59,309
- You look great,
you look great.

1293
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:01,278
- Who will find love?

1294
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,747
- I look at you and I see
the future mother of my kids.

1295
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:05,416
- Who will leave brokenhearted?

1296
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:08,152
- Why do we need to make this
a thing when it's not?

1297
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:09,953
- Who will get engaged?

1298
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,190
- I love you.
- Oh, my God.

1299
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:16,493
- Find out starting Tuesday,
September 27th,

1300
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,930
on the season premiere
of "Bachelor in Paradise."

1301
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:23,400
- Oh, wow.

1302
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:25,169
- You see,
I told you it was crazy.

1303
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:26,904
By the way, "you, Jesse Palmer"?

1304
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,305
- Yes, Jesse!
- Jesse.

1305
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:32,042
- I knew I was gonna get
a shout-out, but not like that!

1306
00:53:32,109 --> 00:53:33,944
Crazy things happen
down in Paradise.

1307
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:35,121
Don't give anything
too much away.

1308
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,389
- I'm still mad.
- Don't give it away.

1309
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,924
All right, Serene, Genevieve,
Victoria, Andrew,

1310
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,159
thank you all so much
for being here.

1311
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:40,551
It's gonna be so much fun
to watch.

1312
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:42,586
Cannot wait to see it all unfold

1313
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:44,297
when the next season
of "Bachelor in Paradise"

1314
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,156
premieres on September 27th.

1315
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,225
And when we come back,
Gabby and Rachel

1316
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:51,829
finally join us on stage
to face their ex-boyfriends.

1317
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:56,066
Is that gonna be awkward?
Probably.

1318
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:03,807
- Welcome back
to "Men Tell All."

1319
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:05,609
Now, look, it's been
a dramatic night

1320
00:54:05,676 --> 00:54:07,511
and I feel like
it's about to get

1321
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:11,682
a whole lot more dramatic,
times two.

1322
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,183
Is everybody finally ready?

1323
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,655
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

1324
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:21,058
our dynamic duo,
your Bachelorettes,

1325
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:22,259
Gabby and Rachel!

1326
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:33,737
- So good to see you.
How are you?

1327
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:35,806
So good to see you too.
How are you?

1328
00:54:35,873 --> 00:54:38,142
- Jesse!
- Good to see you.

1329
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,576
Have a seat.

1330
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,914
Oh, it's so great
seeing you both.

1331
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:45,783
- Thank you.
- You too.

1332
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:47,961
- So happy you both are here.
How does it feel to be back?

1333
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:49,953
How does it feel
to see all the guys?

1334
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,421
- It's like we never left.

1335
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,457
- Roby. The blond hair.

1336
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:55,159
I love it.
- Oh, my God.

1337
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:57,060
- Would you have kept me
with blond hair?

1338
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,529
Yes.

1339
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,531
No, just kidding!
- Wow.

1340
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,399
- I wasn't sure
if it was a magic trick or not

1341
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:05,435
that he had kind of pulled
before, like, showing up here.

1342
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,137
Well, of course
it is so great, too,

1343
00:55:07,204 --> 00:55:09,673
because the last time that
we were all here on this stage

1344
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,217
was when you both found out
that you were

1345
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,677
gonna be doing
this whole thing together.

1346
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:15,445
How great has it been
for both of you

1347
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:17,390
to have each other for support
throughout all this?

1348
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,216
- We always say
we wouldn't have it

1349
00:55:19,283 --> 00:55:20,784
any other way, which is true.

1350
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:22,853
I think the support
that we've given each other

1351
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,655
is something that people
in our position

1352
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,557
haven't been able
to receive before.

1353
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,392
And we leaned
on each other so much

1354
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,228
and it made our experience
that much better.

1355
00:55:31,295 --> 00:55:32,996
- Yeah, we've had

1356
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:34,898
highs and lows,
and throughout it all,

1357
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:37,968
having her here has just been
the ultimate thing.

1358
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:40,270
- Yeah, it really has been
uncharted territory.

1359
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,039
Two Bachelorettes,
on your own journeys,

1360
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:43,505
you're dating
the same group of men.

1361
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,142
Gabby, what was
the hardest thing

1362
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:46,719
to have to navigate
at the beginning of all this,

1363
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:48,045
do you think?

1364
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,514
- Surprisingly, I felt like

1365
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:54,518
the men kind of showed us

1366
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:55,745
that it was hard to navigate.

1367
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:57,354
I mean, we didn't know
what to expect.

1368
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:59,990
I feel like Rachel's and I
communication was so good

1369
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:02,759
throughout the whole thing,
but the most unpredictable part

1370
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:05,295
was how the men would react
to two of us.

1371
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,140
Which is understandable.
It's never been done before.

1372
00:56:07,164 --> 00:56:08,164
- Yeah, of course.

1373
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,509
Anything you think
you two would've

1374
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,201
done differently
when it comes to dating

1375
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:12,302
the same group of guys?

1376
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,271
- I mean, of course
we made mistakes.

1377
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:15,572
We're only human.

1378
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:17,975
But ultimately we were
just following our hearts

1379
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,510
and really doing
the best we can.

1380
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:21,821
- I think you forged
your own paths.

1381
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:23,847
I think you guys have done
an outstanding job

1382
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:25,074
together throughout all this.

1383
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:30,654
I want to ask you both
about First Impression Roses.

1384
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:33,257
Of course, Rachel,
you gave yours to Tino.

1385
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,759
You gave your First Impression
Rose, Gabby, to Mario.

1386
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:37,895
And I think for people
watching that back,

1387
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:41,031
it just never seemed like you
and Mario were able to capture

1388
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:42,575
the magic that you had
on that first night together.

1389
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:43,834
What do you think happened?

1390
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:47,104
- Yeah, I think a lot of it
was the navigation

1391
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,906
of having two Bachelorettes.

1392
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,475
I had thought
after our first conversation

1393
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,677
that he wanted
to get to know Rachel,

1394
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:55,412
which I obviously
understand why,

1395
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:57,414
but there was a lack
of the communication there.

1396
00:56:57,481 --> 00:56:59,716
I didn't know
what side he was on

1397
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,885
and things progressed so fast

1398
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:04,063
and I think the men started
popping up left and right.

1399
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,589
"I'm here for you.
I'm here for you."

1400
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:09,927
Whereas I didn't quite know,
Mario, where you were standing.

1401
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:11,828
You can see
in our last conversation,

1402
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:14,698
you were like "I'm all in
on you," which I appreciate,

1403
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:17,267
but it did seem a little late

1404
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:19,069
compared to some
of the other men.

1405
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:21,538
- I think that we had a great
first night, like you said.

1406
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:22,539
We had a great connection.

1407
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,708
And the following Rose Ceremony

1408
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:27,444
where I did have
a conversation with Rachel,

1409
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:28,855
it was just to have
a conversation.

1410
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:30,714
I think, you know,
that third Rose Ceremony

1411
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,482
where we chose sides,
I was with Gabby

1412
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,117
and I didn't pivot, right?

1413
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:37,087
And we did see that this season
with a few guys that did pivot,

1414
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:40,691
and, you know, one being Logan
where he was accepted

1415
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:42,659
and I was sent home
because of that.

1416
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:46,096
And so, for me,
I just felt like, you know...

1417
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:49,866
I just felt kind of like
you did me wrong.

1418
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:52,169
- I'm sorry you think
that I did you wrong

1419
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:54,304
because I think I also feel
the same way

1420
00:57:54,371 --> 00:57:56,406
and that there was never
a conversation

1421
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,941
leading up to that point,

1422
00:57:58,008 --> 00:58:00,944
until almost it was too late,
that you were here for me.

1423
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:03,280
Because to me, it felt like
you were still entertaining

1424
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:05,882
both sides until I made
that decision for you,

1425
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:08,585
but I also want to be chosen.

1426
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,287
- Yeah.

1427
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:13,469
- Okay, Rachel,
I want to ask you

1428
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,201
about your first one-on-one
date with Jordan V.

1429
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,094
That really was...
- Hi, Jordan.

1430
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,429
- An out of this world date.

1431
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,630
It really was.

1432
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:22,733
It just seemed like
it was going to so well.

1433
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:23,967
- Yeah.
- And then of course

1434
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,168
you sent him home that night.

1435
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,703
What do you want to say to him?

1436
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,939
- I feel like
from the beginning,

1437
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:33,043
we definitely had a connection,
but I think ultimately

1438
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:35,110
throughout this whole journey,
my biggest fear was,

1439
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:37,214
I never wanted anyone
to feel like

1440
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,850
they were being strung along.

1441
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:42,919
And so it was
such a hard decision.

1442
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:44,921
But I just really was
following my heart

1443
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:47,691
at the end of the day,
and I really am sorry.

1444
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:50,394
- No, I mean, obviously,
it's great to see you again.

1445
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,938
And you look
absolutely stunning tonight.

1446
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:53,597
I love that dress.
It's fantastic.

1447
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:55,265
- Aww.

1448
00:58:55,332 --> 00:58:56,600
- But, you know, like, I...

1449
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,335
I just... I appreciate you
so much,

1450
00:58:58,402 --> 00:59:00,137
and honestly, like,
we had a great...

1451
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,514
We had a great connection.
We had a great date.

1452
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,140
Like, honestly
that zero gravity,

1453
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,741
something I'll remember forever.

1454
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,252
And so I'm just glad
I got this opportunity

1455
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:07,286
to be part of your journey.

1456
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:08,612
- Yeah, thank you, and I think

1457
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:11,681
Jordan V. is gonna have
no problems going forward.

1458
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:16,153
- Gabby, I know
the first couple weeks

1459
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,321
of this whole thing for you
was very difficult.

1460
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,723
It was very emotional,

1461
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,192
and in part because
of some of the horrible things

1462
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:25,162
that Hayden and Jacob had said
about you, or said to you.

1463
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,997
Jacob's obviously here tonight.

1464
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,066
What would you like
to address with him?

1465
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:31,234
- What would you like
to address with me, Jacob?

1466
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:36,139
- It was extremely hurtful
what I had said, obviously.

1467
00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:39,276
And it took me watching it back
and to see that moment.

1468
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:42,813
I mean, I still have
so much emotion towards it.

1469
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:44,514
You mentioned it yourself.

1470
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,584
I just didn't have
self-awareness.

1471
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:49,886
I'm realizing that now
and I'm trying

1472
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:52,389
to learn and better myself.

1473
00:59:52,456 --> 00:59:54,157
Just know that...

1474
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,329
Just know I'm sorry
for my actions,

1475
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:02,466
and I know you may not
accept this apology,

1476
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,668
but I am truly and deeply sorry.

1477
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:06,670
- Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.

1478
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:07,838
- Thank you.

1479
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,676
- Obviously,
I know that this was

1480
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:15,412
an incredibly emotional journey
and experience for both of you,

1481
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:17,848
and I know that there were
different times in all this

1482
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:20,150
when you questioned whether
or not you were deserving

1483
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:21,284
of being the Bachelorette.

1484
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,386
What do you think it was
that made this

1485
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,822
so much more difficult
than what you even expected?

1486
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:29,693
- I think it's definitely
a crazy position

1487
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:32,896
that no one can ever
foresee how to navigate,

1488
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,297
if you've never been in it.

1489
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:36,733
And you deal
with so much self-doubt,

1490
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,235
especially when
you're finding love.

1491
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,770
And I think everyone can
really relate to that.

1492
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:42,772
But having Gabby
at the end of the day

1493
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:45,275
and always having
a major support

1494
01:00:45,342 --> 01:00:46,643
is the reason
that we were really

1495
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,411
- able to make it through it.
- Yeah.

1496
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,947
- After having gone through it,
I love you.

1497
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:52,549
Aww.

1498
01:00:52,616 --> 01:00:55,619
- I can't...
I don't think that anyone else

1499
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:56,820
didn't feel this way.

1500
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:59,156
I think by having
Rachel and I as support,

1501
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:02,025
we were able to vocalize it
for the first time.

1502
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:04,427
It is a lot of pressure
to date this many men.

1503
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,863
We've all been in relationships
where we doubt ourself,

1504
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:09,399
and now we're in ten times
those relationships

1505
01:01:09,466 --> 01:01:10,934
and ten times the doubt.
- Right.

1506
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:12,478
- I don't think
it's anything personal.

1507
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,638
I think we're just
open and transparent

1508
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,773
about how hard the role is.
- Yeah.

1509
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,885
It's really, really hard
to overcome, no doubt about it.

1510
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:20,977
I think it's so great
that you both had

1511
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,013
each other for support
throughout all this.

1512
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:24,919
I mean, America is just
loving your friendship.

1513
01:01:24,948 --> 01:01:26,028
It really has been special.

1514
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:30,930
- The real love story.
We just headbutted.

1515
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:32,522
- This is the real love story.

1516
01:01:32,589 --> 01:01:34,191
- All right,
we are just getting started

1517
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:35,659
with Gabby and Rachel.

1518
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:37,925

01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:56,713
They're coming up next.

1529
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,860
Make sure you stick around.

1530
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,363
- Welcome back
to the "Men Tell All."

1531
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,794
Gabby and Rachel have just been
reunited with their men

1532
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,862
from their season,
and we're having

1533
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:13,964
some tough conversations.

1534
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,365
I do want to continue,
and Rachel,

1535
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:17,133
I want to ask you about Logan.

1536
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,969
Infamously, of course,
everybody remembers

1537
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:21,137
he accepted your rose
at that Rose Ceremony

1538
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:24,407
only to then change his mind
on the ship

1539
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,610
and decide to pursue Gabby.

1540
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,678
What would you
like to say to him?

1541
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:32,148
- I was obviously hurt because
I did keep my heart open.

1542
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,175
I just wish you were
a little more honest earlier,

1543
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,219
but I understand.

1544
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:38,054
- That's totally fair.

1545
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:40,257
You know,
there's times that I could've

1546
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:41,491
done things differently,

1547
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:44,094
and I think I was looking
for the perfect time

1548
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,296
to have a conversation
where it was private

1549
01:02:46,363 --> 01:02:48,465
and where I could say
everything I wanted to say

1550
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:50,276
and where it was the right
place and the right time,

1551
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,969
but I wish I didn't wait
for the perfect time

1552
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:54,504
and the perfect place, you know,

1553
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:56,640
and that's a lesson
I'll take home.

1554
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:58,284
And you know, I'm still
learning and growing,

1555
01:02:58,308 --> 01:03:00,210
so I appreciate
the both of you for giving me

1556
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:01,811
an opportunity to do that.

1557
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,346
So I'm trying to be better.

1558
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:04,948
- Yeah, and I do want
to take a second.

1559
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:09,019
Ethan, Meatball, and Tyler,
I'm sorry about Bruges.

1560
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:11,988
You guys did not deserve
to have your date cancelled

1561
01:03:12,055 --> 01:03:14,175
and I want to thank you all
for being so understanding

1562
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:16,359
and for always being able
to pick me up.

1563
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:18,728
But I'm sorry
you guys had to do that.

1564
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,901
- And, look, I know you both
had some very emotional

1565
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:27,203
connections on this journey,
and of course,

1566
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:31,241
that always leads to very, very
tough and difficult goodbyes.

1567
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,943
Rachel, I want to ask you
about Tyler.

1568
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,046
Saying goodbye to him
on his Hometown date,

1569
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:38,882
on the boardwalk, in New Jersey,

1570
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:40,216
before you even met his family,

1571
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:41,794
I know that had to be
really, really difficult.

1572
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:42,818
- Yeah.

1573
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:44,921
I really did feel
like we've always

1574
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,823
had such a great connection.

1575
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:50,026
I knew the importance
of family to Tyler.

1576
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:53,229
And I knew
the level that I needed

1577
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:54,964
to be at that night for him.

1578
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,100
And I didn't think I could
get there in the end.

1579
01:03:57,167 --> 01:04:00,136
But I do want to thank you
so much for all of our time

1580
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:02,872
together because I cherish
every moment of it,

1581
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:03,873
I truly do.

1582
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,343
- It was tough, but honestly,

1583
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,912
I think you did everything
perfectly.

1584
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,815
I know that it didn't end
the way I wanted it to,

1585
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,917
but I respect what you did

1586
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,819
and you did it
with the most class.

1587
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:19,356
Your best attribute is being
able to show how you feel

1588
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:21,057
and wearing your heart
on your sleeve,

1589
01:04:21,124 --> 01:04:22,601
and that's something
I respect so much.

1590
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,625
So I just want to say
you're absolutely incredible.

1591
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:29,399
- All right, Gabby.

1592
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:31,534
Your goodbye
with Nate in Amsterdam

1593
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:35,071
was probably one of the most,
if not the most emotional

1594
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:37,140
goodbye that we'd ever seen.

1595
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,576
What's it like
seeing Nate again?

1596
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,244
- It feels so good
to see you again

1597
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:44,914
because you did have such
an impression on my journey.

1598
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,349
Not only with me personally,

1599
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:49,252
but I do think you were
such a leader for all the men

1600
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:51,087
in how well you treat women.

1601
01:04:51,154 --> 01:04:52,255
- Thank you so much.

1602
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:53,666
You know, I know
our journey didn't end

1603
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,024
the way I wanted it to,

1604
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:57,894
but I don't think because
it ended it wasn't beautiful.

1605
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:00,096
We had
one of the best friendships

1606
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:03,066
that led into, like,
a great relationship

1607
01:05:03,133 --> 01:05:05,368
and just seeing it back
and watching us grow,

1608
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:07,937
I get emotional every time
because no matter if I watch it

1609
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,140
five times or 30 times,
like, it was real

1610
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:11,341
and it was raw.

1611
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,410
And I appreciate you
giving me the chance

1612
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:16,246
and the time to explore it,
you know?

1613
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:20,283
How you handled it
with so much class,

1614
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:24,721
like, I think the way that we
ended things was beautiful

1615
01:05:24,788 --> 01:05:28,158
because you know how momentous
meeting my daughter

1616
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,460
would've been and how much
that would've meant to me,

1617
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:32,207
and for me to open up
that part of my life,

1618
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:35,064
and I cannot thank you enough
and tell you

1619
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:37,667
how much I admire you
and I still adore you.

1620
01:05:37,734 --> 01:05:41,838
Thank you. Oh, my God.

1621
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:49,145
- Enough with the serious
stuff, though, all right?

1622
01:05:49,212 --> 01:05:51,347
Time to lighten the mood.
We all agree?

1623
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:53,383
- Bloopers!
- Oh, that's right!

1624
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,819
You know exactly what
I'm talking about!

1625
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:58,855
It's blooper time!

1626
01:06:00,857 --> 01:06:02,692
- My conversation
with Eric is gonna look

1627
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:05,061
completely different than
my conversation with Jason,

1628
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:06,272
and that's gonna look different.

1629
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,465
That is...

1630
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:11,301
Oh, it likes pineapple.

1631
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:13,403
- That thing is brave as hell.

1632
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,838
- Yeah.
- Well, it sounds...

1633
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:15,839
It sounds like this week...

1634
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:17,774
- It "sownds."
- It "sownds."

1635
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:19,375
Let me feed you.

1636
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:23,146
You know...

1637
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:26,916
What the?

1638
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,952
- Not, like, really trying
to be in drama, and...

1639
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:32,121
- I'm sorry, there's, like,
a moth flying around your head.

1640
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:34,824
Who was that?

1641
01:06:34,891 --> 01:06:36,659
Oh, my God, I just farted.

1642
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:39,128
Sorry. Hold your breath.
I just farted Chinese food.

1643
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:41,598
You're good. Am I?

1644
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:42,966
- Oh, it smells a little.

1645
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:44,734
- Oh, no, I think I'm good.

1646
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:46,503
I need to shave, though.

1647
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:48,147
- Is it still manly
or is it a hot tub...

1648
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:50,707
- Yeah, no, it smells good.

1649
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:53,243
What you got?

1650
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:55,545
Ooh, that smells sweet.

1651
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:57,680
Oh, my God.

1652
01:06:57,747 --> 01:06:59,983
- Let me smell your armpits.

1653
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,384
- How do they smell?

1654
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:03,753
- Better.

1655
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,555
I don't smell that bad!

1656
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:08,291
- Please welcome
to the stage Alec.

1657
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:13,530
- Oh, my God!

1658
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:15,431
- Not the props!

1659
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:17,133
- Oh, my God!

1660
01:07:18,902 --> 01:07:20,503
- That candle was asking for it.

1661
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:24,807
- Protein power bars!

1662
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,343
- I did this with my...
- Oh.

1663
01:07:29,012 --> 01:07:31,314
Oh, my gosh, I can't
get over this view.

1664
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:34,183
- And our first champagne
celebration to many.

1665
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,319
- A toast to the Bachelorettes.

1666
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:37,487
- To husbands!

1667
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,923
- To getting engaged!
- Yeah!

1668
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:41,791
Oh!

1669
01:07:41,858 --> 01:07:45,295
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
How do I stop it?

1670
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:48,331
- Cheers.

1671
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,400
Meant for this!

1672
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:55,104
- Whoo!

1673
01:07:57,674 --> 01:08:00,343
- Well, bloopers are
like a box of chocolates.

1674
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,654
You never know
what you're gonna get.

1675
01:08:01,678 --> 01:08:03,389
By the way, there's been
more arm pit smelling

1676
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:06,382
on this season
than in any season before this.

1677
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:07,483
Okay, do not go anywhere.

1678
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,419
We've got
that exclusive sneak peek

1679
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:12,021
at the finale that everybody's
gonna be talking about,

1680
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,524
is gonna be tweeting about,
probably crying about.

1681
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:15,868
You are not gonna
want to miss it.

1682
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:17,193
We'll be right back.

1683
01:08:29,806 --> 01:08:31,975
- Welcome back
to the "Men Tell All."

1684
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:35,178
I'm here with Gabby and Rachel
and all of their ex-boyfriends.

1685
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:37,547
We've gotten some closure,
we've also shared some laughs,

1686
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,950
and now I've got one more
surprise for all of you.

1687
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,952
You ready for this?

1688
01:08:43,019 --> 01:08:45,421
Just trying to keep you
on your toes here.

1689
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:47,423
Now, I know there are
a lot of men here tonight,

1690
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,092
but Gabby and Rachel,
big question.

1691
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:50,727
How would you feel
if I brought out

1692
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:54,897
a couple of... bros
to the stage?

1693
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:56,041
Would you feel okay with that?

1694
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:57,409
We got two more bros.
- Bring them on.

1695
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:59,168
- Please welcome
the hilarious stars

1696
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:00,737
of the new movie "Bros,"

1697
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,839
Billy Eichner
and Luke Macfarlane!

1698
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:09,278
- Hi. Hello.
- Where do we go?

1699
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:11,280
- We're going up here?
So nice to meet you.

1700
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:12,548
- Hi, I'm Billy.
- Hi.

1701
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:14,717
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

1702
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:16,753
- Billy, great to see you.
- Thank you.

1703
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,589
- Guys, Billy, Luke, thank you
so much for being here.

1704
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:21,166
- Oh, my God.
- Look at all those bros!

1705
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,492
- Look at all those bros.

1706
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:24,661
- Amazing.
- So few socks.

1707
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:27,263
- Yeah, no one's wearing socks.
- No one's wearing socks.

1708
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:31,034
- I support it, for the record.
I love ankles.

1709
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,540
- It's so great
having you both here.

1710
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:33,903
Thank you so much
for joining us.

1711
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:35,314
- Yeah, thanks for having us.
- And Billy, look, I know

1712
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:37,116
you're a very proud member
of Bachelor Nation.

1713
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,074
- Yes!

1714
01:09:38,141 --> 01:09:39,909
- You made a cameo

1715
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:41,587
on Colton Underwood's
season of "The Bachelor."

1716
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:43,046
- I made more than a cameo.

1717
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:44,714
- You did.
You had quite the impact.

1718
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:45,891
Tell us about that.
- Yes, I did.

1719
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:47,083
- It was one of the gayest...

1720
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:50,319
I mean greatest moments
of my entire life.

1721
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:51,864
- You're like
a modern-day Nostradamus.

1722
01:09:51,888 --> 01:09:55,558
- Yes, I asked Colton
if he was gay on "The Bachelor"

1723
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:57,260
before we knew that about him.

1724
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,328
- And lo and behold.
- I just asked as a joke

1725
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:00,863
and it turned out
it wasn't a joke.

1726
01:10:02,265 --> 01:10:03,599
- We're so happy
you're both here.

1727
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:05,277
And I think I speak on behalf
of all of Bachelor Nation

1728
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:09,238
when I say we cannot wait
to watch the movie "Bros."

1729
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:11,407
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,
this is brought to us

1730
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:13,142
by the same team that did

1731
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,887
"Forgetting Sarah Marshall"
and "Trainwreck."

1732
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:17,613
So this really could be
the funniest movie of the year.

1733
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,582
- Yeah, they also did
"Bridesmaids,"

1734
01:10:19,649 --> 01:10:21,250
"40-Year-Old Virgin,"
"Superbad."

1735
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:22,251
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

1736
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:23,352
- Yeah.
- Everything.

1737
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:25,054
- "Bros" is also
the first gay rom-com

1738
01:10:25,121 --> 01:10:26,989
ever made by a major studio,
ever.

1739
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,791
- That's right.
So this is groundbreaking.

1740
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:30,159
- Yeah.

1741
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,228
- I mean, how cool is it
to work on a project

1742
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:33,596
like that that's so historic?

1743
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:34,840
- I mean, it's great. Honestly.

1744
01:10:34,864 --> 01:10:36,032
And the funny thing is,

1745
01:10:36,099 --> 01:10:38,201
you don't know
a lot of these people,

1746
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:39,469
but they're all stars.

1747
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:40,713
And I think you're gonna
fall in love with them.

1748
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:41,804
- Well, that's awesome.

1749
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:45,184
All right, Bachelor Nation,
who's ready

1750
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:46,509
for an exclusive sneak peek

1751
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,111
of the exciting new movie
"Bros"?

1752
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:50,847
- Yeah!
- Let's take a look.

1753
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,915
- I'm 40 years old.
I've never been in love.

1754
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:54,016
- And are you happy?

1755
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,318
- Who's happy all the time?

1756
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:56,552
- A lot of people.

1757
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,188
- Bobby, I had sex
with that 65-year-old.

1758
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,690
- Jeez, he's ripped.
- I know.

1759
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,892
It's like they injected
steroids into Dumbledore.

1760
01:11:04,327 --> 01:11:06,127
- You met a guy.
- I don't think I'm his type.

1761
01:11:06,162 --> 01:11:07,663
He's like gay Tom Brady.

1762
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,308
- Maybe you're both bottoms
and that's the problem.

1763
01:11:09,332 --> 01:11:10,500
- Bottom dance!

1764
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:12,935
- Ooh, bottom dance!
- Yeah!

1765
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:14,437
Oh, my God.

1766
01:11:14,504 --> 01:11:15,705
Gay sex was more fun

1767
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:18,207
when straight people were
uncomfortable with it.

1768
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,244
- You're a very emotional guy,
and that's great.

1769
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,146
- I see what you like.
Meathead idiots.

1770
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:24,647
I can be tough like your boys.

1771
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:26,091
That's what you like, huh?

1772
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,283
- Hey, what's going on?

1773
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:29,685
- Oh.
- That's cool.

1774
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:30,787
- My bad.

1775
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:31,888
- "Bros." Rated R.

1776
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,657
- Are we dating?
- No.

1777
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:37,226
- Only in theaters
September 30th.

1778
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,661
- I love the way
you noticed that.

1779
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:39,962
- Yeah, listen, I gotta ask,

1780
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,899
when you work on a project
like this,

1781
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,867
do you learn anything
about dating?

1782
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:46,602
- Yeah, well,
the whole movie was inspired

1783
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:49,038
by our dating lives
and the lives or our friends,

1784
01:11:49,105 --> 01:11:51,240
so it's all about
the dos and don'ts of dating.

1785
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,675
All the important things,
you know?

1786
01:11:52,742 --> 01:11:56,279
- This really is, like,
a boy-meets-bro love story.

1787
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:57,747
- That's what it's about, yeah.

1788
01:11:57,814 --> 01:12:00,650
We do all the things you see
in any love story, you know?

1789
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:02,418
We drive each other crazy,
we fall in love,

1790
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:04,253
we fight, there's sex.

1791
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,822
It's all a lot of fun.

1792
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:07,323
- It's gonna be great.

1793
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:09,358
Gabby and Rachel,
I want to ask you a favor.

1794
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:11,828
Because we're so lucky to have
both Billy and Luke here,

1795
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,396
I thought we'd play
a little game.

1796
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:15,097
Are you guys down?
- Down, always.

1797
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,533
- Okay, It's a game that I like
to call "The Bros Decide

1798
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,168
Dating Dos and Don'ts."

1799
01:12:19,235 --> 01:12:22,038
And what we're gonna do is
show clips from the season

1800
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:23,506
and let Billy and Luke decide

1801
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:24,907
if that is a dating do or don't.

1802
01:12:24,974 --> 01:12:26,309
- Oh, this is gonna be good.

1803
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:27,686
- Are you both down?
- Less for us, more for them.

1804
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:28,644
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wow.

1805
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:29,979
- I hope you guys are ready.

1806
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:31,857
Gentlemen, you should all be
nervous right about now.

1807
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:33,950
Everybody ready for this?
- Unless it's about me.

1808
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:35,518
All right.

1809
01:12:35,585 --> 01:12:38,821
So first up, I've heard
when it comes to a first date

1810
01:12:38,888 --> 01:12:42,024
that you really can't
prepare too much.

1811
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:44,627
But then again, maybe you can.

1812
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:47,163
Uh-oh.

1813
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:50,366
- So you guys have
30 minutes to prepare

1814
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:52,001
and you guys better bring it.

1815
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:54,503
- Oh, mysterious. I like it.
- Nice.

1816
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,747
- What's in...
Yeah, what's in there?

1817
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:56,806
- Open it up.

1818
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:58,417
- I was thinking,
"Oh, what's in the bags?

1819
01:12:58,441 --> 01:13:00,309
You know, what kind of gifts?
I love gifts."

1820
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,545
- Hey.
- Oh, Speedos.

1821
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:05,348
- Little did I know it was
gonna be this type of gift.

1822
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:10,686
- Yeah, they don't
cover up very much.

1823
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:12,922
- I need some extra help too.

1824
01:13:12,989 --> 01:13:14,290
- Some guys who maybe felt like

1825
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:15,858
you didn't stand out
with the talent,

1826
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:17,469
like, maybe stuff the Speedo
to stand out a little bit.

1827
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:20,663
- I'm sure some people stuffed.

1828
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,865
- Gonna let it
all hang out there.

1829
01:13:22,932 --> 01:13:24,500
- No.
- All right.

1830
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:27,946
All right, Billy, Luke,
what do you think?

1831
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:29,472
Dating do or don't?

1832
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:32,575
- First of all, that looked
more like the set of "Bros"

1833
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:35,344
than I thought it would.
- Yeah.

1834
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,446
- I don't know about
the stuffing.

1835
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:39,515
I don't... I think
that's a dating don't.

1836
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,026
- Yeah, because if the date
goes well,

1837
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,985
eventually
they're gonna find out.

1838
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:46,055
- Yeah.
I like to do the opposite.

1839
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:47,323
I make myself bad.

1840
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:48,491
That way when I show up,

1841
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:50,092
people are pleasantly surprised.

1842
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,661
You know?

1843
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:53,071
- I just want to know
who out there thinks

1844
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:54,873
it's a good idea to put
themselves in the position

1845
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:56,933
in the first place, as a guy,
to be in a Speedo.

1846
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,768
- Before you answer that,
I actually think

1847
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:01,671
you should tell us, do you guys
like seeing a guy in a Speedo?

1848
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:03,205
- Oh, we loved it.
- 100%. Yeah.

1849
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,440
- There you go.
- All right.

1850
01:14:04,507 --> 01:14:06,609
There you go.
- What's there not to like?

1851
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:07,836
- Maybe that's why it took me

1852
01:14:07,877 --> 01:14:09,979
about 40-something years
to get married.

1853
01:14:10,046 --> 01:14:11,547
I hadn't figured
that one out yet.

1854
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:13,115
All right, up next, they say

1855
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:15,985
you always remember
your first kiss,

1856
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:18,587
but I think this next kiss,
that it may be one

1857
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:22,358
that both parties
would love to forget.

1858
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:24,360
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

1859
01:14:24,427 --> 01:14:26,062
- You look very beautiful.

1860
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,097
- Oh, thank you.
You as well.

1861
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:29,699
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1862
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:45,481
- I was just...

1863
01:14:45,548 --> 01:14:46,983
- No, I'm glad you did.
- Okay.

1864
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:48,460
- Yeah.
- I looked at you,

1865
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:51,988
I was like, I just really
wanted to show you something.

1866
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:54,190
- I was really excited
to talk to Mario.

1867
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:55,691
He's a great kisser.

1868
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:57,526
He's kind of
giving me butterflies.

1869
01:14:57,593 --> 01:15:00,196
Oh, you're so sweet.
- So are you.

1870
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:01,773
So thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.

1871
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:03,132
- No, thank you.

1872
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:05,668
- Yeah.
- All right. All right.

1873
01:15:05,735 --> 01:15:09,505
That was a beautiful moment
shared between Mario and Gabby.

1874
01:15:09,572 --> 01:15:11,974
How did Mario do?
Dating do or don't?

1875
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:14,210
- It was an intense kiss.

1876
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,012
It was a lot, yeah.

1877
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:18,481
- But you both kept going back
for a little bit more,

1878
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:19,815
so how did it feel?

1879
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:20,950
It looked like...

1880
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:23,252
- Yeah, I know.
I think it was nice.

1881
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:25,521
Yeah.

1882
01:15:25,588 --> 01:15:28,090
- I think for me, like,
that was the first time

1883
01:15:28,157 --> 01:15:30,760
I had spoke with Gabby,
and so when you were like,

1884
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:32,204
"He's a great kisser,"
I was like, "Yeah."

1885
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:33,405
And then I got on, like, Twitter

1886
01:15:33,429 --> 01:15:35,069
and I was like, "Oh, no,"
and everybody...

1887
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:37,665
- I think it was our position.

1888
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,868
We were like this.
- Yeah.

1889
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:40,236
We were reaching.

1890
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:41,804
- But, you know, whatever works.

1891
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,315
- Right. Right.
- It was the first one.

1892
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:45,908
- And then you kissed her hand
at the end of all of that.

1893
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:47,285
- Really want to just,
like, stamp it.

1894
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:49,189
Like, just, like, make sure
you finished it off.

1895
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:52,114
Okay, we've all heard
the famous saying

1896
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:53,582
that the way to anyone's heart

1897
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:55,284
is through their stomachs,
right?

1898
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:56,485
- Okay.
- But is that true

1899
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:59,121
when it comes
to our guy Meatball?

1900
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:01,223
- Yeah! Come on.

1901
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,892
All right, ladies.

1902
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,827
You know my nickname
is Meatball.

1903
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:06,762
- Nice.
- Oh, no.

1904
01:16:06,829 --> 01:16:08,931
- What are meatballs...

1905
01:16:08,998 --> 01:16:10,666
- I'm scared.
- Without some sauce?

1906
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:15,771
No!

1907
01:16:15,838 --> 01:16:17,673
- No! Ugh!

1908
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,810
- No! No! No!
- God.

1909
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:22,211
- Ew!
- Ah!

1910
01:16:22,278 --> 01:16:24,647
- It smells just like spaghetti.

1911
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:27,516
I'm Italian,
but I don't do canned sauce.

1912
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:33,189
- Yes.
I appreciate it.

1913
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,624
I appreciate it. Go, Meatball.
- Go, Meatball.

1914
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:37,860
- Go, Meatball.
- It's the dedication for me.

1915
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:40,396
- I have PTSD
watching that back.

1916
01:16:40,463 --> 01:16:42,364
What do you think?
- I was turned on.

1917
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:43,933
I... yeah!

1918
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:45,734
- Yeah, Meatball. Attaboy.

1919
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:48,571
- Yes.
- Attaboy.

1920
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:50,573
I was into it.
- I liked it.

1921
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:53,008
- It was unforgettable. Okay.

1922
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:54,086
What'd you guys
think of the game?

1923
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:55,478
So much fun.

1924
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:57,456
Thank you guys so much
for being here, Billy and Luke.

1925
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,200
Everybody...
- Wait a second. Wait a second.

1926
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:00,549
- Uh, yeah?

1927
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:03,252
- I think someone has
a special gift for Meatball

1928
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:04,720
that they were gonna bring me.

1929
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:05,721
No?
- Oh, no.

1930
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:06,856
- Yes!
- Oh.

1931
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:08,891
- Oh, no.
- Oh! Meatball, do it!

1932
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,993
- Meatball.

1933
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,328
- Meatball!
- Do it!

1934
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:15,531
Meatball, Meatball,
Meatball, Meatball!

1935
01:17:15,598 --> 01:17:18,834
- You know he's gonna.
- No! No!

1936
01:17:18,901 --> 01:17:20,836
- Take your clothes off!

1937
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:25,441
- Let's go!
- Strip! Strip!

1938
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:27,042
- What is going on here?

1939
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,178
Meatball is taking
his clothes off.

1940
01:17:29,245 --> 01:17:30,946
Literally,
what's happening here?

1941
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:32,581
It's...

1942
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,359
Meatball, Meatball,
Meatball, Meatball!

1943
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,752
- Meatball...
I do not want this to happen.

1944
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:39,321
Meatball, Meatball,
Meatball, Meatball!

1945
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:40,823
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

1946
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:42,925
- Get in there!

1947
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:46,095
- Oh, my God,
he's down on one knee.

1948
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:51,167
I can't.

1949
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:52,935
- Oh, no!

1950
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:54,270
- Oh!

1951
01:17:57,273 --> 01:18:00,242
- Go see "Bros"
on September 30th!

1952
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:05,214
- Oh, my God.

1953
01:18:05,281 --> 01:18:06,682
- This is the best moment on TV.

1954
01:18:06,749 --> 01:18:08,450
- Oh, my God.

1955
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,419
I cannot believe
what I just saw.

1956
01:18:10,486 --> 01:18:12,388
Bachelor Nation,
don't miss "Bros."

1957
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:14,190
It's only in theaters
September 30th.

1958
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:16,425
- Coming up...
- Meatball! Meatball!

1959
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:18,136
- I don't even know
what's happening right now.

1960
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,697
How do our two Bachelorettes
navigate these final days?

1961
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:24,166
Will Gabby and Rachel find love
at the end of their journey

1962
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:25,801
or are they gonna leave
brokenhearted?

1963
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:27,503
Don't go anywhere.

1964
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:40,182
- Welcome back
to the "Men Tell All."

1965
01:18:40,249 --> 01:18:42,151
Yes, after tackling
Billy Eichner,

1966
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,086
Meatball is still here
and I know that

1967
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:45,487
because I can smell him.

1968
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:48,300
Meatball, you look like
you still got

1969
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:49,491
some sauce on your collar.

1970
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,394
- I know. Saving it for later.
- Leftovers.

1971
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:54,339
- We tried to clean up Meatball
the best we could.

1972
01:18:54,363 --> 01:18:57,800
Okay, Gabby, Rachel, look,
you both made history

1973
01:18:57,866 --> 01:18:59,201
this season as Bachelorettes.

1974
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:00,903
I know it hasn't
always been easy,

1975
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,814
but I wanted to take
the chance to tell you both,

1976
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:05,908
you need to know just how proud
I am of the two of you.

1977
01:19:05,975 --> 01:19:09,111
I've just been
so amazed at your ability

1978
01:19:09,178 --> 01:19:10,512
and how you've
handled everything,

1979
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:12,081
how you've supported each other.

1980
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:15,317
It really has been incredible
to watch you two do all this.

1981
01:19:15,384 --> 01:19:16,652
And I know it's not over yet.

1982
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:19,521
- Thank you.
- Of course, yeah. Listen.

1983
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,690
I do want to ask you both
each one final question.

1984
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,792
Rachel, any regrets?

1985
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:25,894
- I don't think I have
any regrets at all.

1986
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:29,231
I think a lot of people can
look at us being emotional

1987
01:19:29,298 --> 01:19:31,100
and judge us from the outside,

1988
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:34,436
but I think Gabby and I,
being able to wear our heart

1989
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:35,904
on our sleeve is brave of us.

1990
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:37,806
And I'm so proud of you.

1991
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:41,777
- I'm so proud of you. Aww.

1992
01:19:41,844 --> 01:19:43,512
- And do you stand
by all the decisions

1993
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:44,990
you've made thus far?
- Of course. Yeah.

1994
01:19:45,014 --> 01:19:47,416
And if I didn't,
I would never tell you.

1995
01:19:47,483 --> 01:19:50,386
Just keep those to yourself.

1996
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,197
- Yeah, those are for me
to know and you never.

1997
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:55,124
- You got a good poker face.
I like it.

1998
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,859
There's obviously so many twists

1999
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:58,394
and turns that are coming up.

2000
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,739
I really do think that Bachelor
Nation is gonna be shocked.

2001
01:20:00,763 --> 01:20:02,598
Two Bachelorettes, six men,

2002
01:20:02,665 --> 01:20:04,166
all hoping for a chance at love.

2003
01:20:04,233 --> 01:20:05,868
So what's gonna happen?

2004
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:08,837
You're not going to believe it.

2005
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:10,882
Gabby and Rachel, they vowed
to do things their way,

2006
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:12,207
and they did.

2007
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,743
So what's this shocking ending
that nobody,

2008
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,979
nobody is going to see coming?

2009
01:20:17,046 --> 01:20:20,949
Here's a look at one
of the craziest endings ever.

2010
01:20:22,885 --> 01:20:24,386
- I'm so scared.

2011
01:20:24,453 --> 01:20:26,355
- You got this.

2012
01:20:26,422 --> 01:20:27,723
Whoo!

2013
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:29,458
- Bienvenidos.

2014
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:31,060
I am in love now.

2015
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:34,530
I just want to hold on to it
for as long as I can.

2016
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:36,465
It means so much
that you're here

2017
01:20:36,532 --> 01:20:38,467
because you've always made me
feel so safe.

2018
01:20:38,534 --> 01:20:40,169
You're good, Rach.

2019
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:42,404
- I fully expect to be
getting down on one knee.

2020
01:20:42,471 --> 01:20:45,507
- We had the best time.
I feel like I fit in perfectly.

2021
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:46,775
- Welcome.

2022
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,277
- I'm on cloud nine.

2023
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:49,778
I'm falling in love with you.

2024
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:53,248
And I'm ready for an engagement.

2025
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:55,417
- This is the moment
during Clayton's season

2026
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:57,486
where everything went haywire.

2027
01:20:57,553 --> 01:20:59,588
The last thing
your dad said to me, like,

2028
01:20:59,655 --> 01:21:01,123
was that they don't like me.

2029
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,791
I'm scared to move forward.

2030
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:06,228
- After Fantasy Suite,
everything took, like, a 180.

2031
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:07,696
I felt blindsided.

2032
01:21:07,763 --> 01:21:09,965
That was the last thing
I could've ever expected.

2033
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:12,267
- You know, I don't like
picturing the girl

2034
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,612
that, like, I'm in love with
doing that with somebody else.

2035
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:16,238
Like, that crushes me.

2036
01:21:16,305 --> 01:21:18,273
- He was testing me.

2037
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,776
That's, like,
not something you do

2038
01:21:20,843 --> 01:21:22,878
to someone that you love.

2039
01:21:22,945 --> 01:21:24,580
- Just take a minute, honey.

2040
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:26,715
This is all a lot.

2041
01:21:26,782 --> 01:21:31,220
- I tried so hard to not be
reckless with other people,

2042
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:34,189
and he was reckless with me.

2043
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:35,591
- I just love her.

2044
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:37,426
I want the best for her.

2045
01:21:37,493 --> 01:21:38,727
- I'm so conflicted now.

2046
01:21:38,794 --> 01:21:40,629
I just don't understand.

2047
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:43,031
You told me things
and then you went back

2048
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:44,833
against what you said.

2049
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:48,771
- I want to be fully honest
and transparent.

2050
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:51,807
- He took advantage
of everything.

2051
01:21:51,874 --> 01:21:55,310
He never loved me.

2052
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:58,714
Is it me?

2053
01:21:58,781 --> 01:22:02,384
What is it about me
that's so hard to love?

2054
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:07,389
Now we're literally
about to be engaged tomorrow

2055
01:22:07,456 --> 01:22:08,957
to our dream guys.

2056
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:11,493
- Literally dreams.
- Mm-hmm.

2057
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,797
- I just don't want him
to feel pressure.

2058
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:16,732
- But it is what you want.

2059
01:22:16,799 --> 01:22:19,101
You want someone who's gonna
commit to you for life.

2060
01:22:19,168 --> 01:22:21,570
- Right.
- And who is 100% sure.

2061
01:22:21,637 --> 01:22:23,005
- Yeah.

2062
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,441
I feel like all my dreams
are, like, coming true.

2063
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:36,351
- Wow, I told you.

2064
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:37,738
It's gonna be
absolutely shocking.

2065
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,221
You want to see it all unfold?

2066
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:41,256
Well, please join us
next Monday night

2067
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:43,725
as the journey continues
building to a finale

2068
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:46,228
that promises to be
one of the most intense,

2069
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:49,598
unpredictable,
and just totally insane endings

2070
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:51,400
in "Bachelorette" history.

2071
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:53,202
It's been an incredible
night tonight.

2072
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:54,703
I want to give a big thank you

2073
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56,171
to our incredible Bachelorettes,

2074
01:22:56,238 --> 01:22:57,372
Gabby and Rachel.

2075
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:59,241
- Thank you.

2076
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:00,548
- Of course, to all of our men.

2077
01:23:02,511 --> 01:23:05,581
And our amazing studio audience.

2078
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:08,150
For everybody here, to all
of you, Bachelor Nation,

2079
01:23:08,217 --> 01:23:09,451
I'm Jesse Palmer.

2080
01:23:09,518 --> 01:23:10,786
Goodnight.

2081
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:18,670
- All right, next up,
this clip asks

2082
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:20,329
the all-important question,

2083
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:23,599
how much information
is too much information

2084
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:24,933
when you first meet?

2085
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,802
- Hmm.
- Uh-oh.

2086
01:23:26,869 --> 01:23:28,604
- Hello.
- Hello.

2087
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:29,605
Hi.

2088
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,875
My name is Quincey, aka Prince.

2089
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:35,611
And just, you know, a little
background story of me,

2090
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:40,048
you know, I haven't had sex
in a year and almost a half.

2091
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:42,751
So I've been saving
for the right person.

2092
01:23:42,818 --> 01:23:44,128
You guys have a nice one.
- We'll see you inside.

2093
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:45,754
- You too.
- He was like,

2094
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:46,931
"I haven't had sex
in a year and a half."

2095
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:48,657
I was like,
"That makes one of us."

2096
01:23:48,724 --> 01:23:50,759
- Do you know
who you're talking to?

2097
01:23:50,826 --> 01:23:54,062
Yeah.

2098
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:56,164
- Wow.
- All right.

2099
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:59,301
Your sex life
and how much time has elapsed

2100
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:01,703
since your last encounter.

2101
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:03,705
- I appreciate the honesty.

2102
01:24:03,772 --> 01:24:06,308
Maybe not on a first date,
but, you know.

2103
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:07,976
- I don't know, that's tough.

2104
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,311
That's a tough one.

2105
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:10,445
- How's it going?

2106
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:14,383
Are you...

2107
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:17,119
- Have you had sex since?
- What is it now? Yeah.

2108
01:24:17,143 --> 01:24:19,143
