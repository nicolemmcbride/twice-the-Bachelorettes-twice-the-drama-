1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,936
- Tonight on
"The Bachelorette"...

2
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:08,008
- I don't know if I'm aroused
or if I'm just like scared.

3
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,879
- Whoo!
We're in Amsterdam.

4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,280
- I know, I can't believe it.

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,449
Hi!
- Hey, what's up?

6
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,917
Oh!

7
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,695
- When you feel so
strongly about somebody,

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,487
it's like,
you do want every second

9
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:23,490
you can with her and every
memory you can make with her.

10
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,759
It's crazy to say, but...

11
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,128
I'm falling in love with you,
and...

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,897
Oh, my gosh.

13
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,602
- Hey, sorry
to pop up unannounced.

14
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,170
I'm really, really sorry, Gabby.

15
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,539
I know how important it was.

16
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:39,949
I know how much you were
looking forward to it.

17
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,293
- It's kind
of a pit in my stomach

18
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,310
that I have
to make this decision.

19
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,854
- You never, like,
think in a million years

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,080
you're actually going
to end up at Hometowns.

21
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,448
- It's so real now.

22
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,484
- The fear is that
I'm falling really hard

23
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,185
for this girl and she's not.

24
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,987
- My heart
is beating out of my chest.

25
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,124
- And that never has
occurred to me until tonight.

26
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,659
- Sometimes, like,
love is like this.

27
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,695
You want it to work so, so bad.

28
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,534
I can't think clearly.

29
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,956
- For the past couple weeks,

30
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,925
Gabby and I have been
traveling around Europe,

31
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:35,796
sailing on this ship
for the chance at love.

32
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,098
It's just so romantic.

33
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:41,735
Gabby's side, my side,
we really have the best group

34
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:44,237
of guys, more than I could
have ever asked for.

35
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,807
They make me feel
absolutely incredible.

36
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,051
- I'm excited,
though, for this week.

37
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,142
- I am, too.

38
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,520
It's deep in the game now.

39
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:54,848
- This week,
we are sailing to Amsterdam.

40
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:57,918
And I'm so excited to be here.

41
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,295
- Have you
ever been to Amsterdam?

42
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,421
- No, have you?
- No, I'm so excited!

43
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,932
- It's so beautiful here.

44
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:16,169
Gabby and I are both feeling
so hopeful about this week.

45
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,739
I definitely think
with Hometowns being

46
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,975
around the corner, it's
getting so much more serious.

47
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,777
We're about to involve families

48
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,580
and it's a really big decision
for me.

49
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,181
- I'm excited for this week.

50
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,525
Hometowns are
going to be so crazy.

51
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,884
- Yeah.

52
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,286
- I am truly excited to spend
time with the men here

53
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:38,892
in Amsterdam, but I know it's
gonna be another big, big week.

54
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,227
I look at these men

55
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,429
and I can see a future
with each of 'em.

56
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:46,133
Whoever I give a rose to this
week is going to Hometowns,

57
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,269
and it is a big step
in a relationship.

58
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:53,440
So I definitely want to think
long and hard

59
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,342
and make a good decision,

60
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:59,379
because I would never want
to put someone through

61
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:04,184
me meeting their family if I
didn't see a future with them.

62
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,553
- Oh, my gosh,
we're in Amsterdam!

63
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,356
- I know, I can't believe it.
It's so active.

64
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,358
I've never seen so many boats...

65
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,194
- I know.
- Or bikes in one city.

66
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,562
- This is crazy.
- Cheers.

67
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,930
- Oh, cheers to you!

68
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,699
- To European adventures.

69
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:19,933
- They continue!

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,636
I can't believe we're here.
- I know.

71
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,504
- We're going to Hometowns,
it's like...

72
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,206
I remember the second we were,

73
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,717
like, going into Hometowns
and, like...

74
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,676
- Mm-hmm.
- It's just a new chapter.

75
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,154
- Yeah, completely.
- It's completely different.

76
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,689
- It's a whole different story.
- Mm-hmm.

77
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:33,814
- Yeah.

78
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,016
- So,

79
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,452
who are you bringing
on this date?

80
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,488
- Uh...

81
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,329
- New week, new opportunity,

82
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,631
beautiful new country
that we're in.

83
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,133
Can't wait to see Rachel.

84
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,636
So for, you know, someone who
hasn't had a one-on-one yet,

85
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,706
to have that the week
before Hometowns

86
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,341
would be... would be huge.

87
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,843
Oh.

88
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,713
- I would love to have
a day with Rachel,

89
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,948
like, more than anything.

90
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,883
Just spend
an entire day with her.

91
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,985
Like, enjoy Amsterdam.

92
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,824
This is somebody I see
my entire life with, so...

93
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,659
fingers crossed.

94
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:27,434
- Zach, let's let
our love bloom.

95
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:28,935
Love, Rachel.

96
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,004
- Oh, wow.

97
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,473
That's pretty incredible.

98
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,277
I mean, this is all I could
ask for right before Hometowns.

99
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,012
Yeah, can't wait
to spend this time

100
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,447
with her here in Amsterdam.

101
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,083
This is... this is insane.

102
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,418
- You can't help when
you don't get, like,

103
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:49,222
- the date card to be like...
- Like, what the?

104
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,925
Right now, like,
all I'm privileged to know

105
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:55,962
is that the scoreboard
reads this week that Zach wins

106
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,331
the amazing one-on-one,

107
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,033
and his second one.

108
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,535
It was pretty gutting
hearing, like,

109
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,304
a stupid card not for you.

110
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:07,808
I'm gonna go to the gym.
I have some pouting to do.

111
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,483
- Yeah, new week, guys.
Group date one-on-ones.

112
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,285
I feel like the one-on-one's
gonna be big

113
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,719
for whoever gets it this week.

114
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,226
Obviously, there's a lot
on the line.

115
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,656
Hometown's coming up.

116
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,724
- This week is heavy.
I mean, I'm excited.

117
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,136
You can't not be excited to be
in Amsterdam and go on a date,

118
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,796
but for me, it's all about, you
know, growing in a relationship.

119
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,732
And just the more time you have,
like, that's important.

120
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,435
So today's one-on-one...
I need that.

121
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,906
- Me and Gabby have
a great connection

122
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,575
that I believe in
wholeheartedly,

123
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,611
but I really need some
one-on-one time

124
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,514
with deep conversations
to make her believe

125
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,349
that I'm someone who could meet

126
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,953
her family and she's
someone who can meet mine.

127
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,155
- Nate,

128
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,557
let's see where
our love takes us.

129
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:58,825
Heart, Gabby.

130
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,331
- Oh my gosh, I wasn't expecting

131
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,366
my name at all, honestly.

132
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,702
Yeah, uh, whew.

133
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:12,172
I was so happy that
I got the one-on-one.

134
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,079
- That's the same face
you made the first time.

135
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,213
I'm excited to spend time
with Gabby and

136
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,383
I really feel good about
the connection that

137
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,052
me and Gabby have
and where this is headed.

138
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,688
So I'm hopeful
that I will get a rose.

139
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,130
- Hometowns are,
like, next week.

140
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,999
- Yeah, it came so fast.

141
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,334
- I know, it's crazy
to even just say that to you,

142
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,945
'cause it feels like
we were just back in LA.

143
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,437
- Gabby, Rachel.

144
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,438
- Hi.
- Hi, Jesse!

145
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:46,585
- Hey, you two.
How are you?

146
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,750
- How's it going?
- So great to see you.

147
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:48,918
- I'm sorry,
I don't want to get up.

148
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,019
How are you... don't worry.

149
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,511
How are you?
It's great to see you.

150
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,647
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm doing great.

151
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:54,948
I love Amsterdam.

152
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,125
This is one of my favorite
cities in the world.

153
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,217
- Really?
- Yeah.

154
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,294
- You've been?
- How about you both?

155
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,786
- Excited to see the city today.

156
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,488
- Yeah, I'm excited
for you both, too.

157
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,665
- Yeah.
- How's this whole thing

158
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,129
going for you?
Is this thing working?

159
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,626
- I mean, I definitely think
it's working for both of us.

160
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,262
I think it is for sure for me.
- Yeah.

161
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,798
- We are getting to the point
we're involving families

162
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,501
and I do want to be sure
moving into next week.

163
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,436
I think today I'm bringing Zach,

164
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:19,039
and he was one of my
first one-on-ones.

165
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,816
- I feel like Zach's
really stepped up for you

166
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,051
in a lot of different ways.
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

167
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,386
- Do you see something
long term with Zach?

168
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,945
- I definitely think
I could, yeah.

169
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,947
- Really?
That's a great sign.

170
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,315
- I know.

171
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,492
- You think love's
in the air for you?

172
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,650
- I know.
- How you feeling?

173
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,752
- I think so,
I think a little too much.

174
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,299
- I know you have a one-on-one
with Nate today, right?

175
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,257
- Mm-hmm.
- You guys have

176
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,467
a really, really special thing.

177
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,659
- Yeah, definitely.

178
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:43,563
I think our connection
is kind of palpable.

179
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,807
When I'm with him,
I don't really

180
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,266
think about anything else.

181
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:50,637
And I think I just... I've never
really met anyone like him.

182
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,672
I know he's an amazing dad,

183
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,542
and he lights up when
he talks about his daughter.

184
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:59,379
But if... if I wanted to jump
into a commitment like that,

185
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:02,182
I would want to... like that,
I would want to be 100% ready.

186
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,750
- Yeah, for sure.
- Yeah.

187
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,419
- Big week, obviously,
with Hometowns next week.

188
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,722
- Mm-hmm.
- How does that make you feel?

189
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,190
- Nauseous.
- Yeah.

190
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,025
- What scares you about
Hometowns next week?

191
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,160
Or what gives you
any concern about that?

192
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,330
- Um, once you involve family,
you know,

193
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:18,798
your decisions
become more tough,

194
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,434
and you're involving
more than just one person.

195
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,403
So it's just hard
to balance, truly.

196
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,672
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

197
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,779
I'm just watching you,
and you seem a bit emotional.

198
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,042
Are you doing okay?

199
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,311
- Yeah, I think it's
just gonna be a hard week,

200
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,546
you know, with making
decisions and having

201
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,348
to think more logically.

202
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,126
- It's really tough.
These are tough decisions.

203
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,551
- Yeah.
- And emotional ones.

204
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:39,686
- Yeah.

205
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:40,687
- So I can appreciate
how you feel.

206
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,756
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

207
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,524
- With Hometowns being
next week,

208
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:48,728
I know I have to think about
involving the families.

209
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,865
- Big decisions coming up.
A lot on the line.

210
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:55,502
- Nate does have a daughter,
so I have to think about

211
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,270
both of them
when I'm making decisions.

212
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:58,605
- I know these are big dates,

213
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,915
so I wish you both the best,
all right?

214
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,484
- Thanks, Jesse.
- And we'll see you soon.

215
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,810
- Thank you.
- Enjoy Amsterdam.

216
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,747
- I take the potential
of being a mom

217
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:11,151
so seriously because of my past.

218
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,888
And, you know, at times,
childhood was hard

219
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:19,259
and parenting didn't look like
it does in other people,

220
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,662
and I'm terrified of maybe
putting someone else

221
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,533
in my position, or maybe
making a wrong decision.

222
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:30,804
And I have to weigh
these options really heavily.

223
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,926
- Today is my date with Nate.

224
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:56,396
Nate is always the most
comforting conversation.

225
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,132
I mean, him and I are
just so easy together.

226
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,969
I love the way he treats me,
and the way he looks at me,

227
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,238
and the way he sees me,
and I love being with him.

228
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,675
And knowing that he's a dad,
I feel like his daughter

229
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,479
is the luckiest girl in
the whole world to have him.

230
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:16,249
And that makes me love him
even more.

231
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,821
Just a slow walk!

232
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,356
You know, I go back and forth

233
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,493
on if I want to be a mother,
and that's something

234
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,262
that I don't quite
have figured out yet.

235
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:33,299
It just seems so complicated
and there are some

236
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,869
serious things that
we need to talk about.

237
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,004
Hi!
- Hey, what's up?

238
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,273
Oh!

239
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,709
- Mm.

240
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,815
How are you?

241
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:49,959
I'm doing really good.

242
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,551
It's so beautiful here.

243
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,253
I know.

244
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,821
- I know, have you been?

245
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,190
- Uh, yeah,
but it was during the pandemic,

246
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,501
so nothing was open.
- Oh, really?

247
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,393
- It was crickets.
It was like a ghost town.

248
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,529
- I bet that was nice,
kinda, though?

249
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,739
- Yeah, it was...
It was cool to a point...

250
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,198
- Like, to be quiet.

251
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,700
- But couldn't eat anything,
couldn't experience anything.

252
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:08,902
It's always nothing but...

253
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,304
- Like, not cool.
- Parked cars and you know.

254
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,806
Frozen water.

255
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,208
- You are so full of surprises.

256
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,343
I was like, my name
is definitely not on this card.

257
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,488
I kind of just got it out
of my mind for a little bit.

258
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,781
I was like, okay,
just gonna be chillin',

259
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,049
ready for the group date.

260
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,460
And I heard it.
My heart dropped again.

261
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,119
I was like,
you keep trying to kill me.

262
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:31,824
- Oh, my God, this is so nice.
I was like, thank God.

263
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:39,232
- You know, Nate has had
tremendous success

264
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,634
in building
his relationship so far.

265
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,238
- Gabby choosing Nate
could be just her wanting

266
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,649
to kick it with him again,
you know?

267
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,108
They do have a strong connection
and it could just

268
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,020
be, you know, I want
to spend more time with him.

269
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,948
But it also can mean, you know,
there's some important things

270
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,784
that she needs to circle
back around, touch on.

271
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,385
- You're totally right.

272
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,955
There could be some things that
she wants to address, or that

273
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:06,392
she wants to learn more about
before pulling the trigger.

274
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,404
But I think all of us guys
sitting around the table

275
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:12,065
are looking at the last rose
Nate got, thinking,

276
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,601
well, he's in a pretty good spot
I would... I would assume.

277
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,778
- Yeah, he went from
a one-on-one

278
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,704
to a group date rose.
- Yeah.

279
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,373
- You know,
to another one-on-one.

280
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,242
I think that's huge.
- Yeah.

281
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,113
- Have you been here before?

282
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,481
- No, I'm so excited!
- No?

283
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,016
Ah, me too, it's so...

284
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,818
I wanna see the tulips.

285
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,620
Are they in, like,
the actual city?

286
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,521
- I don't know.
There's, like, tulip fields.

287
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,156
I think they're everywhere.
- Okay.

288
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,792
- But they're
so beautiful and so big.

289
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,394
Oh, boy.

290
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,398
- Nate's taking care of a child.

291
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:49,502
Presumably, that's something
Gabby has thought about.

292
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:53,106
But that very well could
be something that is discussed

293
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,509
and that is, you know,
a point of conversation

294
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,978
during the one-on-one today,
you know, whether or not

295
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:02,348
she's ready to step into
a motherly role right away

296
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,350
is something that's probably...
- Sure.

297
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,985
- Part of the conversation.

298
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,954
- Dude, Nate loves his kid.

299
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,522
He talks about her all the time,

300
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,625
and I think everything
he does is for her.

301
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:15,828
So Nate's not only looking for,
you know,

302
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,172
a future partner, a future wife.

303
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,465
He's looking for
a future mother to his child.

304
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:23,603
And... and that's a huge weight
to put on Gabby as well.

305
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,439
So Gabby's got to consider
stepping into a mother role

306
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,042
right away, like you said,
and... and I think just

307
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,444
for both of them,
the decision's really tough.

308
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,313
- I really don't know
how she would react

309
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,915
to the idea of stepping
into that type of role.

310
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,617
- Yeah, I want to say
he's coming back,

311
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,952
but there's, I think,
a huge possibility

312
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,587
that he also doesn't
come back and...

313
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,855
- Yeah.

314
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,658
- Which is scary thing about,
too, you know?

315
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,193
- Yeah.

316
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,084
- You said... have you
been here before, or no?

317
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,876
- No.
- You haven't... oh, nice.

318
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,378
- No, but I'm stoked.

319
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:10,216
Nate is an amazing person,
and an amazing father.

320
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,684
I know he is.

321
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:14,821
But I have more healing
and growing to do

322
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:19,492
before I become a mom,
and my life isn't in a place

323
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,260
where I can fully commit
and take on

324
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,931
that responsibility
wholeheartedly.

325
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,204
You want to be together
so bad, but you can't.

326
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:37,777
And I don't know if I should
have done it earlier, but...

327
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,078
We're gonna sit here.

328
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,214
- Okay.

329
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,385
- This is just when
it gets so hard.

330
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,186
Nice.

331
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,201
Today has been...

332
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,826
I know.

333
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,897
I'm sorry to, like, cry
and to see you like this,

334
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:02,502
but I wanted...
There's been so much going on.

335
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,670
You're fine.
Don't be scared.

336
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,305
Um...

337
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,009
God, I don't even know
where to start.

338
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,845
I wanted today for us...

339
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,149
Is to be, like, so special,

340
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:20,720
but I have, like,
such deep feelings for you.

341
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,424
And... I know.

342
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,625
I think...
- Don't cry.

343
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,193
- No.
- It's okay.

344
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,462
Please, it's okay.

345
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:35,168
- It is gonna get harder,

346
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,571
and I never want to say goodbye,

347
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,773
but I think...

348
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:47,280
We're just at two different
places in our life.

349
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,948
- Mm-hmm.
- And...

350
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,851
It's not you, and it's me.

351
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,920
- It's not you.
- No, it is.

352
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,122
- It's not.
- And I know it's so cliché.

353
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,991
But...

354
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,762
I'm, like, terrified of...

355
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,364
of not just, like, being a mom,

356
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,867
but being, like, bad at it.

357
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:11,871
But I know I see you and I know
you're such a good dad.

358
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:14,941
And I know
she's so lucky to have you,

359
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:19,011
and really, she has to be
the luckiest girl in the world.

360
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,315
And I know, like,

361
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,218
meeting her, if... if I were to,

362
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,720
I wouldn't have a choice
but to fall in love

363
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:31,357
'cause I know how much
she's like you.

364
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,893
- Well...

365
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,529
- And I don't know
what you're thinking, or...

366
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,564
But I know every time I see you,

367
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,800
my feelings
get deeper and deeper.

368
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:44,537
And it's just so hard
'cause it's you.

369
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,732
- For one, when...
For when the time comes,

370
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,469
I know you're gonna be
a great mom.

371
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,071
- Thank you so much.

372
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:23,276
You are such a big huge
part of my journey.

373
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:28,447
I know I'm gonna
miss you so much.

374
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,450
- That's gonna be
the hardest part for me, too.

375
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,953
I'm gonna miss you a lot.

376
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,594
- I'm just sorry
that it's like...

377
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:44,664
- Don't apologize.
- I know.

378
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,433
- I don't know if I've ever
met anybody as sweet as you.

379
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,602
- Oh.
- Even now, like, I...

380
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,582
- The fact that you even think
that you have to feel sorry

381
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,242
about being like this, it's...

382
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,845
Oh.

383
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:09,956
- I would never be upset at you
for being truthful, so...

384
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,759
- No, I know,
which makes it harder.

385
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,201
- This has been
the best experience ever.

386
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,203
I'm so glad I met you.

387
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,038
I really am.

388
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,580
- I just don't want you
to regret it,

389
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,950
'cause you've made
my experience so special.

390
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:43,189
You taught me what it's like
to be treated so well.

391
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,628
I'm gonna miss you a lot.

392
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,666
Yeah.

393
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:03,242
I just know somebody's
gonna be lucky to feel like

394
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:07,713
you picked them and vice versa.

395
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,582
Just... just...

396
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,185
Just make sure you choose
somebody who picks you, okay?

397
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,954
And I know you will.

398
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,581
Give me a hug.

399
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,664
- Let's go.
- Okay.

400
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,644
Oh, God.

401
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,051
I've never experienced
what I have with Nate.

402
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:23,522
It was, like, so raw and real
and special in its own way.

403
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:29,161
I'm just so grateful for him.

404
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,731
I feel incredibly lucky
to know him.

405
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,408
I just want to be able
to go into motherhood,

406
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:45,778
you know, knowing 100%, and...

407
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:49,648
I can't say that I do
right now, but...

408
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:54,120
it just seems unfair
that it's someone

409
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:58,023
that I was maybe
falling in love with.

410
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,892
- Good luck, Gabby.
- Okay.

411
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,907
- I don't know
if I made a mistake.

412
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:21,580
I can't think clearly.

413
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,386
Even just the way

414
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:32,892
he handled everything makes me
want to be with him more.

415
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,695
It's just... it is so sick.

416
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:44,170
And it's hard
losing someone like that.

417
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,706
And it's hard knowing if
you've made a good decision.

418
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:52,378
God.

419
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,451
- This feels like
a bit of heartbreak,

420
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:05,024
a bit of confusion,
just... I don't know.

421
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,735
You know, I've never
communicated with someone

422
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,260
so easily.

423
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,931
You know, just felt a warmth
of just being around her,

424
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,700
being able to laugh and talk.

425
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,367
It's just gonna be
a hard connection that

426
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:19,271
I don't think I'll
be able to replicate.

427
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,778
Oh, man, I just remember
the first time

428
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,347
that I heard my name
on the date card.

429
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,716
I was just happy.

430
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:34,220
And then just seeing it end
in front of me, just, like,

431
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:37,923
our entire relationship
from the start,

432
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,726
what was inevitably the finish
was just hard

433
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:43,562
to accept that it was over.

434
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,736
- Oh, dude.

435
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:51,923
- Nate's gone.
- Nate's gone.

436
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,639
- Wait, what?

437
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,274
- Wow.

438
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:57,943
- That's crazy, man.
He was a good guy.

439
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,514
- I knew, like, coming in,

440
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,021
it was gonna be a little hard
for me,

441
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,619
but tried to stay positive

442
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:10,189
and just keep pushing,
but it didn't work out.

443
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,802
You can't just switch off
emotions and feelings.

444
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,473
I'm still, you know,
falling for her, but...

445
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,943
It's just sad it's over.

446
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:50,529
It's hard
losing someone like Nate.

447
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:55,401
Just seems too early and
too late all at the same time.

448
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,941
And it's hard knowing
if you've made a good decision.

449
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:08,280
And so right now,

450
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:11,784
it just hurts.

451
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:27,967
- Today, I have a really
fun day planned with Zach.

452
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:31,804
This is a once in a lifetime
bucket list date.

453
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,707
I mean, these tulips are
only in bloom for two weeks,

454
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:39,478
and I've never seen anything
like this in my entire life.

455
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,191
The Netherlands
are so beautiful.

456
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,126
Being in this field is

457
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:57,229
just absolutely crazy
that I'm here!

458
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:59,131
Hey!

459
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,199
- Come here, beautiful.

460
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,334
- Hi, how are you?
- Oh.

461
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,407
Wow.

462
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:11,110
Hello.
- Hi.

463
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,646
I'm so excited to be able
to spend some time with Zach.

464
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,216
Welcome to The Netherlands.

465
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:20,452
I really just know
Zach and I will pick up

466
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,854
right where we left off.

467
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,455
Are you excited?
- Oh, I'm so excited.

468
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,966
Look at how beautiful this is.
- I know!

469
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,793
We'll go this way.
- Yeah, lead me.

470
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,961
- Isn't this so pretty?

471
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,863
We can pick
the tulips here, too.

472
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:31,997
- We can?
- Mm-hmm.

473
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,699
- What's your favorite color
so far?

474
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:34,967
- I really like the red ones,

475
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,069
but look at how beautiful
these are.

476
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:39,471
Zach always makes me feel great

477
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,808
and seen and really special.

478
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,576
Will you accept this tulip?

479
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,146
- I would love to.

480
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,680
My pleasure.

481
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,682
We have a playful,
great relationship.

482
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,751
We have a lot of chemistry.

483
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:56,221
Ooh, so handsome!

484
00:25:56,288 --> 00:26:00,192
Zach is so in touch
with his emotions.

485
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,527
- Three, two.

486
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:02,528
Beautiful.

487
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,630
- But he still can have fun.

488
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:05,764
We can be goofy.

489
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,075
- Can't wait
to look at these later.

490
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,634
- Oh, you think
you're keeping them?

491
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,402
- Oh, yeah, you think you are?

492
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:11,870
No shot.

493
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,705
- I think Zach just really has

494
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,974
all the qualities you could
want in a partner.

495
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,043
- Little selfie right here.

496
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,281
- And I'm just really excited
to spend the day with him.

497
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,792
- I know today's
gonna be magical.

498
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,260
- Magical.

499
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,371
- I think magical is the word.

500
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:37,629
- Whoo!

501
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,631
- Where I am with Rachel,
I think is,

502
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,509
you know, the strongest
it can be at this point.

503
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,602
- Do you think I could
stand up on the seat?

504
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:44,603
- You're actually trying it.

505
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,038
No, no, no, no.

506
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,107
I feel like I'm on the top
of the world right now.

507
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,333
I mean, I could see my future
with her without a doubt.

508
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,177
- Do you want to stop here?

509
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,946
- Uh, yeah.

510
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,448
So getting the second
one-on-one date

511
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:59,084
means that I think she's maybe
thinking the same thing.

512
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:00,528
- Would you like to have
some cheese, maybe, or...

513
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,787
- Yes, I would.
- Yeah?

514
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:03,989
It's... in Dutch,
it's brandnetel kaas.

515
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:06,024
It's nettle cheese.

516
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,760
- Ever since Rachel and I's
first one-on-one date in LA,

517
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:09,904
every time
we've been together...

518
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,264
- Well, these are
wooden shoes, clogs.

519
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,765
Ooh.

520
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:14,967
- Yes!

521
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,835
- Every time
we've laughed and joked

522
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:18,604
and hung out together...

523
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,115
- Oh, my gosh,
they look so good on you.

524
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,207
- It's just gotten better
and better and better.

525
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,976
- We're not in LA anymore.

526
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,177
- No, we are not.

527
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:26,244
- Hello.
- Hello.

528
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:31,617
- As cliché as it sounds,
the sky's the limit.

529
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,852
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

530
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,254
How do you say cheers in Dutch?

531
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,355
Proost.

532
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:37,523
- Proost.

533
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,058
- Ooh!
- Proost.

534
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,194
- Oh, my gosh.

535
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,562
This is so beautiful.

536
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:44,749
- Let's buy a windmill, huh?

537
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:48,066
Rachel is everything
I've ever wanted.

538
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,336
She still gives me butterflies.

539
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:55,807
She's absolutely stunning,
she's so fun, she's so kind.

540
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,643
And from moment one with her,

541
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,077
she's made me feel comfortable.

542
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,480
- Oh, my gosh!
- What?

543
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:04,316
After the culmination
of dates we've had

544
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:07,452
and group dates
and cocktail parties

545
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,888
and getting to know her more,
it's also crazy

546
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:12,524
to say I think I may be
falling in love with her.

547
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,129
This is actually, like,
the best day.

548
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,540
And I didn't think
the last one-on-one,

549
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:19,898
you know,
could be topped, but...

550
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,833
Like, getting this
second opportunity,

551
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,535
like, on another one-on-one.

552
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:26,205
Like, obviously so excited...
- Mm-hmm.

553
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,907
- But like, just how
our first date went,

554
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:31,944
and how every time
we spent together, like,

555
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,812
it was just an absolute blast.

556
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,281
And I feel like it got better
and better and more fun.

557
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:37,282
And we laughed more
and we just...

558
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:38,650
- Mm-hmm.

559
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,852
- Like, just joked about
the silliest, dumbest things.

560
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,854
- I know.
- And that's what I love.

561
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:46,225
And that's how I know, you know,

562
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,126
that, you know, there's
something here, yeah.

563
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,628
- Yeah.

564
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:52,731
- You, like, looking forward
to the craziness

565
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,000
of, like, what a Hometown
can look like?

566
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,535
Yeah, I am.

567
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:57,769
Are you?

568
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,772
How are you feeling
about all that?

569
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,308
- I mean,
to be completely honest...

570
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,543
- Mm-hmm.

571
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,578
- You could meet them now...

572
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,647
- Right now?
- For all I could care, yeah.

573
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:10,749
Like, I'm that,
you know, confident...

574
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:13,051
- Yeah.
- And, like, sure

575
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,478
that you would
absolutely love them

576
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,255
and they'll absolutely love you.

577
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:27,332
- Zach has truly just
continued to impress me.

578
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,234
I would be honored

579
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:30,669
to meet the people
that raised him

580
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:33,238
because he is just
such an upstanding guy.

581
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:37,643
I'll never forget this
my entire life.

582
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,379
I mean,
I'm in a field of tulips,

583
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,681
I'm in Holland,

584
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:44,516
and I have an incredible guy
with me,

585
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,252
and I'm so just excited
for tonight,

586
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:52,190
and this really feels like
I'm in a fairy tale.

587
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:55,327
This is so incredible!

588
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:57,229
How is this real?

589
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,745
- Today was incredible.

590
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,081
We rode bikes
through the countryside,

591
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,550
smelled the tulips.

592
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,385
It was pretty romantic.

593
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,556
Oh.
- Oh, my God.

594
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:28,760
And now, this is
an actual pinch-me moment.

595
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:32,497
I am in Amsterdam at
a beautiful museum right now

596
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,666
with beautiful Rachel.

597
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:37,235
- Oh, my...

598
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:40,605
- This is incredible.

599
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,277
I feel a lot of things
for Rachel.

600
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,412
But mainly, I feel like

601
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,614
I'm the luckiest guy right now.

602
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,017
The rose tonight
means Hometowns.

603
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:55,253
And if things
continue to go well,

604
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,522
Rachel will end up
meeting the family.

605
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,859
And the fact that that's
a possibility is mind blowing.

606
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:03,495
- Hello!
- This is amazing.

607
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:05,764
- I'm feeling excited, but also

608
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:11,036
scared, nervous, anxious,
all of the above

609
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,847
for when I'm going
to tell Rachel how I feel.

610
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,706
Today was...

611
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:17,175
- Bucket list.
- Absolute bucket list.

612
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:20,612
I mean, you've been checking off
all the boxes

613
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,180
since the moment I met you.

614
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:27,219
And I haven't had any doubts
about you meeting my family

615
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,555
'cause not many people have.

616
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,157
Because this is
a very scary thing.

617
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,658
- Yeah.
- You know, like, really...

618
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,993
- No, I...
- Finding one...

619
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,728
- I know.
- Yeah.

620
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,930
- There's no one
that understands more.

621
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,532
- Right.
- Like, I get it.

622
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,534
But have you ever
brought someone home

623
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:43,969
to meet your family?

624
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,304
- Yeah, well, I... in my life,

625
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:47,648
I've had about
two serious relationships.

626
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,074
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, one...

627
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,251
One in high school, you know,

628
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,778
the typical
high school sweetheart,

629
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:56,815
and then one that ended about
a little over a year ago.

630
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:00,652
- Right, I remember that one.
- And that was actually where

631
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:03,955
things kind of took a turn
in my life, actually,

632
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:07,492
where I wasn't okay.

633
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,762
So I... I wanted to talk to you
about this, because...

634
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:12,330
- Yeah, to see
what you mean by that.

635
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:16,101
- It's... it's really important to
kind of the man I am today.

636
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:18,437
- Yeah.

637
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:22,207
- About a couple of years ago,
I was about 85 pounds

638
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,475
more than I am now.

639
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:26,378
Severely overweight.

640
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:30,315
I've realized that
I was not happy,

641
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,651
and I didn't have anything
that resembled,

642
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,252
like, love for myself.

643
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,656
So when I was trying
to seek that in others,

644
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,066
I couldn't find it,
even if it would...

645
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,159
Maybe it was right in my face.

646
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:42,894
Couldn't do it, so,

647
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:47,132
I needed to make sure
that I myself became whole

648
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:50,268
and figured out what was
the problem, how do I fix it.

649
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,571
And then once I'm whole,

650
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,215
I want to share that love
with someone...

651
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,941
- Yeah.
- When I'm there for them

652
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,410
and not make those mistakes.

653
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,913
- What did you do, like,
to work on yourself?

654
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,115
Like, what were
the steps you took...

655
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,384
- Yeah.
- Like, to get there

656
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,186
to where you are?
- Yeah.

657
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:11,189
The main thing that really did,
like, help me in all this,

658
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,658
and I... you know,

659
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,127
a huge proponent of it...
Therapy.

660
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:19,331
- I was about to say
'cause I could not agree more.

661
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:22,400
I'm very, like,
excited that you said that.

662
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,169
- Yeah.
- I feel like it really

663
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:27,339
helps you, like, get
to the bottom of everything.

664
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,140
- Yeah.
- Like, especially after

665
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,877
coming off of,
like, Clayton's season,

666
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,180
going to therapy was
my favorite part of the week.

667
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,482
I really feel like I got to,

668
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,451
like, make the outline
for myself

669
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,520
and, like, how am I
going to move forward

670
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,989
and what do I like, and...
- Yeah.

671
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,191
- I just...
I truly love it so much.

672
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:49,561
So I'm so happy that
you also are a man...

673
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:50,638
- Isn't it incredible?
- It's amazing.

674
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:52,397
- Like, how it can
just do wonders?

675
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:53,632
- Yeah.
- Are you still gonna,

676
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,742
like, continue it...
Are you still gonna...

677
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:55,834
- Oh, my gosh, yeah.

678
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,335
When you, I think,
really sit down

679
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:00,071
and, like, think about what
you want, things come to you.

680
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,840
- Yeah.
- And I'm really happy

681
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:03,074
you're in front of me.
- Yeah.

682
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,809
- And that you're sharing
all this with me

683
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:09,981
and your struggle because you
are seriously so incredible.

684
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,451
And you are so deserving of love

685
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,654
and I just want you
to know that.

686
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,323
- Oh, wow,
that's very sweet of you to say.

687
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,592
And I actually did want to,
you know...

688
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,893
You know, tell you something.

689
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,729
- Yeah.

690
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,966
- You know, I can say now
as a man with confidence,

691
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:31,770
you know,
I am falling in love with you.

692
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,371
And it's...

693
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,907
It's crazy to say, but...

694
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:38,910
I'm falling in love with you,
and...

695
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:40,645
Oh, my gosh.

696
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,596
Oh, my gosh,
I feel like my heart

697
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,106
is just, like,
beating so fast right now.

698
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,765
My... mine too.

699
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,101
Whew, I said it out loud.

700
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:05,470
I said it out loud.

701
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,042
- Tonight, Zach tells me
he's falling in love with me.

702
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,878
Oh, my gosh, this is really
working, and this is happening.

703
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,080
And to hear it from Zach,

704
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,282
especially after
the most incredible day,

705
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,351
it's really the best way
to end it.

706
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:24,089
And I just feel so happy,
and I feel, like,

707
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,424
just ecstatic.

708
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:30,662
It's not a tulip.

709
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:33,398
Not a tulip.

710
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,467
- Zach,

711
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,470
getting to hear more
of what made you you,

712
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,006
I just feel really honored
to know you.

713
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:44,509
And I feel really lucky
to have you here.

714
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:49,514
But most of all,
I am so confident that

715
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:53,318
I would love to meet your
family, if you would have me.

716
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:56,154
So with that being said,

717
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:59,791
Zach, will you accept this rose?

718
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,393
- More than anything
in the world.

719
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,171
- I'm feeling like
I'm on cloud nine,

720
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:15,407
being on this journey
and meeting Rachel

721
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,376
and having
these experiences with her,

722
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,078
I couldn't be happier.

723
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:21,346
- Okay, are you ready?

724
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:24,082
- I'm ready, let's go.

725
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:27,052
I think my family
is going to adore Rachel.

726
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:30,622
She's compassionate
and sweet and thoughtful,

727
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,758
which is something
I've always looked for,

728
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:38,396
and something that my family
does want for me.

729
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:40,131
After tonight,

730
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:45,236
engagement feels and seems like
a very, very real possibility.

731
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,773
What is that?

732
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,308
- What?

733
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,017
No way.

734
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,988
- I definitely feel like tonight

735
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,624
has brought Zach and I
closer together.

736
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,594
This is so amazing.

737
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:14,499
I see so much potential
for Zach and I in the future.

738
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,902
I think that we have such
a playful relationship,

739
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,840
but we do still have
those serious

740
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,475
and vulnerable conversations,

741
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:27,145
and we're able to be emotional
with each other and open up.

742
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:31,282
After everything he's told me
and the most amazing day,

743
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:34,385
it was just so perfect.

744
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,462
- Nate is such a good dude.

745
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:46,574
- That was obviously a tough
thing that happened today.

746
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,067
And I'm... I'm sure she's going
through it right now, so...

747
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,776
- I'm sure she won't be able
to just wipe this away,

748
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:55,840
whatever happened.

749
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:58,676
- At the end of the day, like,
she needs our support,

750
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,263
especially after
a hard day like today.

751
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:03,114
I can't imagine what
that must have been like.

752
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,355
- Oh, Gabby.

753
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,158
Hi.

754
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,602
- Want to sit down?
- Oh, thank you.

755
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,927
- Yeah.

756
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,098
- What's up?

757
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:22,400
- Um...
- You all right?

758
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,836
- I think you guys know, like...

759
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:27,572
um...

760
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,508
I... Nate isn't here.

761
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:33,211
Um...

762
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:35,313
I think, like,

763
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,684
at some point, you know, things
get really real, obviously.

764
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:42,420
And I had to be honest
with both of us

765
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:46,224
and that I'm just not
at a point in my life

766
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:51,462
where I could maybe assume the
responsibility of being a mom.

767
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,565
And...

768
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,267
I don't... like, it's hard.

769
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,204
'Cause it's not something
you can really control and...

770
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,606
Sorry, you guys are, like,
probably really freaked out.

771
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,408
- No, not at all.
It's tough.

772
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:05,343
We've been thinking
about you all day.

773
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,188
All day, we were just, like,
can we give her a hug

774
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:10,215
and just be there for her,
'cause we knew.

775
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,059
You made me emotional.
This is... this is tough.

776
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,751
This is, like,
really hard, so...

777
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,019
- Thank you.

778
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:21,826
I want you guys to know
everything, you know?

779
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,761
I wanted you to, like,
hear it from me now

780
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:26,030
'cause I didn't want
you guys to wonder.

781
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,365
- Can I give you a hug?

782
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,609
- Yeah, can we hug you?
- Yeah.

783
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:30,535
Can we give you some hugs?

784
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:32,203
Thank you.

785
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,839
- Sorry.

786
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:37,242
- Today for me was the realest,

787
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,177
rawest day that I've had.

788
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:41,312
Thank you.
- Of course, Gabby.

789
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,616
- I was so scared of how
the men would react,

790
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:48,553
but they were all
really understanding.

791
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,388
Thank you.
- For sure.

792
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:53,558
- I think today's pivotal,

793
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,327
and it's hard as hell,

794
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:00,031
but making these big decisions

795
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:04,235
will eventually lead
to finding my partner.

796
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:05,670
I'll see you guys soon.

797
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,205
- Later, Gabby.
- Bye, Gabby.

798
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:08,773
- Bye.
- Good night.

799
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:23,488
- This morning,
I woke up really sad.

800
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:27,692
Just thinking about Nate, I...
I wasn't ready to say goodbye.

801
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:31,229
But I know that
our fundamental lives

802
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:36,301
are different at this moment,
and that can't change.

803
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,403
The men have been
really supportive

804
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:41,372
of my hard time with Nate.

805
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:46,277
And they were all
really understanding.

806
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:48,880
It makes me feel
really comfortable

807
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,782
and really confident
moving forward,

808
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:54,786
and potentially
meeting their families.

809
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,722
My connections
are deepening so fast,

810
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:02,126
and I feel positive
and so hopeful for the future.

811
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:05,563
And I think today is going to be

812
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,733
so amazing and so fun.

813
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,139
Gabby!

814
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,617
Gabby!
- What is this... you got this

815
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:17,751
kind of, like,
this kind of thing going on?

816
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,111
Are we running?

817
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:22,880
- I haven't been on a group
date with Gabby's bunch.

818
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:26,551
So today, I'm gonna be myself
and let my personality

819
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,787
shine through and go home
with a rose, hopefully.

820
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,155
- Gabby, what's going on today?

821
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,458
- That's for me to know
and you to find out.

822
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,927
Come on, give mama a hug.

823
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:39,797
My greatest hope
for today is to get

824
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,265
more comfortable with each other

825
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,034
physically and emotionally.

826
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:45,336
And I'm excited
to deepen our connections

827
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:46,971
to see where things go.

828
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,707
We do have
an incredible day planned.

829
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:50,942
It's gonna be crazy,

830
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,444
just like everything else.

831
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,215
Just lean in as much
as you're comfortable, truly.

832
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,850
So should we go in?

833
00:41:58,916 --> 00:41:59,851
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's do it.

834
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,252
- Yes.
- Let's do it.

835
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:02,896
- The date card says,
"Let's take our love

836
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,855
to the edge."

837
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,189
The edge of what?

838
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,625
They'll have to find out.

839
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:12,163
Ha ha!

840
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,532
Oh, my God!

841
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,734
Yo, I can't!

842
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:20,104
- We open the door,
there's this woman.

843
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:21,548
She's there with
the slicked-back hair,

844
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,150
the tight leather outfit,
and she's, like,

845
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:24,275
not messing around at all.

846
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:25,943
- I don't know if I'm aroused

847
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,845
or if I'm just, like, scared.

848
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:30,048
- I think all of us were,
like, oh, my God,

849
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,625
what the hell are we
getting ourselves into?

850
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:32,750
- Hi, guys.

851
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:35,420
I'm here to whip you guys
in shape.

852
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,654
Oh.

853
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,090
People all around the world,

854
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:41,826
they come to Amsterdam
to explore their fantasies,

855
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,528
to be open-minded,

856
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,130
to do some maybe dirty things.

857
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:50,735
So I am here to help you guys

858
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:52,570
to communicate with Gabby,

859
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:56,140
and to explore things
you can do with each other

860
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:59,510
because sex is so important
in a relationship.

861
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,946
- Today,
we're going to talk about

862
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:03,915
,

863
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,217
Knocking boots,

864
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:07,284
,

865
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,387
Hanky panky...

866
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:11,456
Also known as sex.

867
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,558
- How many of you

868
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:16,861
know how to treat a woman
in the bedroom?

869
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,696
Uh...

870
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,364
Yeah.

871
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,608
- I feel like I did,
but now I don't... I don't know.

872
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,101
- Yeah,
I'm kind of questioning...

873
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,936
There's no whips, usually.

874
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:27,405
- So I helped a lot of couples

875
00:43:27,472 --> 00:43:30,975
to find out their boundaries,
their sexual desires,

876
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:35,146
and what's very important
is your safe word.

877
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:39,817
So now you have to figure out
what your safe word is.

878
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,356
- Um, pumpkin.

879
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:46,357
- Pumpkin?
- Pumpkin.

880
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:48,159
- Okay.
- Cruise ship.

881
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:49,360
Cruise ship.

882
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:51,796
- Um, uh, Albuquerque.

883
00:43:51,863 --> 00:43:53,030
What?

884
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,098
That fits you well.

885
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:55,342
- You can't really
confuse that word

886
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:56,410
with any other word, right?

887
00:43:56,434 --> 00:43:58,402
- How about, like, asbestos?

888
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,904
Or something like that.

889
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,573
My safe word was asbestos.

890
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,342
It's a toxic chemical.

891
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,945
It's just unwanted,
especially in the bedroom.

892
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,248
- I have some very nice
questions for you guys.

893
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,549
Oh, my God.

894
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:13,184
- And don't lie to me.

895
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:16,687
If you do lie to me,
I bring this.

896
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,956
Uh-oh.

897
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:22,460
Jason, do you enjoy giving?

898
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:24,428
Oh, my God.

899
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,265
- This is not what I was
expecting we were gonna do.

900
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,467
Honestly,
one of my worst nightmares.

901
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:30,601
I'm not answering this.

902
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,136
Ah, why not?

903
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:33,838
- I'll talk to Gabby personally.

904
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:35,439
- I think that's a yes.

905
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,841
- Oh, okay.

906
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:38,176
Erich?

907
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:39,443
Hello, Erich?

908
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,513
- Erich!

909
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,315
I have a question for you.
- Hi.

910
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:47,118
- How often... and be honest...

911
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,720
Do you?

912
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,107
- Susie comes in first
with, like,

913
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,323
the really hard questions,

914
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:53,934
things that we're
standing there being, like,

915
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,694
uh, I don't know
how to answer this.

916
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:57,762
- So you have to answer.

917
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,430
Otherwise,
I'm gonna use my whip.

918
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:01,899
- Use it.
- It's gonna be very hard.

919
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:03,067
- Do your worst.

920
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,270
- Susie's got a very quick whip.

921
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:10,374
And she's also very, uh,
pressuring with the questions.

922
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:15,713
- Johnny, have you slept
with more than ten women?

923
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,780
- Um...

924
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:19,483
Do you know who I am?

925
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:23,854
I'm from Palm Beach, Florida.

926
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:26,490
- Is it more than ten?

927
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,491
20?

928
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,795
- 20? Um...
- 30?

929
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:31,861
Hmm?

930
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:32,997
Hundreds?

931
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:37,034
Pumpkin.

932
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:40,137
- This next exercise
will maybe even trigger

933
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:43,341
your flight or fight response.

934
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,309
Johnny.

935
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:49,780
I feel like the guys came in
nervous, naturally,

936
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:53,451
but I knew Johnny was
gonna be great today.

937
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:54,917
- Do you want my clothes off,
Susie?

938
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:55,886
- Yes.
- Is that what you want?

939
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:56,988
- I would love that.

940
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:59,390
- He's been hilarious.
He's leaning in.

941
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:01,092
Whoo-hoo!
- Oh!

942
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:03,094
- Whoa, Johnny.

943
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,796
- I think he's really
comfortable with himself...

944
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:07,131
- Stop.
- No!

945
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:09,700
And this situation,
so I appreciate that

946
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,936
he's kind of, like, leading
the way for all the guys.

947
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:14,438
- Don't do it.
This is my nightmare!

948
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,207
Stop!

949
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,541
- Are your feet ticklish?

950
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,986
- Okay, a little bit ticklish!
- Yes, you are!

951
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,945
- All right,
all right, all right, stop.

952
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:23,381
- Why are there
so many distance?

953
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,650
- 'Cause I was... I was doing
a slow approach, right?

954
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:26,927
- Ah, okay, okay.
- I was making it more...

955
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,452
Just building up the suspense.

956
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,722
Okay, you're gonna build up.

957
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,324
- Are you afraid of her?

958
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:36,727
- Albuquerque.
- It's a good safe word, right?

959
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:40,264
- Spencer is a very
diligent army guy.

960
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:42,933
- Lower it.
- , just give it to me.

961
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,369
- We're definitely not
in his natural element,

962
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:46,437
I'll tell you that.

963
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:48,973
Oh, my God,
what did we sign up for?

964
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,045
- Take off your shirts
and take a seat on the ground.

965
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,813
Have some little stripping.

966
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,783
Make yourself comfortable.

967
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:02,019
- Was kind of hoping
today would be

968
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:06,624
a deep dive into who we are
and what we represent.

969
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:08,726
And I'm just kind of blindfolded

970
00:47:08,793 --> 00:47:11,128
laying on a shag carpet
waiting for her

971
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,331
to rub whipped cream
on my nipples.

972
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,939
Sexually, I am extremely open.

973
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,175
My motto is
I'll try anything twice.

974
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:27,178
Way harder.

975
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:28,579
Go harder.

976
00:47:28,646 --> 00:47:30,348
Ah!

977
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,552
Oh!

978
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,020
- Oh, what?

979
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:38,127
I feel like I went all out,
and that's all I can do.

980
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,390
- Johnny, what happened?

981
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:47,398
- Today for me
was just what I needed.

982
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:48,966
Dude.

983
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:50,968
This is a first.
- Who's ticklish?

984
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,871
I think we all put ourselves
out of our comfort zone.

985
00:47:53,938 --> 00:47:56,140
- Is this shaving cream
or whipped cream?

986
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,709
- They've all blown me
out of the water

987
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:00,144
and truly impressed me.

988
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:02,847
And I'm excited
with the potential

989
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,883
of handing out
a Hometown rose tonight.

990
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,018
You guys did great.
- Yeah, thank you.

991
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:25,236
- The group date was...

992
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,405
It was interesting,
definitely had some fun.

993
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,516
We just got to laugh and get
to know each other better.

994
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,642
And I think Gabby had fun,
so that's what matters.

995
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:33,220
I definitely want
to talk to Gabby about,

996
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,079
like, Hometowns and all
those things tonight.

997
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:36,914
I'm really looking forward
to it, honestly.

998
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:39,483
- Cheers, boys.
Who knows what's gonna happen?

999
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,619
- Yes.
Cheers.

1000
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,754
- To whatever happens.

1001
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:46,390
- Cheers.
- We had a crazy group date.

1002
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:49,193
Now tonight,
we have a cocktail party.

1003
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,996
I feel like I did enough
at the group date.

1004
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,273
I feel like I kind of
was the only one

1005
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:54,432
who put myself out there.

1006
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:56,467
But the mood is tense

1007
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:57,802
'cause it's my last chance

1008
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:59,336
to talk to Gabby
before Hometowns.

1009
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:00,704
Oh, God.

1010
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:09,046
- So, Logan?

1011
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:11,215
- Yeah, what the?
- Logan just isn't here?

1012
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,451
- Like, is he sleeping?

1013
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,753
- Something's up.

1014
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,131
- Hey.
- Hi.

1015
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:28,599
- I'm sorry to pop up
unannounced.

1016
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,100
- Yeah.
- You got a second to chat?

1017
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,502
- Sure.
- Okay.

1018
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:33,046
- You mind if I come in?
- Not at all.

1019
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,439
- Thank you.

1020
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,548
Um, I know you're really
excited about tonight.

1021
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:46,217
- Mm-hmm.
- But we do have

1022
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:49,386
a bit of a situation
with one of your guys.

1023
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:53,424
Logan tested positive
for COVID-19.

1024
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,025
Oh.

1025
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:56,827
- He's doing fine.

1026
00:49:56,894 --> 00:49:59,230
But because we're trying
to take a real abundance

1027
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:02,299
of caution for yourself,
for the rest of the guys,

1028
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:05,503
we have to cancel
tonight's cocktail party.

1029
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,749
I know how important it was
and how much

1030
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,876
you were looking forward to it
with, obviously,

1031
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,879
Hometowns on the horizon.

1032
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:16,514
You doing okay?

1033
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,415
- I was really looking
forward to tonight,

1034
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:21,418
but I feel for Logan.

1035
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:25,456
I obviously hope that
he is feeling okay.

1036
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:28,792
And I hope he knows that we're
all wishing the best for him

1037
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,661
and want him to get better fast.

1038
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:31,829
- Yeah.

1039
00:50:31,896 --> 00:50:33,631
All right,
I'm gonna go tell the guys.

1040
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,299
Again, I am so, so sorry.

1041
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,770
- Yeah, me too.

1042
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:40,871
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1043
00:50:40,938 --> 00:50:42,115
- Get some sleep.
- Okay, thank you.

1044
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,607
- Get some rest.
See you.

1045
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:45,876
- Okay.

1046
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:47,545
I feel terrible for Logan.

1047
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:51,582
But mainly, I want his health
and his safety to be okay.

1048
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:56,220
But I also truly feel bad
for the other guys.

1049
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:59,723
There's a rose on the table
tonight, so I'm sure that

1050
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:03,594
the guys are probably
going to be really shocked.

1051
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:06,897
- It's Logan.

1052
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:07,965
- Oh, it's Jesse.

1053
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:10,601
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

1054
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:14,371
My heart is beating
out of my chest.

1055
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:15,639
- Gentlemen.

1056
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:19,043
- Jesse.
- How we doing?

1057
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,711
- Relatively okay.
- We'll see.

1058
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:22,155
- I did have to come
and share some news

1059
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,214
with you all about tonight.

1060
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:27,985
As you can probably tell
by now, Logan's not here.

1061
00:51:28,052 --> 00:51:33,123
There has been
a situation with Logan.

1062
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:37,895
And because of that,
there is no after party.

1063
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:39,202
- Can you tell us if he's okay?

1064
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,198
- Logan's doing his... yeah,
Logan's doing okay.

1065
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:42,266
- Okay.

1066
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:43,968
- I know how bad
you needed this tonight.

1067
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:46,103
Hometowns are on the horizon.

1068
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,806
But my advice to you all is to
get some sleep and hopefully,

1069
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:52,843
tomorrow you'll get that time
with Gabby that you need.

1070
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,311
Good night, fellas.

1071
00:51:54,378 --> 00:51:56,780
- Good night, Jesse.
- See you, Jesse.

1072
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,787
- Dude.

1073
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:08,926
- I'm feeling really sad.

1074
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:10,761
I have four men left.

1075
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:13,464
And I really,
really needed tonight

1076
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:18,102
to help me figure out
who was going to Hometowns.

1077
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:20,004
It's kind of a pit
in my stomach, you know,

1078
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,505
that I have to make
this decision.

1079
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,743
I'm not sure if I'm in a place
where I can confidently

1080
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,879
give out a Hometown rose
to all the guys.

1081
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:31,715
Well, that was weird.

1082
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:35,252
- Wish we got
to see Gabby tonight.

1083
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,021
I think I was one
of those people

1084
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,789
who really needed that time.

1085
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,667
- Yeah, there's definitely some
things I wanted to say tonight.

1086
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:42,660
- Yeah.
- It sucks.

1087
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,962
- I want it
to be the right person.

1088
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:48,399
And I think these next couple
weeks are extremely pivotal.

1089
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:50,534
And this is where I really
get to know them.

1090
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:52,102
Every second counts.

1091
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,938
I do want someone
who's ready to propose,

1092
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,974
and now a matter of weeks.

1093
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,278
This is actually really scary

1094
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:05,282
for the future.

1095
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:13,991
- Let's get it.
- Whoa-ho-ho!

1096
00:53:14,058 --> 00:53:15,759
- This is so cool.
- Look at this.

1097
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:17,828
- You see that?
- Beautiful.

1098
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:19,263
- I'm excited.

1099
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:20,731
Can't wait to see Rachel.

1100
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:23,300
Just being with her is...
Is the exciting part, so...

1101
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:28,238
- Hi, guys.

1102
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,642
- Rachel looks
absolutely stunning.

1103
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,444
There's only four guys,
so hopefully

1104
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,345
I get ample time to shine.

1105
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:37,614
Every time I see her,
I, like, want to take her home.

1106
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:40,150
- You look gorgeous. Hi.
- Hi. Thank you.

1107
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,795
- The Date Card said,
"I'm looking for someone

1108
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:43,087
who melts my heart."

1109
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:45,389
No idea what that's going to be,

1110
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:47,558
but at the end of the day,
Rachel,

1111
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:50,227
I'm going to melt your heart.

1112
00:53:50,294 --> 00:53:52,863
- Welcome to the town of Edam.

1113
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:56,200
This town is the cheese capital
of the world.

1114
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:58,469
So what do you guys say?

1115
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:00,213
Should we explore the town
and have a little fun?

1116
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,347
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

1117
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:02,506
- You guys ready?
- Yeah.

1118
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,007
- Let's do it.
- Okay, let's go.

1119
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:09,947
- Oh, cheese wheels.
- Here we go!

1120
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,348
- You guys like cheese, right?

1121
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,250
- I do like cheese.
- I love cheese.

1122
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:17,121
We are in this
magical town of Edam.

1123
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,989
It's the cheese capital
of the world.

1124
00:54:19,056 --> 00:54:20,656
Should we try some?
- What is that thing?

1125
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:22,459
- Oh, there's a lot of cheese.

1126
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:24,328
- Black lemon?
- Start us off.

1127
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:26,163
- Where, uh, where from...

1128
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,164
- Damn.
- Yeah?

1129
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:28,465
- It's like a baby.

1130
00:54:28,532 --> 00:54:30,200
- As silly and as fun

1131
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,035
as this last group date
is going to be,

1132
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,938
it does hold a lot of meaning
for me because

1133
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:37,141
there is a rose
at the end of today,

1134
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:40,444
and this rose
guarantees a Hometown.

1135
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:45,349
And one little conversation
could get someone there or not.

1136
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,417
- Want to go over there
and see the water?

1137
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,419
- Oh, can we?
- Yeah, I think so.

1138
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:50,854
You want to?
- Heck yeah.

1139
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:53,023
- Okay.

1140
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,892
How are you?
- I'm good, how are you?

1141
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,160
- I'm good, I missed you.

1142
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,428
At this point, you know,

1143
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,198
we're all in deep with Rachel,
you know?

1144
00:55:01,265 --> 00:55:04,868
We have real feelings
that are legit.

1145
00:55:04,935 --> 00:55:06,837
- You looking forward
to next week?

1146
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:08,705
- Are you?
- I am, actually.

1147
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,140
Oh!

1148
00:55:10,207 --> 00:55:12,476
- Hopefully.
- I do see my life

1149
00:55:12,543 --> 00:55:14,678
with Rachel outside of this.

1150
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:17,281
And with Hometowns
right around the corner,

1151
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:19,492
you just have to take in the
moment right then and there.

1152
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,485
I can't let this one get away,
you know?

1153
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:23,020
- Mm-hmm.
- Right back to it.

1154
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,354
Oh, there he goes, smooth.

1155
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,858
- Can I steal her now, please?

1156
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:29,393
- Absolutely.
- I'm sorry.

1157
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,361
- Damn.
- Well played.

1158
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:32,729
- This is cutthroat.

1159
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:34,164
- I know, it is.

1160
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:36,266
- I need to really
go for it today.

1161
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,102
And I'm here to find out
if this is my girl.

1162
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,904
I don't want to leave
anything up to chance.

1163
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:43,707
- How are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.

1164
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:44,708
Way better
now that I'm with you.

1165
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:46,176
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1166
00:55:46,243 --> 00:55:48,645
With Rachel, I just, like,
want her to always know, like,

1167
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:50,714
with me, she's gonna
always have effort.

1168
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:52,616
I like talking to you, too.
- Mm.

1169
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:54,251
We can talk later.

1170
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:56,920
- Rachel is very worth
fighting for.

1171
00:55:56,987 --> 00:56:00,290
I like her, I want to show her
in every way I can

1172
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,292
I'm here,
I'm ready to give it my all.

1173
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:05,796
- Hello, welcome everybody here
on the Cheese Market in Edam.

1174
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:10,167
We have a competition to be
the strongest man in Edam.

1175
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:13,937
It is a tradition which we
have done for many years now.

1176
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:15,105
- Go, go, go!

1177
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:17,407
You guys are strong.

1178
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:20,677
- I'm really, really hoping to
introduce Rachel to my family.

1179
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:23,614
So I'm willing to give
everything I can to it.

1180
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,482
It's like, you know what?
Why not?

1181
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:26,583
- They're really strong!

1182
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,518
They're really strong,
all of them.

1183
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,254
- You know,
I'm pretty lactose intolerant,

1184
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,024
so we're getting cheesy today.

1185
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:36,026
You know, might be feeling it
a little later.

1186
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:41,031
But Rachel loves cheese,
so therefore, I love cheese.

1187
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:47,204
- Um, if you guys want
to take off your shirts,

1188
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:49,640
you can.

1189
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:56,680
This is definitely
my favorite group date so far.

1190
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,983
I want a strong man,
and I have four today.

1191
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,285
- Man.
- Do you need sunscreen?

1192
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:02,519
- I mean...

1193
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:04,354
- The guys,
they look really good.

1194
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,157
Their glistening abs are out.

1195
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:09,593
I mean, it was pretty good.

1196
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,228
It was a pretty good sight.

1197
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:12,796
- Everybody ready?

1198
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:14,831
Yeah, stand up now
for 30 seconds.

1199
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:23,540
- You guys are incredible.

1200
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,042
Great job.

1201
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,219
- You know, I hope I win this.

1202
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:27,544
- You can put it down now.

1203
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,313
- One block on each side.

1204
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,048
It's, like, super easy,

1205
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,717
but I can imagine it gets
really heavy with four.

1206
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,719
- Everybody's still
in competition.

1207
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:38,288
- Who should I give
more weight to?

1208
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:40,257
- The other dudes look like
they work out a ton,

1209
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:42,426
so I don't know if I'm going to,

1210
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,561
but I'ma let my arms
fall off before I lose.

1211
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:47,431
- Second round.

1212
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,502
- Ooh, you're doing great.
- It's moving a little bit.

1213
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:54,004
- Oh, Aven, you got it.

1214
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:55,339
- I got it?
- You got it.

1215
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:56,606
- This cheese on my back,

1216
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:58,508
it's like
ripping my shoulder apart.

1217
00:57:58,575 --> 00:57:59,910
- You can put it down now.

1218
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,379
- My legs are starting
to wobble, it's heavy,

1219
00:58:02,446 --> 00:58:04,681
but I'm trying to go
as long as I can for Rachel.

1220
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:06,817
- This is the final round.

1221
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:10,253
Okay, lift off.

1222
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,522
You guys look like it's easy.

1223
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,624
- Rachel's worth any test.

1224
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:16,135
You know,
if I have to smell like cheese

1225
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,861
the rest of the day,
I'm willing to do it.

1226
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:20,797
- Who is going to be first?
- That guy right now.

1227
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:22,499
- Tyler,
yours is falling behind you.

1228
00:58:22,566 --> 00:58:23,500
- I'm sweaty.

1229
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:25,068
I did not expect us

1230
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:26,470
having to hold it for that long.

1231
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,872
My hands are cut,
my wrists are cut.

1232
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:31,475
I'm just like, oh, God,
this is gonna look bad.

1233
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:34,378
Aww.

1234
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:36,113
Oh, Aven!

1235
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,582
- Thank God Aven went out
like right after me.

1236
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,026
Then it came down
to Tino and Ethan.

1237
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,251
- Let's go, boys!

1238
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:42,918
- I know you can do it.
- Let's go, boys!

1239
00:58:47,424 --> 00:58:48,425
- Ethan.
- Yeah?

1240
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:49,860
- I'll make you a deal.
- 'Kay.

1241
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:51,228
- If you put yours down first,

1242
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:53,254
I'll do it right after you.
- Ethan, don't buy it.

1243
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:55,899
- I could do this all day.

1244
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:57,834
- All day.
- Keep going.

1245
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:01,138
- I'm sweating so bad.
Thank you, Rachel.

1246
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,539
- I have you on the ropes.

1247
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:14,651
Oh.

1248
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,253
- Oh, God, you were so good.

1249
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,188
You did so good.

1250
00:59:18,255 --> 00:59:19,723
- Thanks.

1251
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,125
We're gonna kiss, right?

1252
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:23,693
- Oh, Ethan!

1253
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,063
- Tino, you know, did well.

1254
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,299
Unfortunate that I didn't
come out victorious.

1255
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:31,201
- Oh, here,
I'll take care of you.

1256
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:32,268
Okay.

1257
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:33,303
All right, I'm good.

1258
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:34,380
- Are you okay?
- Holy.

1259
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,039
I just saw an angel.

1260
00:59:36,106 --> 00:59:37,541
- Oh, it's you.

1261
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:40,077
You know, I can feel it
with Rachel, it's there.

1262
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:42,412
I think our affection
is very palpable,

1263
00:59:42,479 --> 00:59:45,215
so I just need
to continue on that

1264
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:47,651
and show her why I deserve
to bring her home.

1265
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:50,253
- What's up?
- What's wrong?

1266
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,888
- I got all cut up.
That kind of sucked.

1267
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:53,857
Fortunately, right afterwards,

1268
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:56,393
Rachel came over to check up
to make sure I was okay.

1269
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,761
- Ouch.

1270
00:59:57,828 --> 01:00:01,164
- The only cure
is a kiss from Rachel, so...

1271
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:02,999
- I can give you that.

1272
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:04,935
- That sounds good.

1273
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:07,104
Finally, I got my time.
I feel really good.

1274
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,772
Thank God.

1275
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:10,373
She was like,
"That worked out."

1276
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,210
- And now the big moment.

1277
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,680
The cheese king of Edam is...

1278
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:17,848
Tino.

1279
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,022
- I'm the cheese king!

1280
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:27,757
This is so awesome.

1281
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,026
Every shoulder pain
and lower back pain

1282
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:31,962
made every bit of it worth it.

1283
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:34,831
And I'm going into tonight
really confident.

1284
01:00:34,898 --> 01:00:36,867
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

1285
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:40,279
- So I wish today
might have went

1286
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,571
a little bit differently, yeah.

1287
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,840
But Tino and Rachel
are kissing each other

1288
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:45,809
while you just have
to sit there and watch.

1289
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:47,878
It's the worst feeling
in the world.

1290
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,813
But tonight is,
you know, the night

1291
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,448
that I really put it
all out there.

1292
01:00:51,515 --> 01:00:54,284
So Tino won the day,
but don't you worry.

1293
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:55,852
Tyler's got tonight.

1294
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,537
- Do any of us still
smell like cheese,

1295
01:01:04,561 --> 01:01:05,729
or we all good?

1296
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:06,730
- No, I think you guys
smell great.

1297
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:07,731
- We all cleaned up nice.

1298
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:10,000
Today has been so fun.

1299
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:13,503
But tonight, it's all about me
sharing who I am with Rachel.

1300
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:16,907
I want to give her a lot
of reassurance that it would

1301
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:21,077
go amazingly if she wanted
to meet my family.

1302
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:22,879
- Obviously,
there's a rose on the line.

1303
01:01:22,946 --> 01:01:26,416
And if you get that rose,
you're set for Hometowns.

1304
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:28,185
I want that rose
more than anything.

1305
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:30,754
I want to introduce her to my
family more than anything.

1306
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:33,456
I mean, to me,
this is my future wife.

1307
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,692
You're getting the validation
right then and there.

1308
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:36,893
There's nothing better.

1309
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,564
- Well,
I just wanted to say that

1310
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,133
of course today was
really fun and silly,

1311
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,603
but I just kind of
wanted to reinforce

1312
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:49,239
the importance
of the rose tonight.

1313
01:01:49,306 --> 01:01:53,176
I think you guys know
how much I value family,

1314
01:01:53,243 --> 01:01:55,245
and that it's something
that I'm gonna

1315
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:57,214
be putting
a lot of thought into.

1316
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,249
And I just want to cheers
to you guys.

1317
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:01,017
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1318
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:05,488
Tonight's Group Date Rose
is so incredibly important.

1319
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,557
- You want to go talk?
- Yeah.

1320
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:13,163
It means that I'm going
to this person's hometown.

1321
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,933
It's, like, tough because
I still do have really strong

1322
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,768
connections with all these guys.

1323
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:20,971
Choosing
the Group Date Rose tonight,

1324
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:24,774
it's a huge decision
and I hope I can get there.

1325
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:27,153
- I had a great day. Like, all
the activities were so much fun

1326
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:28,478
and like...
- Yeah.

1327
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:30,714
- Anytime I get with you
is obviously so valuable.

1328
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,183
But it did, like,
make me realize, okay,

1329
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,919
I'm just, like,
ready for the next step.

1330
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:40,690
I would be so honored for you
to meet my parents, seriously.

1331
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,525
Those are like definitely,
definitely the two

1332
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,028
most important people
in my life.

1333
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:47,597
- Have you ever brought anyone
home to meet your parents?

1334
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:48,999
- I have.

1335
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:51,801
Like the first one, um,
there was some rough patches

1336
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:54,471
with Dad in getting along.

1337
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:55,972
- Oh, he didn't like her?

1338
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:58,842
- Didn't think
it was a good fit for me.

1339
01:02:58,908 --> 01:02:59,843
- Uh-oh.

1340
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,811
- And he was pretty vocal
about it.

1341
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:02,946
And then...
- Yeah.

1342
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:04,457
- There was some rough patches
with Moms

1343
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:06,283
in the last one.

1344
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:07,860
- Now you're making me
a little nervous.

1345
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,586
- No, don't be nervous.
- I am.

1346
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:12,789
- I have no doubt in my mind
that my mom is gonna

1347
01:03:12,856 --> 01:03:15,258
absolutely adore you,
and my dad will love you too.

1348
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:18,094
- You know, I want them to
like me, but now I know that...

1349
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:19,596
- They're definitely
gonna like you.

1350
01:03:19,663 --> 01:03:20,773
- I feel like I'm gonna go in,
like, thinking that they're,

1351
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,799
like, "Mm, I don't know."
- Oh, my God.

1352
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:24,501
No, they're... no, they're not.

1353
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:26,436
Both my parents
are gonna love you.

1354
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:28,371
They're gonna love me with you.

1355
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:30,874
They're gonna love
how I am with you for sure.

1356
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,842
- It makes me so happy.
- So I'm really excited.

1357
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:50,760
- It is a pretty massive rose
tonight, to say the least.

1358
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,963
- I think it's, uh,
pretty rad that she did

1359
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:57,834
a full-blown after party
with all of us.

1360
01:03:57,901 --> 01:03:59,969
Shows that she's
being really thorough,

1361
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:03,006
rather than just, you know,
single out from the day.

1362
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:05,942
We want her to choose us
'cause she's gotten

1363
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:09,212
the clarity she wants
and then makes her decision.

1364
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:11,581
- I want Rachel
more than anything.

1365
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:15,385
To me, this is my person.
It just feels right.

1366
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:18,188
And tonight,
I'm going to do whatever I can

1367
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:21,925
to prove to her
that I'm her person, too.

1368
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,327
- Doing the group date,
everything was awesome.

1369
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:26,029
Like, I was having a lot of fun.

1370
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:28,498
And at the end, like,
me, Aven, and Ethan

1371
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:30,445
are standing there
and everyone's like chanting.

1372
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,844
I'm like,
"I don't wanna look at this."

1373
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,412
I'm looking at my feet.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1374
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:35,381
- I'm just twiddling my feet.
Like... no, but like I under...

1375
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:37,107
Like, I understood it,
but then like,

1376
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,209
a part of you is just
sitting there just like...

1377
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:40,886
'cause you know that
you're on your own journey,

1378
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,122
but when you see it you're
just like, "Damn, that sucks."

1379
01:04:43,146 --> 01:04:44,381
- I know.
- Yeah.

1380
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,282
- It's tough, I get it.

1381
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,118
But I do, like, want you to know

1382
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:51,554
that what you're feeling
is like,

1383
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,858
so obviously real,
and what I feel is real,

1384
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:59,829
and I want you to just
focus on our relationship.

1385
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,932
I do feel confident
in our connection.

1386
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:04,477
- Yeah.
- And I want you to know that.

1387
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:06,436
- I trust this, like, a lot.

1388
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:09,672
I am 100%, like, ready
to introduce you to my parents.

1389
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,108
I take it very, very seriously.
- Okay.

1390
01:05:12,175 --> 01:05:14,611
- My parents said,
if you bring another girl home,

1391
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:17,347
and she is not the last person
you bring home,

1392
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:18,448
don't bring her.

1393
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:20,517
It's surreal to me,
like, meeting

1394
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,819
somebody like you,
like, it's insane,

1395
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:25,221
and I'm so happy
every single day to be here.

1396
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:27,123
I don't want you ever
to forget, like,

1397
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:30,160
how amazing you are,
because you really are

1398
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:33,396
incredible,
and that's why I'm so like,

1399
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:35,565
falling very, very hard for you,

1400
01:05:35,632 --> 01:05:37,967
because you have so much
to offer and you're everything

1401
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:39,369
I could ever ask for
in somebody.

1402
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,638
I just want you to know that.

1403
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:49,779
- I just feel like my heart
is beating so fast right now.

1404
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:53,583
Tyler continues to be
so vulnerable with me

1405
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:58,087
and tell me exactly
how he feels about me.

1406
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:00,356
He's falling really hard for me,

1407
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:03,226
and that's huge for me to hear.

1408
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:06,981
- I know this is a big week,
and I do really appreciate you

1409
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:08,541
kind of like opening
the floor and you're like...

1410
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:09,809
- Yeah.
- "You know, family is the most

1411
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:11,234
important thing to me."
- Mm-hmm.

1412
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:14,804
- But I do want
to kind of say that

1413
01:06:14,871 --> 01:06:17,006
family is the most important
thing to me as well.

1414
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:19,175
I love my family
more than anything,

1415
01:06:19,242 --> 01:06:20,810
and they mean the world to me.
- Yeah.

1416
01:06:20,877 --> 01:06:24,514
- And honestly,
getting to know you,

1417
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:26,549
you mean the world to me, too.
- Oh.

1418
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:29,219
- I want to introduce you
to them.

1419
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:30,820
I was like,

1420
01:06:30,887 --> 01:06:34,757
waiting for the person
to like, open up my heart too,

1421
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,259
and it's you.

1422
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:45,335
Rachel is definitely

1423
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:47,770
the person I could see myself
falling in love with.

1424
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,005
Absolutely.

1425
01:06:49,072 --> 01:06:51,708
Of course,
I would like that rose tonight

1426
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:53,943
and to be able
to go to bed tonight

1427
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:59,949
knowing that I can bring Rachel
home to my dad and my sister.

1428
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,684
It's just tough.

1429
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:04,988
You know, there's some
stiff competition.

1430
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,200
- You never, like,
think in a million years

1431
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:10,260
you're actually gonna
end up at Hometowns.

1432
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:11,461
- And it's crazy.

1433
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,239
- It's so wild.
- It's so real now.

1434
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:15,698
I mean, whoever gets
this rose tonight,

1435
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:19,102
like,
you're locked in Hometowns.

1436
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:21,538
Introducing the family.
- Yeah.

1437
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,808
- Yeah, I mean,
Tino's been a front-runner

1438
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,044
in all of this
since the beginning.

1439
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:29,679
I mean, on
the First Impression Rose...

1440
01:07:29,746 --> 01:07:31,014
- Right, right.

1441
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,550
- And he did get crowned
the cheese king too, today.

1442
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:36,853
- And he won today, yeah.
- Guy stays winning.

1443
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:39,665
- I'm trying not
to think about it,

1444
01:07:39,689 --> 01:07:40,623
to be honest.
- Yeah.

1445
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,125
- Next week's big, man.

1446
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:44,036
I think tonight is, like,
you gotta lay it all out there.

1447
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,194
- Right, right.

1448
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:48,097
Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

1449
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:52,569
- So I just wanted to like
make sure that you were feeling

1450
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:56,239
okay with everything
about next week,

1451
01:07:56,306 --> 01:07:58,575
and kind of
what it looks like and...

1452
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:00,081
- I would have done it
two weeks ago.

1453
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:03,257
- If I could have wrapped
this up, rest assured,

1454
01:08:03,313 --> 01:08:05,682
I would have been stoked
to bring you back.

1455
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,017
- How has your family
reacted to people

1456
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,986
that you've brought home
in the past?

1457
01:08:10,053 --> 01:08:13,056
- I'm not worried about,
like, really anybody.

1458
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:15,258
When they see and hear
how I feel about you,

1459
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:17,560
they're... you know, like,
you know my personality,

1460
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:19,562
I'll be like,
"You're going to like her."

1461
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:21,664
But like, I mean, you just...

1462
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:25,068
You really leave, like,
no doubt in my mind.

1463
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:27,236
Haven't had a doubt in weeks.

1464
01:08:31,074 --> 01:08:33,643
Any reservations with me?

1465
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:35,745
- Um, I have a couple.

1466
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:37,780
Oh, yeah? What's that?

1467
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,490
I think I just totally hit it

1468
01:08:47,557 --> 01:08:49,726
out of the park,
and I'm like almost speechless.

1469
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,295
It went unbelievably well.

1470
01:08:52,362 --> 01:08:55,131
I don't want to leave you
with no doubt

1471
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:57,533
'cause I'm just so sure of you.

1472
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,003
- Oh?
- Yeah.

1473
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:02,872
All this kind of
excitement that I feel for her

1474
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:05,975
is like unfamiliar,
and it's exciting

1475
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:07,443
and exhilarating and terrifying

1476
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:08,645
at the same time.

1477
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:10,546
And this is a rose though, like,

1478
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:12,348
I want more than usual.

1479
01:09:12,415 --> 01:09:14,050
I'm really expecting it
because I'd like

1480
01:09:14,117 --> 01:09:17,820
to literally think
I'm her person.

1481
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:22,659
- I did have such an incredible
night with all of you guys.

1482
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:27,664
Of course,
this is very important, so...

1483
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:29,232
Um...

1484
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:34,337
I just want to say that you all
have been incredible tonight.

1485
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:38,141
But this rose can only
go to one person,

1486
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:43,880
and this person continues
to make me feel so incredible.

1487
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:47,950
And I could not
be more confident

1488
01:09:48,051 --> 01:09:52,588
that I would just love to meet
your family next week.

1489
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:55,324
And so with that being said,

1490
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:58,428
Tyler, will you accept
this rose?

1491
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:00,229
- Absolutely.

1492
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:12,508
- I had such a great night
with all of you.

1493
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:16,979
With that being said,
I'll wish you guys a good night.

1494
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:25,254
- I'll see you soon.

1495
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:29,225
- Okay, bye, guys.

1496
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:41,938
- Congrats. Seriously.

1497
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:50,980
I'm at a loss for words.

1498
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:52,348
I don't get it.

1499
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,618
Like, I hit every point today,

1500
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:57,920
had the amazing moments.

1501
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:00,323
I mean, we literally
were just talking about like,

1502
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:02,859
she feels so strongly for me,
and like,

1503
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:05,161
I just can't see something

1504
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:07,063
connecting on a deeper level
than that.

1505
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,999
Like, getting it
after I crushed today,

1506
01:11:10,066 --> 01:11:11,934
and that, would be like,

1507
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:14,737
I'm rolling into Hometown
and I'm about to fight.

1508
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:16,272
Zach out, or Aven out,

1509
01:11:16,339 --> 01:11:18,350
or anybody else who tries
to in these waters.

1510
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:21,377
You're toast.
Done. Let's roll.

1511
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:23,713
- Tino's acting like
a real baby back bitch.

1512
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,114
- Yeah.

1513
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:26,391
- I mean, he's won the day.
- You know?

1514
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:27,893
I'd be feeling pretty

1515
01:11:27,917 --> 01:11:30,319
good about myself
if I won today.

1516
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:34,557
I mean, you didn't win.

1517
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:37,226
- And I still got a better
attitude about it, you know?

1518
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:40,062
This is a joke.

1519
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:43,966
It really makes me wonder if
I am not seeing things clearly.

1520
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:46,903
I don't think she knows
how deeply I feel.

1521
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,172
The fear is that
I'm falling really hard

1522
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:50,973
for this girl, and she's not,

1523
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,144
and that never has occurred
to me until tonight.

1524
01:11:58,581 --> 01:12:03,719
And now, like, this is making me
second guess everything.

1525
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,796
- All right,
so Rose Ceremony tonight.

1526
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:15,565
So I wanted
to check in with you again,

1527
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:17,109
see how you're doing.
- Yeah. Thank you.

1528
01:12:17,133 --> 01:12:18,367
- How you feeling?

1529
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:21,003
- I am feeling better
this morning.

1530
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,572
- I know this has been a really,

1531
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:24,140
really tough week
for you obviously.

1532
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:25,217
- Yeah.
- With Nate now gone.

1533
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:26,375
- Yeah.

1534
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:27,586
- Now everything
that's happened with Logan.

1535
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:28,845
- Yeah.

1536
01:12:28,911 --> 01:12:31,314
- How does that impact
how you feel about

1537
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,758
your relationships
with these other men,

1538
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:34,750
potentially going on
for Hometowns?

1539
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:37,753
- I want to leave here
with someone I feel good about.

1540
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:40,790
I want to be in love.
I want to find my person.

1541
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,992
- Mm-hmm.
- But some of my relationships

1542
01:12:43,059 --> 01:12:45,828
just haven't been able to
progress the way that my other

1543
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:49,866
ones have and there's truly no
explanation or rhyme or reason.

1544
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:50,943
Some relationships,
you feel like

1545
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:52,435
you're just not compatible.

1546
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:54,213
- All right, so then
what do you want to do tonight?

1547
01:12:54,237 --> 01:12:56,138
- At this point,
I'm not really sure.

1548
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:59,008
But I think I need more time

1549
01:12:59,075 --> 01:13:01,210
to really weigh
all of my options.

1550
01:13:01,277 --> 01:13:02,454
- I know you got
a lot to think about.

1551
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:03,412
I'll leave you
with your thoughts.

1552
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:04,747
- Yeah.

1553
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:06,058
- And I'll see you at
the Rose Ceremony tonight.

1554
01:13:06,082 --> 01:13:08,084
- Okay, thanks, Jesse.
- Okay. All right, Gabby.

1555
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:10,119
Thank you. We'll see ya.
- Okay, thank you.

1556
01:13:10,186 --> 01:13:12,288
Rose Ceremony days are always

1557
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:14,257
definitely really heavy.

1558
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:17,326
This week,
I had to send Nate home,

1559
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:21,998
and then Logan can't be joining
us for the rest of our journey.

1560
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,667
And so now I have four men,

1561
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:28,271
but I still have
hard decisions to make.

1562
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:31,641
It's taken a lot of thought
in considering Hometowns,

1563
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:33,976
but I think I have
a pretty good idea

1564
01:13:34,043 --> 01:13:36,913
of how I want to proceed into
the Rose Ceremony tonight.

1565
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:43,219
- Not trying to, like,
invalidate your feelings.

1566
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:47,623
I think just last night,
we... we just,

1567
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:51,560
you know, took some disrespect
to, you know, walking off

1568
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:56,065
because, you know, we're
all here for the same reason.

1569
01:13:56,132 --> 01:13:58,467
- The end shook me a lot.
- Yeah.

1570
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:01,737
- That's why I kind of wasn't...
Couldn't really focus

1571
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:03,639
during the chat after...
- Yeah.

1572
01:14:03,706 --> 01:14:05,508
- And I split a little early,
and I feel bad.

1573
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:08,477
I should have been there
to like, be there for you guys

1574
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:09,946
for sure, and...
- Yeah.

1575
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:12,848
You had a good day
yesterday, man.

1576
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:14,250
During the day, right?

1577
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:16,619
- Just... yeah, I mean,
but you still want, like,

1578
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:20,323
the night was... you know,
I felt like next level.

1579
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:23,292
You know, I felt like I hit
new levels of vulnerability

1580
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:27,096
not just with her but with
like anybody in a long time.

1581
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:29,398
Yesterday made zero sense to me.

1582
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:31,167
I didn't get
the Group Date Rose,

1583
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:34,370
and it just felt like
a blind side.

1584
01:14:34,437 --> 01:14:36,806
I told her repeatedly
that I was sure

1585
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:39,175
and it looked like
it lit up her world.

1586
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:42,511
But, you know,
now I'm thinking, well,

1587
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:44,046
she didn't say she was sure.

1588
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:48,217
Not getting that, like,
does, you know, inevitably

1589
01:14:48,284 --> 01:14:51,120
kind of draw certain
insecurities where you're like,

1590
01:14:51,187 --> 01:14:53,222
is she not as sure as I am,

1591
01:14:53,289 --> 01:14:55,658
or you know,
as I want her to be?

1592
01:14:55,725 --> 01:14:57,393
And I want to leave her
with no doubt

1593
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,862
and I thought I did
last night, so...

1594
01:14:59,929 --> 01:15:03,933
I don't know if I'm just
not seeing it correctly.

1595
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,035
I mean, at this point,
like, I have no idea

1596
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:08,471
if she's gonna be like,
meeting my family

1597
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:11,707
and friends,
or if I'm going home.

1598
01:15:11,774 --> 01:15:13,509
It's hard to look at it
and not think of it

1599
01:15:13,576 --> 01:15:16,045
as a huge step backwards.

1600
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,455
- Tonight's a big Rose Ceremony.

1601
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,657
It's huge.
I'm very nervous.

1602
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:31,293
If Gabby were to look at you
and ask if you accepted a rose,

1603
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,330
I think, you know, she's saying
I want to continue this.

1604
01:15:34,397 --> 01:15:35,607
This is going
in the right direction

1605
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:37,500
and I would love
to meet your family.

1606
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:40,002
- Nobody has a rose
going into tonight's ceremony.

1607
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:41,470
I think a lot of us
are just kind of

1608
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:42,781
questioning where...
Where we are.

1609
01:15:42,805 --> 01:15:44,206
I'm not alone in that.

1610
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:47,743
But there's usually four
Hometowns and Logan is gone.

1611
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:50,446
So seems like nobody
should be going home tonight.

1612
01:15:50,513 --> 01:15:51,647
Honestly, I don't know.

1613
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,582
Just going in there
hoping for the best.

1614
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,429
- Walking into
the Rose Ceremony,

1615
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:10,099
I see three roses
on the podium and obviously,

1616
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:12,835
that means one person
is going home,

1617
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:15,538
and it was pretty shocking.

1618
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:20,242
I think everybody's
a little nervous.

1619
01:16:26,849 --> 01:16:31,220
- Hi, guys.
You guys all look so handsome.

1620
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:35,891
I just wanted to thank you all
for the most

1621
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,861
amazing week in the Netherlands.

1622
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:42,364
I can't thank you enough
for being here with me.

1623
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:46,969
This week for us
threw us a ton of curveballs.

1624
01:16:47,036 --> 01:16:51,040
So many things that truly
I didn't even know

1625
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:53,476
how to plan for.

1626
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:56,545
I feel like I'm not at the point
where I can meet

1627
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:59,248
four men's families.

1628
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:03,552
I do only feel comfortable,

1629
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,522
you know,
giving out three roses.

1630
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:25,608
Erich.

1631
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:35,618
Erich, will you accept
this rose?

1632
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:37,319
- Yes, of course.

1633
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:54,436
- Jason.

1634
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:01,911
Will you accept this rose?
- Of course.

1635
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:11,787
- Gabby is one
of the most incredible women

1636
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:13,889
I've ever met,
and I know that my family

1637
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:15,133
and her would
have an amazing time.

1638
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:16,692
I want that rose
from Gabby tonight.

1639
01:18:16,759 --> 01:18:18,961
There's no question about it.

1640
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,308
- Johnny.

1641
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:38,814
Johnny.

1642
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:41,250
Will you accept this rose?
- Go on.

1643
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:46,222
This makes me happy.
Thank you.

1644
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:52,561
I feel ecstatic right now.

1645
01:18:52,628 --> 01:18:53,905
I feel like we made a connection

1646
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:55,831
and I feel like
there was no denying it.

1647
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:59,435
She gave me a rose and it's
like, whew, I could breathe.

1648
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:02,705
Talk about nerve-racking, dude.

1649
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:03,839
God.
- Of course, man.

1650
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:10,913
- You all truly make me feel
like I'm the only girl

1651
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:14,516
in the room
in your own unique ways,

1652
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:19,021
which I think makes
tonight's decision really

1653
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:22,658
difficult because all three
of you are truly incredible,

1654
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:25,995
and my heart already breaks
thinking about having

1655
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:28,764
to say goodbye to one of you,
but ultimately,

1656
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:31,533
I think I just have
to follow my heart.

1657
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,936
- This week, I didn't get
the Group Date Rose

1658
01:19:34,003 --> 01:19:36,372
that I thought I earned.

1659
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:37,773
That hurt.

1660
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,408
It made me, like,
question everything.

1661
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:44,246
And now me, Aven, and Ethan
are on the block.

1662
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:47,483
I want this rose
so badly right now.

1663
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:49,184
This wouldn't bother me
this much

1664
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:51,687
if I wasn't, like,
falling in love with her.

1665
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:11,607
Aven.

1666
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:18,981
Aven, will you accept this rose?
- Absolutely.

1667
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:38,133
- Gabby, Rachel, gentlemen.

1668
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,703
It's the final rose tonight.

1669
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:42,271
When you're ready.

1670
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:05,627
Tino.

1671
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:13,769
Tino, will you accept this rose?

1672
01:21:13,836 --> 01:21:15,604
- Always.

1673
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:19,475
Thank you, beautiful.

1674
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:29,651
Made it.
The nerves wash away.

1675
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,653
I have never been so stoked.

1676
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,223
Hometowns, let's go.
- Let's do it.

1677
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:43,732
Spencer, Ethan, I'm sorry.

1678
01:21:43,799 --> 01:21:46,335
Please take a moment
and say your goodbyes.

1679
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:51,473
- Thank you, Gabriela.

1680
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:52,941
- Thank you so much
for everything.

1681
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:55,511
- Yeah. Thank you.
Good luck.

1682
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,045
Those guys are great.
- Thank you.

1683
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:59,515
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1684
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:03,318
- Rach,
thank you for everything.

1685
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:05,287
Wish you nothing but the best,
okay?

1686
01:22:05,354 --> 01:22:07,423
- I just want you to know.

1687
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:11,760
You have made this
experience so positive for me.

1688
01:22:11,827 --> 01:22:13,662
- Thank you
for this opportunity.

1689
01:22:13,729 --> 01:22:15,831
You light up every room
you're in too.

1690
01:22:15,898 --> 01:22:17,499
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you.

1691
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:19,968
Good luck, okay?
- You, too.

1692
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:21,570
Bye.

1693
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:25,207
Hi, guys.
- Hi.

1694
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:27,409
- Ooh.
- How are you doing?

1695
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:30,546
- When Rachel walked in, I was
so happy, like, in the moment.

1696
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:33,348
And you think to yourself
like, "Wow.

1697
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:35,951
I'm really, really
falling for this girl."

1698
01:22:36,018 --> 01:22:38,053
Like, I can't wait
to introduce you to my family

1699
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,721
and tell them
everything about her.

1700
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,490
- How do you guys feel?

1701
01:22:41,557 --> 01:22:42,557
- Excited?

1702
01:22:42,591 --> 01:22:43,892
- Yeah?
- Hometowns, like, yeah.

1703
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:46,361
- I think this
could be one of the best

1704
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:49,298
weeks here
and the most exciting.

1705
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:52,801
And honestly,
I'm grateful that you are

1706
01:22:52,868 --> 01:22:55,737
welcoming me into
this big part of your life.

1707
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,406
- I'm super excited.

1708
01:22:57,473 --> 01:22:59,017
I think once I see my parents,
they're gonna be like,

1709
01:22:59,041 --> 01:23:01,777
"Oh."

1710
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:03,321
Like, this...
He actually likes this girl.

1711
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:04,947
This is when it gets real.

1712
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:06,257
To Hometowns.
- To a memorable...

1713
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:07,583
- Yeah. Yeah.

1714
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:11,653
- Cheers to this
amazing lady right here.

1715
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,923
I'm super excited I get to
show off the most amazing lady

1716
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,059
of all time
to the people I love.

1717
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:18,861
What actually could be better?

1718
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:21,430
I know I speak for all of us
when I say

1719
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:24,299
it's been the adventure
of a lifetime and I'm so glad

1720
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:27,135
the people I love
now get to join it.

1721
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:29,204
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

1722
01:23:30,873 --> 01:23:33,542
- Next week
on "The Bachelorette"...

1723
01:23:33,609 --> 01:23:35,010
- Oh, my God!

1724
01:23:35,077 --> 01:23:37,913
I'm so excited to meet families

1725
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,181
and deepen our connections.

1726
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:41,216
- I'm happy here.
- Me, too.

1727
01:23:41,283 --> 01:23:43,652
- It really feels like
a taste of the future.

1728
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:45,687
This is the best day ever.

1729
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:47,489
- I am in love with you, Rachel.

1730
01:23:47,556 --> 01:23:50,459
- I have been
falling in love with you.

1731
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:53,395
I feel so happy.

1732
01:23:53,462 --> 01:23:55,764
- I just feel sorry
for those other fellas.

1733
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:57,499
That's all I could say.

1734
01:23:57,566 --> 01:23:59,143
- It's scary to, like,
open up and show somebody

1735
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,469
my entire world.

1736
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:03,872
- I'm terrified, cause I know
how much I have to lose.

1737
01:24:03,939 --> 01:24:06,408
- Just trying to stay true
to myself.

1738
01:24:06,475 --> 01:24:09,077
- It's important to keep in mind

1739
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:10,913
what would it be like
without her.

1740
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:13,348
It makes me cry.

1741
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:14,816
- When you know, you know.

1742
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,203
- We're gonna
have to have a talk.

1743
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:18,120
You're living like
a fairy tale right now.

1744
01:24:18,186 --> 01:24:19,922
I mean, you're saying
all the right things,

1745
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:22,691
but I want to see him
fall for the right person.

1746
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:24,669
- I don't know how I made it
out of that house alive.

1747
01:24:24,693 --> 01:24:26,028
I almost cried.

1748
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:30,098
- I feel bad not saying
all this to you earlier.

1749
01:24:30,165 --> 01:24:32,367
- I care about him so much,
and then to hear that...

1750
01:24:32,434 --> 01:24:34,736
I feel like
my heart is breaking.

1751
01:24:38,874 --> 01:24:40,051
- Do you know
how to ride a bike?

1752
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:41,310
- It's been years.

1753
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:42,656
- I don't remember if I know how

1754
01:24:42,711 --> 01:24:43,855
to get on my bike.
- Let's see.

1755
01:24:43,879 --> 01:24:45,547
This is gonna be entertaining.
- Okay.

1756
01:24:45,614 --> 01:24:46,982
I'm actually a little nervous...

1757
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:48,250
- Oh, I'm so nervous.

1758
01:24:48,317 --> 01:24:51,386
- Okay, you read...
This is really...

1759
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:54,156
Who put my seat up this high?

1760
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:57,025
Does it go up?

1761
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:58,692
I can't reach the pedals.
- You got this.

1762
01:24:58,727 --> 01:25:00,128
I believe in you.
- I'm scared.

1763
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:02,397
But, okay, ready, set...

1764
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:04,266
Oh, no, I can't reach it!

1765
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:07,169
I can't reach the pedals.

1766
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:08,570
- You gonna pedal
with your hands?

1767
01:25:08,637 --> 01:25:10,472
- No, I have to get this pedal.

1768
01:25:10,539 --> 01:25:12,574
Oh.

1769
01:25:12,641 --> 01:25:14,085
All right,
I'm gonna have to help you up.

1770
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,678
- This is... it's too hard.
- I'm helping you up.

1771
01:25:16,745 --> 01:25:18,413
- I could do it.
It's just really high up.

1772
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,815
- Let's get her training wheels.

1773
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:22,484
Where are the training wheels?
- I need a kid's bike.

1774
01:25:23,986 --> 01:25:25,787
- Oh, oh.

1775
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:27,923
- I got it!
- Keep going.

1776
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,992
- I got! Ah!
- Keep going.

1777
01:25:30,058 --> 01:25:31,293
Keep going.

1778
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,428
Keep going.

1779
01:25:34,763 --> 01:25:36,765
- Let's see if it feels easier
out here.

1780
01:25:36,832 --> 01:25:38,967
- There it is.

1781
01:25:38,991 --> 01:25:40,991
