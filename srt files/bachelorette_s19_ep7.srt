gonna be more quiet,

to him as a person.

She does. That's for you.

It's so nice to meet you.

178

I'm so glad to see you.

179

Oh,
you're making me emotional.

180
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:06,758
You're so sweet.

181
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:10,554
Having my dad here today,
meeting Gabby, is so exciting.

182
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,073
You know, his opinion
means everything to me,

183
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:15,127
and it's gonna be
a really special day.

184

I haven't talked to you

Tell me... tell me
the exciting adventures.

187
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,936
This has been
the craziest, most...

188
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:26,772
Really? Just because of
the environment and isolation?

It's just... I can't describe
how crazy it is.

Jason's character
shone through right away.

He has stood out
in such a special way.

- Yeah.
- I missed him.

201
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,070
Our family has always been
a very emotional family.

202
00:07:58,136 --> 00:08:02,140
And Gabby said such
positive things about Jason.

203
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:03,842
Should we go chat
over there for a little bit?

204
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:05,177
Okay.

205
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:08,714
But I'm only hoping
for my son's happiness.

206
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,016
I think he's on
a very good path

207
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:15,053
if he continues
to grow like this.

208
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,023

a great experience?

Gabby definitely makes it
worth it.

214
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:30,168
Meeting my family
is a huge deal, and...

I've ever met.

219
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,679
And I feel like we,
this whole time,

220
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:43,382
have had this, like,
energetic connection

that, like, sometimes you don't
even need to say something.

Well, we'll see.

I mean, Gabby seemed
very mature,

228
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,836
and I could feel her warmth,
her easiness,

229
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:09,474
and she's beautiful,
and you're projecting

230
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:14,946
happiness and calmness
and ease with it, I can see.

You've been nonstop smiling,

that I could be a part of it.

I'll always support you 100%.

I was falling in love with her.

And this date
is incredibly pivotal.

right off the bat.

601

we immediately started off

602
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,077
our relationship
talking about all of you

603
00:24:07,144 --> 00:24:09,780
and talking about family,
and he got emotional.

604
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:13,817
And I feel like
that really was what solidified

605
00:24:13,884 --> 00:24:16,620
just how great he is for me,
on top of everything

606

about you and your wife,

611
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:30,547
how you guys are still
very much in love, so...

is that there are other...

is how fast

Knowing that he is
falling in love with you,

is that someone that you could
see spending forever with?

- This is so incredible...

because I know

but there are,

that truly no one else has,

661
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:16,907
and our relationship
is different.

to happen to your child.

it is for real.

00:31:15,872 --> 00:31:17,440
Getting on a knee
is a huge thing,

793
00:31:17,507 --> 00:31:19,643
and so I need everything
to come together today.

794
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:21,811
What did you think night one?

795
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:23,113
- Night one?
- [laughter]

796
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:24,514
- Yes.
- Wait, I rapped.

797
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:26,416
I, like, put, like,
a couple words together,

798
00:31:26,483 --> 00:31:27,417
and, uh...

799
00:31:27,484 --> 00:31:28,451
[laughter]

800
00:31:28,518 --> 00:31:30,453
No, no,
but it was really smooth.

801
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,588
It sounded better.

802
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:32,689
- So...
- I was gonna call it a poem,

803
00:31:32,756 --> 00:31:34,024
but that would almost be worse.

804
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,191
It had rhythm.

805
00:31:35,258 --> 00:31:36,993
- And you kept him.
- No, I did. Yeah!

806
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,362
- Unbelievable.
- He had confidence, rhythm.

807
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:40,830
The best girlfriend ever.

808
00:31:40,897 --> 00:31:42,565
- Aww.
- That's what he always says.

809
00:31:42,632 --> 00:31:44,234
It's so cute.

810
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,869
Meeting Johnny's family,
we start

811
00:31:45,935 --> 00:31:47,203
telling stories right away.

812
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:50,273
I watch Johnny light up,
and he gets so excited.

813
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,842
I felt like I had
known them for years.

814
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:54,210
Gabby, would you like
to have a talk?

815
00:31:54,277 --> 00:31:55,545
I'd love to.

816
00:31:55,612 --> 00:31:58,615
This is how I am
with my family,

817
00:31:58,682 --> 00:32:00,617
and it is comforting
and it's fun.

818
00:32:00,684 --> 00:32:03,219
I noticed
when you guys are together,

819
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:05,588
it's pretty amazing for
such a short period of time,

820
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:06,623
the chemistry you guys have.

821
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,792
Yeah, no, he is one

822
00:32:08,858 --> 00:32:12,262
who I've always known
I could be myself around.

823
00:32:12,328 --> 00:32:14,864
He's always been
really sweet with me

824
00:32:14,931 --> 00:32:18,435
and really opened up to me,
and we got so much closer.

825
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:21,304
I think it was
what we needed to know

826
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:23,760
that we could see a future,
I guess.

827
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:27,346
So I'm glad you said that
'cause my question to you is,

828
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:29,066
where do you see yourself
with Johnny?

829
00:32:29,132 --> 00:32:29,946
Yeah.

830
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,835
If he got down on one knee,
I know the whole...

831
00:32:31,902 --> 00:32:33,437
It is something that
we would have to talk about,

832
00:32:33,503 --> 00:32:35,339
you know, which we haven't yet.

833
00:32:35,405 --> 00:32:36,587
Of course.

834
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:39,175
But knowing that Johnny
and I have your support

835
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:40,611
- means a lot to me.
- Absolutely.

836
00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:42,379
I know it means so much
to him.

837
00:32:42,446 --> 00:32:44,032
I think you're great.

838
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,031
Hell, you know, we're all in!

839
00:32:46,116 --> 00:32:47,918
- Yeah.
- [both laughing]

840
00:32:48,003 --> 00:32:50,554
Gabby's great. She really is.

841
00:32:50,621 --> 00:32:52,489
I think they would be
perfect together,

842
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:53,857
the way they play
off each other,

843
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:56,426
and I was really happy
to see my son happy.

844
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:59,663
And I hope this
is the love he finds.

845
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,765
I remember him
coming out of the limo,

846
00:33:01,832 --> 00:33:03,300
and I was like, "Oh, my God."

847
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:05,335
- Really?
- "That's my type." Yeah!

848
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,004
And then he has this charisma
about him,

849
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,472
his blue eyes
and his eyelashes.

850
00:33:08,538 --> 00:33:09,706
Right.

851
00:33:09,773 --> 00:33:11,174
I don't think
you can really get...

852
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:12,643
- Resist?
- Yeah.

853
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:14,711
The connection with you
and Johnny seems very organic.

854
00:33:14,778 --> 00:33:17,481
- Yeah.
- Whether it's for now or ever,

855
00:33:17,547 --> 00:33:19,983
I think
it's really, really cool.

856
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:22,419
Yeah. Do you think
that he is, like, ready

857
00:33:22,486 --> 00:33:25,656
to be in a long-term
relationship?

858
00:33:25,722 --> 00:33:28,558
Well, the thing
about Johnny is,

859
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:30,527
he doesn't give his heart
to anybody.

860
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:31,762
Yeah.

861
00:33:31,828 --> 00:33:34,564
And if Johnny were to say,
"This is it,"

862
00:33:34,631 --> 00:33:36,633
you're in
for a different Johnny

863
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,536
and very fortunate
because he's extremely loyal.

864
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:41,071
You know,
he has so much to give

865
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:42,596
and has such a big heart,

866
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:44,141
so obviously I think
he saw something

867
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:45,575
in you and he felt safe.

868
00:33:45,642 --> 00:33:47,044
- Right.
- I'm glad.

869
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,346
We're along for the ride,
whatever it is.

870
00:33:49,413 --> 00:33:50,747
- You guys are amazing.
- Thank you.

871
00:33:50,814 --> 00:33:51,848
So yeah.

872
00:33:51,915 --> 00:33:53,784
I was very excited
to see Johnny,

873
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,052
but I was really anxious.

874
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:56,720
And as soon as I spoke
with her,

875
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:58,922
I was instantly relieved.

876
00:33:58,989 --> 00:34:01,325
You know, he loves
to be in love,

877
00:34:01,391 --> 00:34:04,394
and I could definitely see that
with those two.

878
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:06,063
How do we feel about this girl?

879
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,097
Oh, she's amazing.

880
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:08,198
- Yeah.
- Can you tell?

881
00:34:08,265 --> 00:34:09,966
Oh, my gosh. Yeah.

882
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:12,269
We literally
don't stop laughing.

883
00:34:12,336 --> 00:34:14,004
- That's the craziest part.
- Yeah, she has... yeah.

884
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:16,206
I can see
how it's a lot of fun.

885
00:34:16,273 --> 00:34:17,974
I definitely see myself
falling for this girl.

886
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:19,176
- Yeah.
- I mean, she's amazing.

887
00:34:19,242 --> 00:34:20,944
- Yeah.
- She's perfect.

888
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:23,780
But my whole thing is just
not being fully there yet.

889
00:34:23,847 --> 00:34:25,115
Mm-hmm.

890
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:27,351
To just drop and get married,

891
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:28,985
that's, like,
a huge step for me,

892
00:34:29,052 --> 00:34:30,654
and I don't know
if I'm ready for that.

893
00:34:30,721 --> 00:34:32,989
But it's something I haven't
talked about with her yet,

894
00:34:33,056 --> 00:34:34,891
and I know that's something
she wants, so...

895
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,927
- Yeah.
- You know...

896
00:34:38,128 --> 00:34:40,764
Make sure that whatever you do,
it's coming from your heart

897
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:43,166
and that it's...
It's a commitment.

898
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:44,201
It's a big commitment.

899
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:45,435
- It's a huge commitment.
- Yeah.

900
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:47,804
And you don't
take it haphazardly.

901
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:50,674
I know you'll decide
if now is the time,

902
00:34:50,741 --> 00:34:53,910
and we'll support you
in whatever decision you make.

903
00:34:53,977 --> 00:34:55,746
- Big decisions.
- Mm-hmm.

904
00:34:55,812 --> 00:34:57,514
Talking to my mom
is amazing.

905
00:34:57,581 --> 00:34:59,716
She was being honest
and upfront with me,

906
00:34:59,783 --> 00:35:02,085
and there's a lot
going through my head.

907
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:03,353
I love you too.

908
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,654
It kind of just makes
everything harder

909
00:35:04,721 --> 00:35:06,423
when you do see yourself
with this person,

910
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,625
but you don't know
if you're there in life,

911
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,360
so it's a bunch of emotions.

912
00:35:10,427 --> 00:35:13,430
It's like juggling
everything at once.

913
00:35:13,497 --> 00:35:15,932
That's a big thing,
to get on a knee for someone.

914
00:35:15,999 --> 00:35:17,200
Yeah.

915
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:18,869
She's an amazing person,
but the only thing

916
00:35:18,935 --> 00:35:20,871
that's kind of stopping me
right now is...

917
00:35:20,937 --> 00:35:22,839
- Stopping you from what?
- What's stopping you?

918
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:26,176
- Just engagement at the end.
- Mm-hmm. That's scary.

919
00:35:26,243 --> 00:35:27,444
I wanted her to meet you guys

920
00:35:27,511 --> 00:35:29,246
and see how you guys felt
about her

921
00:35:29,312 --> 00:35:31,381
and try to just make
the next step forward.

922
00:35:31,448 --> 00:35:33,116
- I mean, that's a...
- It's a big commitment.

923
00:35:33,183 --> 00:35:34,618
Big commitment.

924
00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:35,986
That's something
you gotta think about.

925
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:37,320
But, the way you guys walked in

926
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:39,523
and interacted with each other,
it's like,

927
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:40,891
I just saw the chemistry.

928
00:35:40,957 --> 00:35:44,561
And I said to myself,
"She could be the one."

929
00:35:44,628 --> 00:35:46,797
That's a scary thing
to say itself.

930
00:35:46,863 --> 00:35:48,432
One of the things you say to
me is, like, "I'm not ready."

931
00:35:48,498 --> 00:35:50,133
Well, how?

932
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,301
Emotionally?

933
00:35:51,368 --> 00:35:52,536
I think you're ready
emotionally.

934
00:35:52,602 --> 00:35:53,870
Financially?

935
00:35:53,937 --> 00:35:55,472
You go down the road together.

936
00:35:55,539 --> 00:35:57,741
- And that's kind of important.
- Yeah.

937
00:35:57,808 --> 00:35:59,543
- Go with your heart.
- I appreciate that.

938
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:02,446
I mean, we met her,
we think she's very lovely,

939
00:36:02,512 --> 00:36:04,047
and you have my blessing.

940
00:36:04,114 --> 00:36:05,816
[soft music]

941
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:07,651
Come here. I love you.

942
00:36:07,717 --> 00:36:09,519
My dad, you know,
gave me great advice.

943
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:11,354
He was more on the side
of going for it.

944
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:12,522
Yeah!

945
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:13,557
It was really
a pleasure meeting you.

946
00:36:13,623 --> 00:36:14,758
It was so great meeting you.

947
00:36:14,825 --> 00:36:16,893
Today went amazing.

948
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,528

1415
00:56:31,728 --> 00:56:32,729
How have you been?

1416
00:56:32,795 --> 00:56:33,796
I have good days
and bad days.

1417
00:56:33,863 --> 00:56:35,164
- Yeah.
- So...

1418
00:56:35,231 --> 00:56:37,333
I mean, I kind of
filled her in on everything.

1419
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,302
She was an ICU nurse.

1420
00:56:39,369 --> 00:56:40,970
I did hear that.

1421
00:56:41,037 --> 00:56:42,772
This is
the in-home nurse here.

1422
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,440
Labor of love.

1423
00:56:44,507 --> 00:56:46,042
Everything that you guys
are going through,

1424
00:56:46,109 --> 00:56:47,844
it really means the world,
honestly,

1425
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:50,446
for you to allow us in.

1426
00:56:50,513 --> 00:56:51,748
[soft music]

1427
00:56:51,814 --> 00:56:53,249
My dad is...

1428
00:56:53,316 --> 00:56:55,918
He's struggling for sure
to be there to meet Gabby,

1429
00:56:55,985 --> 00:56:58,921
and for it to be,
like, a family thing.

1430
00:56:58,988 --> 00:57:02,158
All right, Grandpa, you can
go enjoy the outside now.

1431
00:57:02,225 --> 00:57:05,094
I have to, like, show my dad
how much he means to me

1432
00:57:05,161 --> 00:57:07,163
because it's really important.

1433
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,699
I missed the hell
out of you, man.

1434
00:57:09,766 --> 00:57:11,067
I really did.

1435
00:57:11,134 --> 00:57:12,168
How are you doing? Okay?

1436
00:57:13,936 --> 00:57:15,204
Oh, wow.

1437
00:57:15,271 --> 00:57:16,906
So yeah, I had some
pretty serious operations.

1438
00:57:16,973 --> 00:57:17,907
- Yeah.
- But I'm still here,

1439
00:57:17,974 --> 00:57:18,908
and I'm happy, I'm positive,

1440
00:57:18,975 --> 00:57:21,177
- you know, so that's good.
- Mm-hmm.

1441
00:57:21,244 --> 00:57:23,413
But I really admired...

1442
00:57:27,683 --> 00:57:31,020
The ICU nurses.
They're so sharp, right?

1443
00:57:31,087 --> 00:57:33,289
We get really close
to our patients, which...

1444
00:57:33,356 --> 00:57:35,091
- Yes, you do.
- Yeah.

1445
00:57:35,158 --> 00:57:37,994
I got a weird form
of cancer called...

1446
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,429
- Appendiceal, right?
- Appendiceal cancer.

1447
00:57:39,495 --> 00:57:43,533
- That's where it started.
- The last CAT scan showed

1448
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,334
that the cancer came back.

1449
00:57:46,502 --> 00:57:49,205
You know, it's being
a little more aggressive.

1450
00:57:49,272 --> 00:57:51,073
But I already went
through three rounds of chemo.

1451
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,708
The first two did nothing,

1452
00:57:52,775 --> 00:57:54,677
and the third one
almost killed me.

1453
00:57:54,744 --> 00:57:56,212
Mm-hmm.

1454
00:57:56,279 --> 00:57:57,647
Your mother's really
hanging in there.

1455
00:57:57,713 --> 00:57:59,115
- She really is.
- Yeah.

1456
00:57:59,182 --> 00:58:01,784
- She's gotten sweeter.
- Aww.

1457
00:58:01,851 --> 00:58:04,320
It's hard
taking care of somebody.

1458
00:58:04,387 --> 00:58:07,590
I'm sure it has been hard
with Erich being gone.

1459
00:58:07,657 --> 00:58:09,859
I've really never met
anyone like him.

1460
00:58:09,926 --> 00:58:12,161
- He is a little special.
- Yeah.

1461
00:58:12,228 --> 00:58:15,498
I seriously like her,
and I think it's kind of...

1462
00:58:15,565 --> 00:58:16,999
- [whispering]
- He wouldn't say that otherwise.

1463
00:58:17,066 --> 00:58:18,601
[both laughing]

1464
00:58:18,668 --> 00:58:20,570
I wouldn't be here
and I wouldn't tell you that

1465
00:58:20,636 --> 00:58:23,606
if I didn't think that her
and I had a true connection.

1466
00:58:23,673 --> 00:58:25,975
Our first date,
he really just spoke

1467
00:58:26,042 --> 00:58:29,512
to what a great relationship
that you and Donna have

1468
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:32,515
and how it's been so amazing
to look up to.

1469
00:58:32,582 --> 00:58:34,951
And, like, that's the kind
of love that he wants.

1470
00:58:35,017 --> 00:58:36,853
- And we've been lucky.
- Yeah.

1471
00:58:36,919 --> 00:58:39,722
Watching now how hard
Mom fights for you guys

1472
00:58:39,789 --> 00:58:41,557
and how hard
you've been fighting,

1473
00:58:41,624 --> 00:58:44,393
it's really inspirational.

1474
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,229
My dad really liked Gabby.

1475
00:58:46,295 --> 00:58:48,998
Which is a huge sign
for me too.

1476
00:58:49,065 --> 00:58:51,334
But my mom,
I always want her approval

1477
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,969
and I always need it, so...

1478
00:58:53,035 --> 00:58:55,571
I need her to know how much
I care about it Gabby.

1479
00:58:55,638 --> 00:58:57,039
You know, I wouldn't have
brought her here

1480
00:58:57,106 --> 00:58:58,541
if I didn't have feelings
for her.

1481
00:58:58,608 --> 00:59:00,977
And I would not have put
you guys through this.

1482
00:59:01,043 --> 00:59:02,478
I want you to know that, like,

1483
00:59:02,545 --> 00:59:03,713
you know,
I'm constantly thinking

1484
00:59:03,779 --> 00:59:05,181
about you and Dad, and...

1485
00:59:05,248 --> 00:59:08,150
Has he been doing,
like, similar or...

1486
00:59:08,217 --> 00:59:09,452
- Mm...
- Worse?

1487
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:10,453
Little bit.

1488
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,088
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1489
00:59:12,154 --> 00:59:16,559
But I keep watering
that flower,

1490
00:59:16,626 --> 00:59:17,760
it keeps coming back.

1491
00:59:17,827 --> 00:59:19,228
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1492
00:59:19,295 --> 00:59:22,798
Just seeing how,
like, undyingly you love him

1493
00:59:22,865 --> 00:59:24,500
and everything you've done
for him up to this point,

1494
00:59:24,567 --> 00:59:26,602
it's like, I've kind of modeled

1495
00:59:26,669 --> 00:59:29,205
what I want after the bond
that you and Dad have.

1496
00:59:29,272 --> 00:59:31,941
It's important to have
that feeling,

1497
00:59:32,008 --> 00:59:34,343
like, you couldn't live
without them.

1498
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:36,145
Yeah.

1499
00:59:36,212 --> 00:59:37,947
And we...

1500
00:59:38,014 --> 00:59:39,215
we marry for life.

1501
00:59:39,282 --> 00:59:41,250
Yeah.

1502
00:59:41,317 --> 00:59:43,219
You don't take it lightly.

1503
00:59:43,286 --> 00:59:45,121
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1504
00:59:45,187 --> 00:59:46,689
I know.

1505
00:59:46,756 --> 00:59:49,792
It's an important decision.

1506
00:59:49,859 --> 00:59:51,594
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1507
00:59:51,661 --> 00:59:55,331
[crying softly]

1508
00:59:56,699 --> 00:59:58,668
I know how hard it is
for my family to open up

1509
00:59:58,734 --> 01:00:00,469
and to let people in

1510
01:00:00,536 --> 01:00:04,373
because we're very protective
of each other.

1511
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,109
But my mom, she can see

1512
01:00:07,176 --> 01:00:09,312
Gabby does mean the world
to me now.

1513
01:00:09,378 --> 01:00:12,481
So for me, it was, like, huge.

1514
01:00:12,548 --> 01:00:17,153
Erich, he talks so highly

1515
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:20,323
of you and Allan and Elise.

1516
01:00:20,389 --> 01:00:22,124
I mean, just so amazing.

1517
01:00:22,191 --> 01:00:24,160
And the way he loves
you guys is like,

1518
01:00:24,226 --> 01:00:26,395
that is what I look for
in a partner.

1519
01:00:26,462 --> 01:00:28,798
- Yeah, family means a lot.
- Yeah.

1520
01:00:28,864 --> 01:00:33,035
We just keep trying
to move to the future.

1521
01:00:33,102 --> 01:00:36,973
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

1522
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:40,209
And Allan, seeing him today,
he looks so great,

1523
01:00:40,276 --> 01:00:42,812
and it is such a testament
to the way

1524
01:00:42,878 --> 01:00:44,213
that he's being
taken care of now.

1525
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,850
Yeah, he has an incredible
will to live.

1526
01:00:47,917 --> 01:00:50,620
Yeah, he has
a lot to live for.

1527
01:00:50,686 --> 01:00:51,787
Yeah, 'cause we all love him.

1528
01:00:51,854 --> 01:00:53,356
You can't not love Allan.

1529
01:00:53,422 --> 01:00:56,425
Yeah.

1530
01:00:56,492 --> 01:00:58,127
He's a great guy.

1531
01:00:59,795 --> 01:01:04,200
So I just want to make sure
that you guys...

1532
01:01:06,002 --> 01:01:10,940
If you decide anything,
that commitment to my family

1533
01:01:11,007 --> 01:01:12,375
is really important.

1534
01:01:12,441 --> 01:01:13,542
Yeah.

1535
01:01:13,609 --> 01:01:15,711
We don't give up
on each other ever.

1536
01:01:15,778 --> 01:01:18,414
- Yeah.
- You can't quit.

1537
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:21,784
- Yeah.
- Ever, for anything.

1538
01:01:21,851 --> 01:01:24,053
You know, we've been...
Allan and I have through...

1539
01:01:25,321 --> 01:01:29,725
We'll be married 35 years,
and we've been through a lot.

1540
01:01:31,093 --> 01:01:33,437
You always have to...

1541
01:01:35,431 --> 01:01:39,168
stay together
and be together, always.

1542
01:01:39,235 --> 01:01:40,403
Yeah.

1543
01:01:40,469 --> 01:01:43,372
I hope you know how much
I care about Erich,

1544
01:01:43,439 --> 01:01:45,341
and even coming here now,

1545
01:01:45,408 --> 01:01:47,343
everything makes so much sense.

1546
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:50,179
You can tell how much love
you have for each other.

1547
01:01:50,246 --> 01:01:53,649
And I just feel lucky
to be here, you know, today.

1548
01:01:53,716 --> 01:01:57,320
Erich's mom being
vulnerable with me,

1549
01:01:57,538 --> 01:02:00,790
knowing what she's
going through,

1550
01:02:00,905 --> 01:02:02,358
really meant the world.

1551
01:02:02,425 --> 01:02:04,026
Thank you.

1552
01:02:04,093 --> 01:02:06,295
Today really was so special.

1553
01:02:06,362 --> 01:02:09,098
[indistinct chatter]

1554
01:02:09,165 --> 01:02:11,033
What an amazing example
of love

1555
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,102
his parents have been able
to show.

1556
01:02:13,169 --> 01:02:14,937
I felt so close to them.

1557
01:02:15,004 --> 01:02:18,240
Today with Erich was one of
the best dates I've had so far.

1558
01:02:18,307 --> 01:02:20,209
Thank you for coming today.

1559
01:02:20,276 --> 01:02:22,278
Seeing him with his family,

1560
01:02:22,344 --> 01:02:24,747
that really just made
my feelings

1561
01:02:24,814 --> 01:02:28,117
so much deeper for him,

1562
01:02:28,184 --> 01:02:30,286
and, like, I can't wait
to tell Erich

1563
01:02:30,352 --> 01:02:31,954
how I feel tonight.

1564
01:02:32,021 --> 01:02:34,156
[laughing]

1565
01:02:43,597 --> 01:02:46,566
What do you think about
Bedminster, New Jersey?

1566
01:02:46,651 --> 01:02:48,686
[both laughing]

1567
01:02:48,771 --> 01:02:51,407
Way better
than I expected, honestly.

1568
01:02:51,714 --> 01:02:55,418
Erich, seeing him
with his family today

1569
01:02:55,503 --> 01:02:57,772
and seeing
his family's commitment

1570
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:00,426

because, like, that's all
they want too,

1591
01:03:42,969 --> 01:03:44,303
is for me to be happy

01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:18,581
so yeah, that was pretty cool.

1725
01:10:18,648 --> 01:10:20,550
And it really just is better
every single time

1726
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:21,751
we're together...
I don't know how.

1727
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,519
Since then, like,

1728
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:25,421
I mean, as, like, cheesy
as it's gonna sound,

1729
01:10:25,488 --> 01:10:28,291
like, everything disappears
like, when we're together,

1730
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:30,059
so it's like,
when we started talking,

1731
01:10:30,126 --> 01:10:32,128
- it was like it just flowed...
- Aww, that's nice.

1732
01:10:32,195 --> 01:10:34,096
Yeah, but how much time
do you guys get together?

1733
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:36,132
Each cocktail party, we found
plenty of time together.

1734
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:38,501
Yeah, there's never been
a time we haven't talked.

1735
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,570
Yeah, but aren't there other
guys trying to talking to you?

1736
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:42,205
Aren't they all doing
the same thing?

1737
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:44,640
I mean, how... are they...

1738
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:45,875
They're striking out.

1739
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:47,276
[laughter]

1740
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:49,011
Yeah, no,
I mean, it's definitely...

1741
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,013
It is different.

1742
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,682
So you guys have
a couple more weeks.

1743
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:54,817
- So what do you guys think...
- What do you do next?

1744
01:10:54,884 --> 01:10:56,285
The next two weeks
are gonna be like?

1745
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:58,387
I mean, what are you guys
hoping to find out?

1746
01:10:58,454 --> 01:10:59,655
She'll send
the rest of guys home

1747
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:01,757
and I'll propose to her
in a couple weeks.

1748
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:03,125
[laughs]

1749
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,461
What are you talking about?

1750
01:11:05,528 --> 01:11:07,296
After... after two months?

1751
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:09,098
Yeah. 100%.

1752
01:11:09,165 --> 01:11:10,366
When you know, you know.

1753
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:12,235
[tense music]

1754
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:13,536
We're gonna have to have
a talk.

1755
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:16,272
- Okay.
- Man to man.

1756
01:11:16,339 --> 01:11:18,574
I was not expecting my dad

1757
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:21,978
to be really stringent
with his questions.

1758
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:25,047
Clearly, he's really
skeptical about the situation.

1759
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:27,350
I'm gonna take you outside
and we're gonna have a talk.

1760
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:29,518
- Shall we?
- Yeah, let's do it.

1761
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:33,422
I want Rachel to be able
to see herself in this family.

1762
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:36,058
But I'm, like,
to some degree afraid

1763
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,016
because I do want
that stamp of approval.

1764
01:11:39,101 --> 01:11:40,479
I got a lot of questions.

1765
01:11:40,564 --> 01:11:42,180
- First question is,
- Lay 'em on me.

1766
01:11:42,265 --> 01:11:44,166
It's been
a very short period of time.

1767
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:45,568
Mm-hmm.

1768
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,870
Do you really think
this is where you want to be?

1769
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:50,473
- Yeah. Without a doubt.
- Really? Why?

1770
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:55,111
I mean, how... how,
in just five weeks...

1771
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:56,612
do you know enough about her?

1772
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:58,147
I know the important stuff.

1773
01:11:58,214 --> 01:12:01,150
We talked about stuff
that we want for the future

1774
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:05,563
and stuff we're insecure about,
and every reassurance

1775
01:12:05,648 --> 01:12:08,291
that I've felt like I needed,
I'm getting out of her.

1776
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:11,627
You feel like you've had
that much time to connect,

1777
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:14,130
- like, at different levels?
- Yeah.

1778
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:17,967
I just have a hard time
believing that what you can do

1779
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:20,303
on a whirlwind fairy tale trip

1780
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:22,471
is really gonna prepare you
for marriage.

1781
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:25,608
And I just want to make sure
your head's in the right place.

1782
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:28,244
And this whole fairy tale thing
and everything

1783
01:12:28,311 --> 01:12:30,913
has us more...
Probably more nervous

1784
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:32,281
than you are, you know?

1785
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:35,151
Because we're like,
this is, you know, our kid,

1786
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:38,654
and we want to see you be
happy the rest of your life.

1787
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,925
It's just been an honor
to get to know him.

1788
01:12:42,992 --> 01:12:45,995
I really just feel like
I've never met anyone like him,

1789
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:47,596
so I thank you for sharing him.

1790
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:50,032
So what do you think
Tino's best traits are?

1791
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:54,670
He is seriously so positive,
and his outlook on life

1792
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:58,307
is truly something
I've never seen anyone have.

1793
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,608
He was like,
"Yeah, you know, I give...

1794
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:00,843
I give blood all the time."

1795
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:02,011
And I was like, "Well, why?"

1796
01:13:02,078 --> 01:13:03,512
He's like,
"Well, there's a shortage."

1797
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:05,014
And I remember just being like,
"Oh, my gosh.

1798
01:13:05,081 --> 01:13:08,017
Like, he just cares so much.
He's so giving."

1799
01:13:08,084 --> 01:13:09,919
If you think you met him
outside of...

1800
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:11,153
So this is not real.

1801
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,688
- This is not real.
- Well, it is.

1802
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:14,924
Well, but it's not, like,
how you normally meet people

1803
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,425
- and how you normally do things.
- Of course. Of course.

1804
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,794
- You're in this insulated...
- Mm-hmm.

1805
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:20,296
- I guess, bubble.
- Yeah.

1806
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:22,732
So you have a huge decision
coming up.

1807
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:25,134
Mm-hmm. Exactly.

1808
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:27,305
So I've gotta figure out,
in a week or two,

1809
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:30,373
if I'm mending a broken heart
or planning a wedding.

1810
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:31,374
Yeah.

1811
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,875
- And I guess you do too.
- Yeah.

1812
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:36,045
Talking to Tino's mom,
I feel like

1813
01:13:36,112 --> 01:13:38,881
she's just skeptical
about the whole thing.

1814
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:41,450
How much time do you get
to figure this out, though?

1815
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:42,618
This is a big decision for you.

1816
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:43,819
Right now,
it's about two weeks left.

1817
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:47,022
- Wow.
- She grilled my ass.

1818
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:50,292
And now I'm, like, scared
to talk to his dad.

1819
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:54,730
This has hit me,
like, really hard.

1820
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:56,031
Okay.

1821
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,033
I guess my first question
would be is,

1822
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,136
how can you make a connection
that quickly?

1823
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:02,238
You gotta appreciate
the skepticism.

1824
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:04,073
Oh, no, completely.

1825
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,442
It is extremely expedited,

1826
01:14:06,509 --> 01:14:10,312
but I think we are able to talk
about really serious things

1827
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:13,482
really quickly and see
if we want similar things,

1828
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:16,152
if we line up with our morals.

1829
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:18,988
I have trouble wrapping
my head around the fact

1830
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:22,725
that this could happen
that quickly.

1831
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:25,895
And so tell me,
what's Tino like?

1832
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:28,931
Convince me that you know him,
the real Tino.

1833
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:31,200
I think it's just the way
he looks at life

1834
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:33,235
and his positive outlook.

1835
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:35,271
I feel like I have
so much to learn from him

1836
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:37,373
and he's so humble and caring

1837
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,375
and people just gravitate
towards him.

1838
01:14:39,442 --> 01:14:40,810
[sighs]

1839
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:43,345
Don't take this the wrong way.
It just sounds...

1840
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:44,914
I mean, you're saying
all the right things,

1841
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,916
and it's like,
that's all great,

1842
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:49,585
but at least in our mind...

1843
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:52,021
From 20,000 feet away,

1844
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:55,132
we see it as, like,
this fairy tale thing.

1845
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,127
Like I said,
I'm looking out for him.

1846
01:14:58,194 --> 01:15:00,262
- Yeah.
- It's nothing against you.

1847
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:01,564
I'm just making sure

1848
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,065
that he's making
the right choice

1849
01:15:03,132 --> 01:15:06,135
and that it's the right match.

1850
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:07,403
Yeah.

1851
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:09,505
Like, I genuinely almost cried

1852
01:15:09,572 --> 01:15:11,640
because I thought it was
going that bad with his dad

1853
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:13,843
and I didn't know
how to answer his questions.

1854
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:15,744
How can you talk
about Tino this way,

1855
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:19,582
but there's still other people,
you're obviously exploring

1856
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:22,017
those potential relationships?

1857
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:26,188
I literally was like, "Okay,
this is actually about to end."

1858
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:30,226
And I want to see him
fall for the right person.

1859
01:15:35,262 --> 01:15:38,465
So how far have you and Tino
talked about, like...

1860
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:41,453
let's say he's there
at the end of this.

1861
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:44,274
I mean, are you expecting
an engagement?

1862
01:15:44,359 --> 01:15:47,095
What's the plan?

1863
01:15:47,162 --> 01:15:50,298
Yeah, no,
I'm looking for an engagement.

1864
01:15:50,365 --> 01:15:53,168
And he, I mean, has told me

1865
01:15:53,235 --> 01:15:55,116
that that's something
he's ready for.

1866
01:15:55,201 --> 01:15:57,935
He definitely, I think,
is a little bit slower

1867
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,357
with... his feelings
and he definitely

1868
01:16:00,442 --> 01:16:02,010
holds back a little bit more.

1869
01:16:02,077 --> 01:16:04,346
So I'm definitely
kind of just waiting

1870
01:16:04,412 --> 01:16:07,916
to see where he's at
with all this, but yeah,

1871
01:16:07,983 --> 01:16:10,152
that's definitely something
I'm looking for.

1872
01:16:10,218 --> 01:16:13,755
- No, I mean...
- [sighs]

1873
01:16:13,822 --> 01:16:15,290
I don't want to beat
a dead horse.

1874
01:16:15,357 --> 01:16:18,960
The hardest part

And then, in two weeks...

2035
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:48,970
Bienvenidos!

2036
01:22:49,055 --> 01:22:51,324
Gabby and Rachel take
their journey for love

2037
01:22:51,409 --> 01:22:52,409
to Mexico.

2038
01:22:52,529 --> 01:22:54,164
I am in love,

2039
01:22:54,249 --> 01:22:56,585
and I've never been
this happy.

2040
01:22:56,672 --> 01:22:58,540
This is the moment
during Clayton's season

2041
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:00,158
where everything went haywire.

2042
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:02,612
Everything went off the wall.

2043
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:04,913
The last thing your dad said
to me, like, was,

2044
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,148
they don't like me.

2045
01:23:06,215 --> 01:23:07,416
I'm scared to move forward

2046
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:09,084
because of what happened
at Hometowns.

2047
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:12,020
After Fantasy Suite,
everything took, like, a 180.

2048
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:14,189
That was the last thing
I could've ever expected.

2049
01:23:14,256 --> 01:23:16,425
I'm picturing the girl
that, like, I'm in love with

2050
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:18,126
doing that with somebody else.

2051
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:19,127
It, like, crushes me.

2052
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:21,396
He said he can't love me.

2053
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:25,200
It's like, am I too broken
for anyone to love?

2054
01:23:25,267 --> 01:23:27,790
Gabby will not
be joining you.

2055
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:29,777
You're gonna be
the only Bachelorette here.

2056
01:23:29,881 --> 01:23:32,584
I'm struggling,
because I want this to work,

2057
01:23:32,808 --> 01:23:34,610
so it's hard
when I've given him

2058
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:36,400
nothing but the best.

2059
01:23:36,485 --> 01:23:38,153
It's all coming up

2060
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:39,973
on "The Bachelorette."

Is your father a pilot,
or did you...

2063
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:45,087
No, my dad's actually
an engineer.

2064
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:47,456
He always kind of has been
interested in aviation,

2065
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,324
- but yeah.
- Right.

2066
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:50,993
We always have been
in our family.

2067
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:52,814
When did you start flying?

2068
01:23:52,914 --> 01:23:54,816
When I was 17.

2069
01:23:54,901 --> 01:23:56,147
Do you have
your pilot's license?

2070
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:57,966
No. I could've gotten it,

2071
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,908
- if I was more dedicated.
- Yeah.

2072
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:01,929
Look, I failed
out of junior college.

2073
01:24:02,014 --> 01:24:04,550
And, um,
I wasn't even on drugs.

2075
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:07,309
I'm just not good
at studying.

2076
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:08,810
See, the more I talk,

2077
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,212
I feel like Zach
just brought me home

2078
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:12,347
so everyone could get
their pilot's license.

2079
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:14,216
That's right.

He's got quite a presence,
doesn't he?

2082
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:21,456
- He does.
- He's got a big heart.

2083
01:24:21,523 --> 01:24:23,225
You know, he comes
from a great family.

I do need one thing from you.
