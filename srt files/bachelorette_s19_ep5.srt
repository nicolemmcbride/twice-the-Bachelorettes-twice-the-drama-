1
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:02,970
- Tonight on
"The Bachelorette"...

2
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,110
- We're gonna get weird.

3
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,745
Do you like it?

4
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,648
- You impress me.
- No, you impress me.

5
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:15,883
- Gabby's, hands down,

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,227
the coolest girlfriend
I ever had.

7
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,052
I love that I can just
be myself around you.

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,320
- Me too.

9
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,855
- Every moment I spend
with Rachel,

10
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,090
the connection is just there.

11
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,158
I love that feeling
of seeing you smile.

12
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,661
- My connections
are so much stronger

13
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,429
than I ever thought possible.

14
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,698
- I'll take any piece of you
any day.

15
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,434
- I feel so happy.

16
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,037
- I care about Rachel,

17
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,106
but I can't put
my initial feelings

18
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,641
for Gabby aside.

19
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,743
This is humiliating.

20
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,811
- Yeah.
- Humiliating.

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,580
Oh!

22
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,015
- There's Logan coming in.

23
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,349
That's just a huge wild card.

24
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,484
- Is Gabby questioning

25
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,052
her connections
with the rest of us?

26
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,763
- That's, like, what's kind of
going through my head.

27
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,188
- Actions carry weight,

28
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,695
and you can't do something
like that.

29
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,125
It's gonna cause a stir.

30
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,126
Oh.

31
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,227
- Oh.
- Whoa.

32
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:02,763
- I don't want
to do this anymore.

33
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,634
- It all starts right now.

34
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:25,786
- Waking up this morning,
I'm so excited.

35
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:30,891
We're sailing to another
beautiful city in Europe:

36
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,826
Bruges, Belgium.

37
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:36,163
I'm just excited to explore
a new country

38
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,432
with my group of guys.

39
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,170
I think, ever since we
started traveling,

40
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,005
we've all been
in really good spirits

41
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,674
and truly here to find love.

42
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,476
Thank you.

43
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,980
I just hope that we keep
kind of riding this high.

44
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,215
We are very much in the middle
of this journey,

45
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,483
and I'm developing

46
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,019
deep feelings
for these men already.

47
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,421
But as my connections
get deeper,

48
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,490
I never know who's
going to surprise me.

49
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,231
- Dude, look how beautiful
these towns look.

50
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,538
- I'm so excited
to be in Belgium.

51
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,641
I've never been,
and I'm really excited to try

52
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,776
some real Belgian chocolate.

53
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:26,580
There are canals,
little alleyways,

54
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:31,585
horse-drawn carriages,
and it's just so romantic.

55
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,153
It really is
out of a fairy tale.

56
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,024
Moving into this week,

57
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,093
I am excited for a fresh start.

58
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,130
The past couple weeks have
been really difficult for me

59
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,741
because I definitely feel
like there's been

60
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,199
a lot of rejection.

61
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,436
So I do want to put that
behind me.

62
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,305
I have a group date today,

63
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:56,710
and I feel really confident in
the guys that are here for me.

64
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,912
They step up when I ask them to.

65
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,347
I just only hope that this week,

66
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,350
they can continue
to show up for me.

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,197
- It was tough seeing Rachel
upset, you know,

68
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,090
over the past couple days.

69
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,192
You know, as a group,
we gotta make her feel good.

70
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,828
- I think it comes down
to all of us showing

71
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,563
how much we want to be here.

72
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,632
There's not one guy
around here that I don't think

73
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,567
is gonna do that.

74
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,703
- This has been a hard
couple weeks for Rachel,

75
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,640
and we all want her to smile
and enjoy her time,

76
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,608
and, like, I want those things
for her too.

77
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,944
Date card.

78
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:34,114
- But that doesn't change
what I feel,

79
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,651
which is I feel for Gabby.

80
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:42,522
And I'm just ping-ponging this
in my head constantly.

81
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,926
- Tino.

82
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,228
Zach.

83
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,896
Meatball.

84
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,099
Ethan.

85
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,334
Tyler.

86
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,140
Logan.

87
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,909
"How sweet it is
to be loved by you...

88
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,644
Love, Rachel."

89
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,914
- Usually, seeing your name
on a date card

90
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,783
is instant gratification, right?

91
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,487
But this one's kind of
mixed feelings for me.

92
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,888
But...
- Yeah.

93
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,599
It's nice to see your name
on the date card,

94
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,725
but you obviously kind of hope

95
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,861
that you were the one person
not on the date card.

96
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,829
But congrats to you, Aven.

97
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,397
Looks like you got
the one-on-one.

98
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,800
- Yeah. That's exciting.

99
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,369
- For this whole journey,
I've gotten to know Rachel

100
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,304
as this wonderful person,

101
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,841
but the worst thing I could do
is get to a point

102
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:38,879
where relationships
are at a more serious level

103
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,180
and then bring this up.

104
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,451
Before this group date
takes off,

105
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,520
I need to talk to Rachel.

106
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:50,490
I need to tell her I can't go,
and I need to tell her why.

107
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:53,493
I have no clue how she'll react,

108
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,263
but maybe she'll understand.

109
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,631
I'm praying she does.

110
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,603
Hi.

111
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,738
- Oh, hi.

112
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,640
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

113
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,542
- Sorry for the surprise, but...
- Yeah.

114
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,153
- Uh, mind if I come in?
- Do you want to come in?

115
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,511
- Thank you, thank you.

116
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,256
I wanted to have a quick talk,
if you had some time.

117
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,614
- Yeah.

118
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,949
- How are you doing?
- I'm good.

119
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,050
How are you?

120
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,351
- I'm good.

121
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,120
Um...

122
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,464
I've, like, never really
gotten a chance

123
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,523
to tell you that, like, uh...

124
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,492
Um...

125
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,594
like, how honored I am,

126
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,197
like, whenever you put
a rose on me.

127
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,533
- This feels really good
to hear you say.

128
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,601
- Yeah. Um...

129
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,513
But I feel like something's
kind of been holding me back

130
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,973
a little bit,
a feeling that I've kind of

131
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,410
been anchored down by a bit.
- Yeah.

132
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:47,380
- And like, at the beginning
of this journey,

133
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,749
first group date,
going over to your house,

134
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,294
you and I shared, like,
a real connection.

135
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:52,652
- Mm-hmm.

136
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:56,122
- And I also got to talk
with Gabby.

137
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,224
- Mm-hmm.

138
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,825
- And me and Gabby

139
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,760
also had a strong connection.

140
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,162
- Yeah.

141
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,630
- And at the end of the night,

142
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,465
I originally thought
that I was going

143
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,901
to receive a rose from Gabby.
- Okay.

144
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,871
- And it's been hard for me
moving forward

145
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,607
to kind of forget
about that connection.

146
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,909
And when I read
that date card today,

147
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:20,247
I felt that everyone else
on that card

148
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,850
was sure
that you were going to be

149
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:27,387
someone who they could end up
with at the end of this.

150
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:28,455
- Mm-hmm.

151
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,757
- Well, I still had reservations

152
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:31,758
and feelings for Gabby.

153
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,360
- Mm-hmm.

154
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:37,097
- And that being said, like,

155
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,199
I can't go today.
- Okay.

156
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:44,404
- And I'm going to have
to, like, step away from...

157
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,040
From pursuing things with you.

158
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,521
I look at myself in the mirror,
and I'm like, "I'm a fool."

159
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,347
Like, look at you.
- Uh-huh.

160
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,183
- I'm surprised
that you even gave me a chance

161
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,952
in the first place.
- Yeah.

162
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,821
I mean, you accepted
so many roses from me,

163
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,391
when the whole time,
you really didn't

164
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,926
even want to spend time?
- No.

165
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,228
- Like, I appreciate
you bringing this to me.

166
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:11,865
If that's where
your heart is, like,

167
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,400
I appreciate you telling me.

168
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,168
I just wish
it would have been earlier.

169
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,115
- It's also not something
that I've been sure of

170
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,605
until recently.
- Yeah.

171
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,073
Like...

172
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,742
of course,
the first thing I think

173
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,169
when this first popped
into my head

174
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,046
was like, "You're crazy.

175
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,315
Like, look at Rachel.
Look at who she is."

176
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,849
- You don't have
to explain that.

177
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,052
You don't have to keep going.
I got it.

178
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,195
You know,
I'm not trying to be mean.

179
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,488
I just... I get it.
- Okay.

180
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,490
- Obviously,
this is tough to hear,

181
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,826
and no one really
wants to hear this, so...

182
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,629
- Yeah
- Mm-hmm.

183
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,532
- Um... thank you.
- Yeah.

184
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,536
I really thought going this
far, he wouldn't have flipped.

185
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,338
Like, looking forward, like,

186
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,573
I was really hopeful that things

187
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,175
could pick up with Logan and I,

188
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,910
'cause I think he's, like,
a great guy.

189
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:57,911
I'm attracted to him.

190
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:58,979
Like, I did give him

191
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,547
the first group date rose,

192
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:01,657
and this whole time,
he was like,

193
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,615
"How do I tell Rachel

194
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,985
I don't even want to be here?"

195
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,519
Well, good luck.

196
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,254
I'll walk you out.

197
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,526
Everyone is leaving me.

198
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:17,897
It's just like, the rejection,
that just feels really awful,

199
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,134
and it almost feels like
I'm doing something wrong.

200
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,805
I don't know.

201
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,708
Something's clearly wrong
with me, but I don't know.

202
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,323
I mean, no one can sit here
and honestly tell me

203
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,847
I didn't fail.

204
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,558
It's just... this was
supposed to be, like,

205
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,451
my time to, like, find someone,

206
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,222
and everyone's rejected me
week after week after week.

207
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:46,259
There hasn't been one week
someone's stayed all week.

208
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,496
I just don't even know
why I'm here.

209
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:54,267
Everyone's that's not
is gonna leave at some point.

210
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,136
And I feel like now
is the perfect time,

211
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,905
so why don't they all
just leave?

212
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:02,976
Then at least I don't
have to say that I quit.

213
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,512
I don't wanna do this anymore.

214
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,954
- Dude.
- Wow.

215
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,723
We're in Bruges, baby.

216
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,258
Oh, it's so beautiful here.

217
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,793
I love this place already.

218
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,895
The smell of Belgian
chocolates and waffles,

219
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,129
the beautiful castles,

220
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,331
the beautiful horses
that we see.

221
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,599
Hi, horses.

222
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,569
- I just knocked it
out of the park

223
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,505
on a one-on-one in Paris
with Rachel last week.

224
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,340
Now it's time
to show that, like,

225
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,009
I can make her feel special

226
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,144
and on top of the world
on a group date.

227
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,452
- Yeah!
- Oh, they're in chocolate!

228
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,053
- I'm excited to see Rachel

229
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,189
and kind of enjoy the day
with her.

230
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,058
You know, see her laugh,
see her smile.

231
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,793
- Oh!

232
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,004
- Logan's not with us right now,

233
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,529
and I don't know why.

234
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,532
But one less guy does give me
more of an opportunity

235
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,001
to talk with Rachel,
and I can't wait

236
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,603
to spend more time with her.

237
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,181
I just don't know what to do.

238
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,418
My guys just, like, keep getting

239
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:21,087
the short end of the stick
constantly.

240
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,165
Like, I feel bad that they
have to keep dealing with this

241
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,758
week after week,
but I'm not ready right now

242
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,627
to just go on a group date
and act like

243
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,362
I don't feel like a huge loser.

244
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,698
- Wow.

245
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,466
- And, like,
the worst part about Logan

246
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,111
is, like, the whole time,
he was just seeing

247
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,937
how far he could get until
he could switch to Gabby.

248
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,874
Logan, how many weeks
were you gonna go

249
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,710
before you did this,
when you knew apparently

250
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,812
at that first group date?

251
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,314
Why did you accept my rose?

252
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,250
This is two weeks
before Hometowns,

253
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,316
this is happening.

254
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,119
Like, I should have

255
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,522
at least seven guys
who want to be here for me,

256
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,689
and I don't.

257
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,127
Like, I'm literally just, like,

258
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,264
such a failure
as a Bachelorette.

259
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,206
- Hey.

260
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,550
Can I come in and talk
with you for a second?

261
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:15,842
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

262
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,077
- Thanks, Jess.

263
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,379
- Well...

264
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,518
- Talk to me. What's going on?

265
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,755
- I mean,
it seems like I thought

266
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,591
we would be past the point
of people changing their mind,

267
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,059
and we're not.

268
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,762
And it just doesn't seem
out of the realm of possibility

269
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,897
for it to continue to happen.

270
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,533
And not even just, like, Gabby,
but just for people

271
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,834
to change their mind about me.

272
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,102
- Mm.

273
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,505
- And it's just scary,
because it's like,

274
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,775
how could I not keep expecting
it to happen at this point?

275
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,243
- Yeah.
How is it affecting you?

276
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,078
Like, how are you now
towards the other men?

277
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,747
- I definitely feel like
I have walls going up,

278
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:58,084
and it's just unfair
to the guys who are here.

279
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,919
They have to keep
picking me back up

280
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,555
'cause I keep having, like,
these really bad days,

281
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,290
but I feel like I'm just, like,

282
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:07,827
getting dealt
really bad cards, like,

283
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,663
pretty much in a row,
so it's, like,

284
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,667
hard to keep having momentum.

285
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,403
I feel like I'm, like, failing

286
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,073
in the role as the Bachelorette.

287
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,182
- You cannot be the
perfect Bachelorette.

288
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,183
- Yeah.
- I wanted to be

289
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,351
the perfect Bachelor.

290
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,418
It's impossible,

291
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,387
Rachel, it's impossible,
all right?

292
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,723
We get put into situations

293
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,958
that we never could have
prepared for.

294
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,227
All we can do, all you can do,

295
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,895
is make the best decisions
in real time

296
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,264
using your intuition.

297
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,899
Even though you're going
through a storm right now,

298
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,736
the hope is for you
to fall in love with someone

299
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,805
who loves you back for you,
and they get down on one knee,

300
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,707
and that is still
totally in play.

301
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,143
Yeah.

302
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,478
It's just, like, hard.

303
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,546
Like, I really appreciate
everything you're saying.

304
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,681
I do, it's just...

305
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,983
It's tough right now to...

306
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,923
- I know.

307
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,593
- Like, I shouldn't
be feeling this sad.

308
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,170
- No, there's no playbook
for this thing.

309
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,129
- I know.

310
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,064
I wish there was.
- Me too.

311
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,534
I'd love to give you mine,
but all of our journeys

312
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,645
are totally different, right?
- I know.

313
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,103
I know.

314
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,730
- So, as you know,
the guys are in town.

315
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:26,873
- Yeah.

316
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,083
- There's supposed
to be a date today.

317
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,143
- Yeah.

318
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,011
- What do you want to do?

319
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,860
- I just want to do something...
Like, see her,

320
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,729
because that's why we're here.

321
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,531
- I can't wait to see Rachel.

322
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,932
I haven't seen her all day.

323
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,168
I figured I'd see her by now,
but I don't know

324
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,554
how much longer
we got to go here.

325
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,605
- What's up, guys?
- Hey.

326
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,773
How you doing?
- What's up?

327
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,009
- Jesse!
- How's it going, Jesse?

328
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,111
- Fellas, good to see you all.

329
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,113
- Good to see you.
- Welcome to Bruges.

330
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,482
I know you guys were excited
to see Rachel and not me,

331
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,285
but I did have to come here
to tell you that,

332
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,021
unfortunately,
Rachel has decided

333
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,856
to cancel today's date.

334
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,103
Some stuff went down,
and she doesn't feel like

335
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,105
she's in the right mind-set
to go on this group date

336
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,498
with you today in Bruges.

337
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:28,568
But it doesn't mean she doesn't
want to see you all.

338
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:32,105
So Rachel is going to see you
at tonight's after party.

339
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,240
So head on back to the ship
and get ready.

340
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,509
Rachel will see you there
tonight.

341
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,378
Gentlemen, again,
I'm very sorry.

342
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,380
See you in a bit.

343
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,148
- Damn.

344
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,951
- I'm feeling
really disappointed.

345
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,520
I want to enjoy these moments
with Rachel.

346
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,922
And, you know, every single day

347
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,692
I don't get a chance
to spend with her, you know,

348
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,436
those are memories
that I miss out on with her.

349
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,864
- Now we don't really even get
to, like, share this with her.

350
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,866
So let's just bring
our A-game tonight,

351
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:03,403
cheer her up, keep it
as low drama as we can.

352
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,871
I'm really bummed.

353
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,974
I just really wanted to be able
to experience Belgium

354
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,243
with Rachel, because we had
such an extraordinary time

355
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,477
in Paris.

356
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,514
And for anybody else
to bum her out

357
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,916
and it affect,
like, an experience

358
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,452
I can have with her,
I feel stripped

359
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,722
of a wonderful opportunity
with my future wife.

360
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,757
- It's very frustrating.

361
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:27,693
Just, like, we wanted to have
a really great week with her,

362
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,029
and this is not a great start.

363
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,698
So who knows what's
going to happen next?

364
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:49,215
- I just did the daunting task
of telling Rachel

365
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,585
that I've wanted
to pursue Gabby.

366
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,488
I feel terrible.

367
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:59,192
But I couldn't continue on
with the charade,

368
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,161
and now I have to tell Gabby.

369
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,031
The light
at the end of the tunnel

370
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,633
would be the off chance

371
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,237
that Gabby feels
the same thing I feel,

372
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,473
and I can stay.

373
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,642
It seems unlikely,
and I'm aware of that.

374
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:20,246
And if I end up going home,
it'll be for a good reason,

375
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,850
because I actually went after
what my heart wanted.

376
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,156
Hi.

377
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,724
- Hi.
- How are you?

378
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,725
- Good, how are you?

379
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,494
- Good. Um...

380
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,863
- Yeah. Come in.
- Yeah.

381
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,165
- I'm sure you're surprised
to see me.

382
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:40,166
- I am.

383
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,601
- Yeah.

384
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,602
Do you think we can sit down?

385
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,070
- Yeah, of course.

386
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:49,342
- Um...
- How's it going?

387
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,408
- It's going good.

388
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,411
I've actually been wanting

389
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,813
to talk to you for a while.

390
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,814
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

391
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,148
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...

392
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,684
when I met you at your mansion,
like, I was like,

393
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,420
on fire for you
that first night,

394
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:05,124
and I was hopeful
that you would give me a rose.

395
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,893
- Yeah.

396
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,194
- And I got one from Rachel,

397
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,029
and we've had some great
moments...

398
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,998
- Yeah.

399
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:17,403
- But I've come back to, like,
thinking about you.

400
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,308
And it's something
that's gotten in the way.

401
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,477
- Yeah.
- Um...

402
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,347
So this morning, I had
a conversation with Rachel.

403
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,515
- Okay.

404
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,484
- And I told her

405
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:36,155
that, like, I needed
to step away from dating her.

406
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,824
- How... how did she take it?

407
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,661
- I think she understood,
but she was frustrated.

408
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,895
- Yeah.

409
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:45,498
- Which, like,
I would never blame her for.

410
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,166
And I know you guys
are so close.

411
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,101
- Yeah.
- And...

412
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,771
I'm not here to, like,
look for a response.

413
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,640
I'm not asking for an answer
or anything like that.

414
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,776
- Yeah.
- But I did want to say it.

415
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,811
- Yeah, no, I appreciate it,
and I feel like

416
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,846
I can just be straight up
with you.

417
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,282
- Yeah.
- But it was kind of...

418
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,851
You were pretty much
our only overlap,

419
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,787
you know,
like, in the beginning.

420
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,624
Like, you were the only one
that both of us

421
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,994
felt like we could comfortably
say, you know, "I'm into him."

422
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,697
And then that night
when you came over,

423
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,199
and you had kissed both of us,
and it sounded like

424
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,935
you and her had a really great
conversation,

425
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,171
I, like, completely backed away.

426
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,506
But that's when
I was like, dang.

427
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,809
Like, I, you know,
am very interested,

428
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,744
and it might not be
as easy for me

429
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,846
to let go of my feelings.

430
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,315
But we are on
our separate journeys now,

431
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,884
and I just want to check in
with Rachel,

432
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,186
but yeah.
- Absolutely.

433
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,321
I'm just glad
you got to, like, sit here

434
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:43,389
and, like, hear me out.

435
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,857
- Yeah, absolutely.

436
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,092
- Thank you.

437
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,828
- This, like, is my worst
nightmare, you know,

438
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,163
on the outside of things.

439
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,698
- Like, me being here.
- Yeah, you...

440
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:53,976
- I'm your worst nightmare.
- Yeah.

441
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,235
- Good, thank you.

442
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,671
Not really what I was
looking for, but...

443
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,407
- Right, but it's not you,
it's just I want to always,

444
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,276
always, always put
my friends first.

445
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:07,279
But... and I am, like, and I have
been interested in you.

446
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,349
It just... I was surprised
to see you, obviously.

447
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,717
I just kept looking at you.

448
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,619
- I wasn't sure if
you'd remember my name.

449
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,955
It was, like,
such a risk for me.

450
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,023
Yeah.

451
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,367
- You would, like,
tell me, like,

452
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,992
"Oh, I have fresh towels.
I'm good."

453
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,560
- Right.
Like, "Not today."

454
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:22,561
- Yeah.

455
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,663
Not interested.

456
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,165
But yeah,
I'm glad we got to talk.

457
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:29,101
It feels a lot better already,
just being honest.

458
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,169
- Yeah, totally.

459
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,971
- All right.

460
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,339
- I can walk you out.

461
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,740
- Okay.

462
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,543
I feel good about that.

463
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,345
After talking to her
for 20 seconds,

464
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,048
I realized why I was doing
all this, you know?

465
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,417
- Bye.

466
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:49,855
- But my future at this point
is completely unknown.

467
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,825
Now I'm moving
into this no man's land.

468
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,894
I'm not in Rachel's group
anymore,

469
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,663
and I'm not in Gabby's group.

470
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,665
I could be going home tomorrow.

471
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,036
I think the conversation
between Gabby and Rachel

472
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,205
will be a difficult one.

473
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,406
- Hi.

474
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:08,774
- But I would like to think

475
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,710
they both want
what's best for each other,

476
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,212
and maybe I'm part of that.

477
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,318
- What is going on?

478
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,253
- Did you hear? Do you know?
- Yeah. Yeah.

479
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,955
Well, he came to talk to me.
- Okay.

480
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,599
I get he's following his heart,
but I'm like,

481
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,292
how many roses
were you gonna take

482
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,294
until you were, like,
gonna jump?

483
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,329
Like, where was like, the line?
- Yeah.

484
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,132
- Like, was he genuinely
trying and then, like,

485
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,334
decided he couldn't,
or was it like,

486
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,921
"I just want to see
how far I can get"?

487
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,070
- Yeah.
- And that's, like,

488
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,538
where I was at,
and now, of course,

489
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,507
he had to do that
before the date...

490
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,576
- Yeah. I know, I hate that.

491
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,087
That was the first thing
I thought of, too,

492
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,146
and I can't imagine
having those feelings,

493
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,380
like, before a date.

494
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,416
But how did you feel
when you, like, went?

495
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,751
- I didn't go.

496
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:56,188
- There was no date?
- No.

497
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,524
I, like, couldn't,
'cause I asked these guys

498
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,427
to give me 100%
every single time.

499
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,697
I can't go in there being like,
"Oh, someone else left,"

500
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:05,941
and I feel like a failure.
- Yeah.

501
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,008
- It's, like,
"The Bachelorette."

502
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,567
'Cause it's like,
Logan just came in

503
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,336
and dumped me
for another Bachelorette.

504
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,271
Like, this is humiliating.

505
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,006
- Yeah.
- Humiliating.

506
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,741
And so, like, I'm gonna try
to go tonight,

507
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,610
but, like,
I just still don't feel great.

508
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,412
- Like, I would honestly feel
the same way.

509
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,981
- Yeah.

510
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,592
But, like, what do you...
How are you feeling?

511
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,385
'Cause, like, I want you to get
what you need out of this,

512
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,053
if that's something
you want to pursue.

513
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,022
- I don't ever want to put you
in a place

514
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:33,993
by, like, having to see him
or, you know...

515
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,695
- I don't want you to be
thinking about me so much

516
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,540
that you, like, if there...
You genuinely think

517
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:40,108
something could be there,
that you lose it.

518
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,309
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

519
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,003
- I think the only reason
I would agree

520
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,438
is to, like, explore it more.
- Mm-hmm.

521
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,274
- But, like, you don't deserve

522
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,610
feeling like these guys
aren't here for you,

523
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,546
because I see the way
they look at you,

524
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,981
and I know how crazy
they are about you,

525
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,616
and like,
I want you to see that.

526
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,018
- Yeah.

527
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,829
I appreciate that
the first thing you thought of

528
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,354
was to come to me,
and I love you.

529
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,990
- I love you. Mm.

530
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,426
- I think Gabby
is interested in Logan.

531
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,861
Okay, bye.

532
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:13,265
But I just don't think
Logan is trustworthy.

533
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,668
He strung me along for weeks,

534
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,003
and I just really
don't want that

535
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,638
to happen to Gabby in the future

536
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:23,075
and for her to feel
as hurt as I do right now.

537
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:25,244
At the end of the day,
I'm gonna support her

538
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:27,580
no matter what,
but I really hope

539
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,481
Gabby sends him home.

540
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,730
- I was really excited to spend
some time with Rachel.

541
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,432
That was some place
that I really wanted

542
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,100
to experience with her.
- Mm-hmm.

543
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,735
- And I didn't get a chance
to do that.

544
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,637
But, you know, going in tonight,

545
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,340
you just gotta make up
for lost time.

546
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,275
- Obviously, without Logan here,

547
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,878
there's some unanswered
questions, right?

548
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,881
So, you know, hopefully
she can address those

549
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,282
if she's comfortable.

550
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,584
You know, good news is
there is a rose on the table,

551
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:07,953
so now that there's
only five of us,

552
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,155
I think we can all get
some quality time with her.

553
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,625
- What we have to do is just
be there to listen to her,

554
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,393
and be there to support her.

555
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,595
- Anyone nervous?
- Yeah.

556
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:19,531
I just don't know what,
you know, happened at all.

557
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,408
- I mean, everyone just
put two and two together

558
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:30,743
that something bad happened,

559
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,244
because she's not feeling well.

560
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:33,946
I don't know
how it's gonna turn out.

561
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,915
I don't imagine
it's gonna go well.

562
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,350
- First of all, I...

563
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:43,222
I want to really
apologize to you all.

564
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,659
This morning,
Logan did come to my room.

565
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:50,195
He told me that he
is interested in pursuing

566
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,631
a relationship with Gabby.

567
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:57,102
And this is something
that Gabby and I...

568
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,837
It was kind of our biggest fear.

569
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,974
But I thought we were farther
enough in this process

570
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,643
where this wasn't gonna happen.

571
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,914
It's just tough, like,
the constant rejection.

572
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:12,284
And I do want to, like,
open the floor...

573
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:14,029
Like, if you guys, like,
don't want to be here,

574
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:16,889
like, you do not have to be.

575
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,625
If anyone, you know,
has any concerns

576
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,794
or wants to leave just...

577
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,262
Obviously let me know.

578
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:24,596
I'd rather know now.

579
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:32,438
I definitely feel
very vulnerable and nervous.

580
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:36,675
When you are rejected,
it makes you question yourself.

581
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,477
It makes insecurity come up.

582
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:39,845
- Mind if I grab you for a sec?

583
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,347
- Yeah, of course.

584
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,116
I would be lying
if I said I didn't think

585
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,584
other people would walk out.

586
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:49,154
I'm just having a really
hard time moving forward.

587
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:52,024
And if this doesn't go well,
I don't know if I can,

588
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,293
so hopefully tonight
changes all that.

589
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,061
Because at this point,
I feel like

590
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,963
everyone's gonna walk out.

591
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,964
- How are you? Like...

592
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,766
- It just was like...

593
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,669
Obviously me and Gabby's,
like, biggest fear,

594
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,571
like, in this whole thing
is, like,

595
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,939
is someone gonna flip?

596
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:07,940
- I'm sorry you had
to deal with that.

597
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,174
- It's okay.

598
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,909
- Like, the fact that, like,

599
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,887
you hold it together
with such composure and grace.

600
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,646
- Thank you.
- I mean, seriously.

601
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,415
You don't have to apologize,
it's like...

602
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:17,683
- I do.

603
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,551
- I do really appreciate that.

604
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:23,088
But I mean, like,
I'm here because

605
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:25,491
I love that feeling
of seeing you smile

606
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:26,558
and making you happy.

607
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,627
That's who I am.
I'm wanna make you smile

608
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:29,771
and I wanna make you happy
every day.

609
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:30,863
- I love that.

610
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,698
Thank you
for checking up on me, truly.

611
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:33,799
- Of course, of course.

612
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,540
- What a day.

613
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:42,875
- Yeah, it's a tough one.

614
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,143
- She handled that very well.

615
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,711
- Absolutely.
- That's tough.

616
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,088
- Oh, my gosh,
are you kidding me?

617
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,214
Especially with Logan
getting a rose last night.

618
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,583
- Ah...
- Yeah, you know,

619
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,328
you know, I want to have
a conversation with her.

620
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,821
You know, to just tell her
that I am here for her,

621
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:59,425
and I'm 100% invested
in this relationship.

622
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,660
- I agree. Yeah.

623
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,772
The other guys, they're
in a different place than me.

624
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,631
They all have expressed
that they want

625
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,399
to make sure she's happy
and feels like

626
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:10,235
a million bucks tonight.

627
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,937
And that's all amazing, it is,

628
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,105
and I want to do the same,

629
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:16,575
but I want to touch
on how I feel.

630
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:17,743
- This is for us.
- Wow.

631
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,978
- I wanted to do
something special for you.

632
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,413
- I actually was pretty hurt.

633
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,516
You know, I see Rachel
as my future person,

634
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,886
and it didn't sit
the best with me.

635
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:30,622
When you're in a relationship,
a healthy relationship,

636
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,058
you both need to be able
to communicate your feelings.

637
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,893
I'm, like,
a little bit scared to have

638
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,730
this conversation
with Rachel, but like,

639
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,165
we definitely gotta have it.

640
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:44,169
Moving forward,
I want to be your person...

641
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:45,246
I mean, that's why I'm here...

642
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,705
And I want to be
your best friend,

643
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:50,709
and I want you to be able to
tell me literally everything.

644
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:54,746
And I'll just say, like, I'll
take any piece of you any day,

645
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,383
and today we lost,
like, something that, like,

646
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,885
I think we could have made,
like...

647
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:03,522
I mean, I know could have made,
like, an amazing memory.

648
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:08,160
But today, you know,
hurt a little bit.

649
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,361
- Yeah.

650
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,663
- Like, it made me feel
a little unseen.

651
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,174
Like, I don't want to make you
feel bad at all, like...

652
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,433
- No, I want you...

653
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,144
I want you to keep telling me
how you feel.

654
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:19,271
- I feel like our
relationship at this point

655
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,573
has gotten to the point
where, like, we can

656
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,342
talk about stuff like this.
- Yeah.

657
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,343
You have no idea.

658
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,678
I do see you.
- Okay.

659
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:30,415
- I literally look forward
to every single time

660
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,751
we get to spend together.

661
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,262
- I want to keep building
on what we have,

662
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:35,864
not, you know,
kind of gloss over things.

663
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,098
And I want to build it
the right way.

664
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,557
- I love that.
Believe me.

665
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,625
Thank you.

666
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:51,303
Tino continues to be truly
open and vulnerable with me.

667
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,706
And hearing him want
to be around me

668
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:58,243
even if I'm not in a good mood
or if it's just for a second,

669
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,245
it's a really good feeling,
especially

670
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:02,447
after all the rejection
I've been through.

671
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:07,853
It really just does
make me hopeful.

672
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,222
- You know, how are you?
- I'm good.

673
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,666
This was, like,
the last thing I needed.

674
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,791
- I know.

675
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,593
I feel like you've
been through a lot.

676
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:19,231
- And so far tonight,
everyone is checking up on me

677
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:20,532
and validating me.

678
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,201
- You know, we missed you today.

679
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,569
We were waiting for you
to, like,

680
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,571
eat waffles and drink beer.

681
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,573
- I want a Belgian beer so bad.

682
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,809
And although it was
definitely nerve-racking

683
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:34,012
walking in tonight,
everyone's truly been able

684
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,317
to make me feel so special.

685
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,186
- How cool is that?
- Oh, my God.

686
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,921
- Just for you.

687
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,756
- Oh, my God.

688
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,125
I feel like I'm in the stars.

689
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,860
- You are the star.

690
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,473
- It's been so tough
to get to this point today,

691
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,010
but my feelings are just
growing stronger and stronger,

692
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,412
and it's a really great feeling.

693
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,482
- How are you doing today?

694
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,818
Do you feel like
you can, like, breathe now?

695
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,086
- Yeah, no, I feel better.

696
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:17,456
I wanted to, like, really
show up for everyone.

697
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:18,857
- I was pretty worried
about you.

698
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,826
If you were okay,
and feeling still

699
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,562
like, okay about everything
and all of us guys.

700
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:30,002
The connections are, you know,
getting deeper, and it's, uh...

701
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,479
It's not easy,
and you're handling it

702
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,172
absolutely like a champion.
- Thank you.

703
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:38,243
No, I appreciate you
being so honest with me,

704
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,346
and truly, I feel like
every time I'm with you,

705
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:43,548
my day is so much better.

706
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,318
- You know, sometimes
if you want to let out stress,

707
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:49,688
like, you normally would yell,
right?

708
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,232
Do you need to get any... do you
want to get some yelling out?

709
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,256
- Yeah!

710
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,334
- Should we get
some yelling out?

711
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,493
- I want to.

712
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,237
- And keep in mind,
like, I got a deep yell.

713
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,396
- Can I just scream?

714
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,097
- All right, let's just scream.
- Okay.

715
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,300
- In three, two, one.

716
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:09,308
- It's incredible yelling out

717
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,743
all my frustrations with Zach.

718
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,645
He really does make me laugh.

719
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:17,616
I feel like I genuinely
can be myself around him.

720
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:20,919
I'm really happy that the day
was able to get turned around

721
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,488
because at this point
in the journey,

722
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:27,459
I want every single rose to go
to someone who truly continues

723
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:28,827
to step it up with me.

724
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:30,929
Hi, guys.

725
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,699
And after such a great night,

726
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:38,403
I'm very confident that these
guys are all here for me.

727
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:42,007
Um...

728
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:45,811
so I know that today
wasn't ideal.

729
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,914
And I really do appreciate
all of you being able

730
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,483
to truly show up tonight,
especially

731
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,952
after sort of a low day for me.

732
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:58,357
But this rose can only go
to one person.

733
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:05,297
And this person continues to
be extremely vulnerable with me

734
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:11,636
and is able to open up with me,
even when it's really hard.

735
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:15,307
And so...

736
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:23,482
Tino, will you accept this rose?

737
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,351
- Yes, I'd love to.

738
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,556
- I mean, it's funny 'cause,
like, every rose I get,

739
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,493
I feel like is like the most
important rose I've gotten.

740
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,195
But this one was a special one

741
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,464
because it is like resemblant

742
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,433
of, like, hard days
in a relationship.

743
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,705
It's exciting to, like, see
a future with somebody again.

744
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:48,874
- Have a good night, guys.

745
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:59,885
- I mean, I'm happy for Tino,
but like, damn, you know?

746
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,631
Rachel's the person,
you know, that I could

747
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,126
be spending the rest
of my life with,

748
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:06,391
and it's becoming
very, very real.

749
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:10,028
I mean I've been giving
my heart out from day one,

750
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:14,166
so there's, like, real,
real feelings on the line,

751
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:16,334
and I don't want to be hurt.

752
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:31,850
- I feel relieved.

753
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,853
I've said what I feel,
I've stated who I want,

754
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,421
and that's Gabby.

755
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:39,758
And what happens now
is out of my hands.

756
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,027
Gabby's going on
a group date today,

757
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:45,530
and I'm just hoping
that I'll get an answer soon.

758
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:49,668
And hopefully Gabby
will give me a shot.

759
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,416
Hey!

760
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,651
Hi!

761
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,553
- Ooh, that's a far road.
- Good to see you.

762
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,688
- You too.

763
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,556
You guys are always
out of breath.

764
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,692
Thank you. Hi!

765
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:18,697
Oh. It's so good... I know,
this is a great seeing... hi.

766
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:19,865
How are you guys?

767
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,633
- Good.
- It's so nice here.

768
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,935
- Today we just get to explore
the city,

769
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,706
one of literally the cutest
and charming European cities

770
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,274
that I've ever seen.

771
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:32,177
So I'm so excited to just
spend the day with you

772
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,145
and have some quality time.

773
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,212
Shall we?

774
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,348
- Yeah!
- Okay.

775
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:37,892
- I'm following you.
- I don't honestly

776
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:40,051
have a ton of doubts
going into today.

777
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,320
I feel like I have an open
heart and an open mind.

778
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:46,591
Best case scenario today
is that I connect more

779
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:50,462
with these men and just have
a sense of normalcy

780
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,497
and enjoying kind of
everyday things.

781
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:55,100
Have you guys seen these boats?

782
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,935
Should we go on one?

783
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:59,070
- Gabby gave her
one-on-one date to Johnny,

784
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,239
so I'm disappointed
a little bit,

785
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:03,008
but looking forward
to the date today

786
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,476
and getting time with Gabby.

787
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,611
This group date could
very well be make or break

788
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:09,247
in terms of my time
to continue to explore

789
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:12,417
something with Gabby and keep
building that connection.

790
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,252
- How fast can this thing go?

791
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,456
Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

792
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,700
This is beautiful.
- That's beautiful.

793
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,826
Like the greenery. I love it.

794
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,061
I love the old brick.

795
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:24,362
- Low bridge, Nate.

796
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,430
- Protect your head.

797
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:26,932
- Duck, duck, duck!

798
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,035
- Gabby looks amazing today.

799
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,837
She was in a all-black outfit.

800
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,707
I couldn't keep my eyes off
her, but going on a date

801
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:38,176
with five other guys, it's...

802
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,244
It's pretty weird.

803
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:46,651
- Oh, my God, I smell waffles.

804
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:48,954
- Waffles!

805
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,589
- Hi!

806
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:51,590
- How are you?

807
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:52,791
- Good, how are you?

808
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,259
- Welcome at House of Waffles.

809
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:56,728
- Thank you.
We're excited.

810
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,830
- Would you like to try
to make one yourselves?

811
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:00,665
- Love. Yeah.

812
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,476
- I've been wanting
waffles since I got here.

813
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,002
I'm just like, "Yes."

814
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,737
It looks so amazing.

815
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:06,905
- Wow.

816
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:09,975
- That is really good.

817
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,142
- Isn't it?

818
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,209
Ooh.

819
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,279
- You're going under?
- Yeah.

820
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,223
- This isn't natural to hang
out with, like, six guys

821
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,350
and one girl, but what
resonates with her is people

822
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,151
are willing to put themselves
out there

823
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,887
and to make her feel wanted.

824
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,289
So that's what I'm trying to do.

825
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:26,157
And she looks amazing,
so it's like...

826
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,258
It's a fun day so far.

827
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:28,893
Full of surprises.

828
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,972
So as long as we don't have to
physically fight each other,

829
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:32,440
I'm up for any surprise
at this point.

830
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,532
- Okay. Yo, we better D up.

831
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,870
- Swing it, swing it, swing it.

832
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:40,017
- God, these kids are good.

833
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,539
- Ooh.
- Clear it out. Clear it.

834
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,074
- Come on.
- Oh!

835
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,181
- First time I think I've
played soccer in 15 years.

836
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,478
Those kids are no joke.

837
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,255
They're good.
They're going between my legs.

838
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,914
But you gotta win somehow.

839
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,901
All right, I'm gonna start
picking these kids up.

840
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,833
- It's so fun to see the guys
interact with little kids.

841
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,358
Nate, you can tell
is immediately

842
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,494
comfortable around kids,
which is no surprise,

843
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,229
because he's a dad.

844
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,664
Just score one goal.

845
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,799
But really, everyone
is diving right in,

846
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:09,734
and it's kind of enlightening

847
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,169
to take a peek into the future.

848
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:13,004
You guys did so good.

849
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,974
The Belgian boys won the
soccer match fair and square,

850
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:18,977
but I know my guys are
pretty competitive, so I have

851
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:20,845
another surprise for them.

852
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:24,282
Oh!

853
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,519
- Out of nowhere, this big
burly Belgian guy

854
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:28,520
brings out
these two buckets of fish.

855
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,621
- Come.

856
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:30,922
- And he's like,

857
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,158
"You, we're gonna play
a Belgian game."

858
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,359
- You know this?

859
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:37,395
Rock, paper, scissors.

860
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:40,699
- Okay.
- Okay. One...

861
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:41,900
I win.

862
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,735
- Wait.
- Oh, God.

863
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,707
- That's the Belgian game.

864
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,943
- I am not accustomed
to a lot of Belgium games,

865
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,713
but I'd like to find the person
that made this game

866
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,681
and give him a piece of my mind.

867
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:59,317
Rock paper, scissors, shoot.

868
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,585
- Oh.

869
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:01,920
- Here it goes.

870
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,388
Here he goes.

871
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:04,956
- This is my friend
Flipper here.

872
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,024
Oh, say what up, Flipper.

873
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,959
"What up, dawg?"

874
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:10,862
You know, I feel
like Gabby likes me.

875
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,197
"Yeah, she was feeling you.

876
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,432
"She didn't want you
to see you slapped by us,

877
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,568
but you know what, YOLO."

878
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,270
For sho, for sho.

879
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,972
- In America,
this is how we play.

880
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,007
Instead of slapping the face...

881
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,244
Oh!

882
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:29,180
- That was a great day, but
the highlight was the kiss.

883
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,083
I saw an opportunity to go for
the kiss, and I went for it.

884
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,585
Why not?

885
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,362
I don't know how they felt
when I kissed Gabby,

886
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,956
but I don't really care.

887
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,382
- Thank you for choosing
this date.

888
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,464
We're having a great time.

889
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:41,559
- Oh, I'm so glad.

890
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,560
Yeah.

891
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,028
No, it means so much.

892
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,064
And really when I say,
like, I look at you guys,

893
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:48,967
and I truly do feel like
the luckiest girl in the world,

894
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:52,137
and I can't believe that
I'm here with all of you.

895
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,172
- We all felt like we had
a good amount of time

896
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,307
with her today, myself included.

897
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,109
So it's... it's just refreshing

898
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:00,245
to not have to worry about drama

899
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,813
and only worry
about the relationship.

900
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,816
So excited to continue it
into the evening portion.

901
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,858
- Today was a testament
to, like, our group.

902
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:16,127
We really do get along,
and we're all respectful.

903
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:17,929
- Ooh, there's one rose.

904
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:20,832
- Whittling down the group to
such a small number of guys

905
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:22,233
is the best move ever.

906
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,744
We're all gonna get
so much time tonight,

907
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,436
and I'm excited
to continue to grow

908
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:26,580
Gabby and I's relationship.

909
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:27,915
- I thought that
was a really special day,

910
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:30,141
just like getting out in
like a spring day in Bruges.

911
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,977
Sharing that with Gabby
and you guys was really cool.

912
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,288
I'm looking forward
to tonight as well,

913
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,689
so it's just like
I think everything's

914
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:36,724
kind of going in a positive way.

915
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:38,183
So I'm excited.

916
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,823
- Well, since it is
a smaller group of us,

917
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,867
I don't think that we're gonna
have to worry about trying

918
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,494
to steal time or worry about
when we're gonna grab her,

919
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:52,330
so it's gonna make it easier
to focus on the conversation

920
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:53,677
that we want to have with Gabby.

921
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,967
- Toast to a great first day
here in Belgium,

922
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,069
and toast to a great night
with Gabby.

923
00:38:58,136 --> 00:38:59,704
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

924
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,739
- I'm still a little salty
about the kids that

925
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,575
whupped us in soccer,
but you know.

926
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,721
- I think we need a rematch
with those kids tomorrow.

927
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,814
- Oh, oh.

928
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:14,018
- Oh!
- The hell?

929
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,486
- What side of the park you on?

930
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:16,721
- What is going on?

931
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:18,523
- How's everybody?

932
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,654
- I'm sure you guys
are curious why I'm here.

933
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,680
I would be too.

934
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:47,652
I originally had
a connection with Gabby,

935
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,855
but I decided
I was gonna pursue Rachel

936
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,324
because she saw something in me,

937
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,594
and she told me that we
could have something special.

938
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,733
As time went on, I didn't
quite see the same thing.

939
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:06,771
So I met with Rachel,
and I told her

940
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,606
"I can no longer see you,"

941
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:11,709
and I had a conversation
with Gabby.

942
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,979
And I got word today
that she wants me

943
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,248
to have an opportunity
to pursue her.

944
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:21,085
- I'm just confused right now.

945
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:24,289
Logan is hopping over to
Team Gabby, and it's just...

946
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,624
It's just...
I don't... I don't get it.

947
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:29,594
I guess we were thinking
that she saw, like,

948
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:31,996
her person in the guys here,
and for someone else

949
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:35,233
to be added, I just don't
know what to think right now.

950
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,403
- I will be moving in
with you guys as well.

951
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,638
So let's have a good night.

952
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,813
- Hi.

953
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,083
- It's upsetting
that Logan is here

954
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,885
because Logan would not be here

955
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,120
if Gabby didn't want
to explore that relationship,

956
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,656
so it makes me question
how strong really is

957
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,725
my relationship with Gabby
or Gabby's relationship

958
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,460
with any of the other guys here.

959
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:05,863
- I just wanted to say
thank you guys

960
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,332
for such a good day.

961
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:10,702
I feel like I had so much fun.

962
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,271
And Logan is here.

963
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:18,209
Um, I'm sure you all
have spoken.

964
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:19,210
- We did.
- Yeah?

965
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,378
- Yeah.

966
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:21,822
- Logan came to me yesterday,
you know,

967
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:25,850
to express his feelings, so...

968
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:27,885
yeah, here we are.

969
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:28,886
- Happy to be here.

970
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,321
- Thank you.

971
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:37,795
So let's make a toast
to an amazing day

972
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:44,002
and relationships flourishing
and still some to explore.

973
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,003
- Cheers.

974
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,971
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

975
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:48,940
- Cheers.

976
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:55,146
I'm worried about tonight
because knowing how far I am

977
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,115
along with these men,
I don't ever want

978
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,284
to jeopardize that
by having Logan come along

979
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,719
this late in the game.

980
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:05,156
But I really do want to be open
to all possibilities,

981
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:06,758
and I hope that
the guys understand

982
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:07,925
where I'm coming from.

983
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,394
- This is a big night.

984
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,904
You just kind of
brought on Logan, like...

985
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,330
- Yeah.

986
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:13,974
- You know, when you do
introduce something like that,

987
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,099
like, and you already have

988
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,343
these established relationships,

989
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,811
and you don't know, like...
Logan's been

990
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,037
back and forth a little bit.

991
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,783
And I want to let you know
that I'm all in.

992
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:21,873
- Thank you.

993
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,183
- And I think that
you're awesome,

994
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,276
and I'm very much about you,
and so

995
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:28,246
I'm not anyone that would
make you question anything.

996
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,348
And hopefully
my words carry weight.

997
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:31,416
- Yeah.

998
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,684
Like, I do really care for you.

999
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,720
I know your heart
is in such a good place.

1000
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:38,289
Like, I can tell you're ready
for a relationship.

1001
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:40,291
It's never been a doubt
in my mind.

1002
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:42,060
And I appreciate that about you.

1003
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,161
- Yeah.

1004
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:48,399
- I just didn't see that
coming, you know, from Logan.

1005
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:50,268
I thought he was, like,
crazy about Rachel.

1006
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,770
- Or maybe he's the most
calculated dude here.

1007
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,338
- Yeah.

1008
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,207
- I wonder if he gets
the group date rose.

1009
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:58,476
- I kind of feel like
that's gonna happen.

1010
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:00,011
- That would be so annoying.

1011
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,380
- The addition of Logan,
it is a wake-up call,

1012
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:04,124
and it has some of
the guys, including myself,

1013
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,784
on alert to kind
of reevaluate, like,

1014
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:08,019
where you stand.

1015
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,555
I always try to be,
like, as open as possible

1016
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:11,965
and just try to show you
all of me,

1017
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,029
and it was just fun today.

1018
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,201
Like, it just felt, like,
so natural.

1019
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:15,159
- Like, we just
got to be together.

1020
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:16,594
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1021
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:19,564
- The only bloop was obviously
the new Logan addition,

1022
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,399
but even then like...
- Yeah, how did you...

1023
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:22,800
Like, how did you take it?

1024
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:26,304
- So I, at first, I saw him
and I was like, "Okay,

1025
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,638
this is what's going on."

1026
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:30,475
But honestly, you should
explore every relationship.

1027
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,710
Like, I want to be chosen.
- Yeah.

1028
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:35,246
- So just know that you have
my support in all of this.

1029
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:36,247
- Yeah.
- You do.

1030
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:37,515
- No, thank you.

1031
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:39,450
I'm really, like, so grateful
for you guys,

1032
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:41,252
and just, like,
being here with you.

1033
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:43,988
I know group settings
are so hard.

1034
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:45,389
It kind of like...

1035
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:49,427
It's hard for me, too,
to have it be hard for you.

1036
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:50,661
- It's all right.

1037
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:01,839
With each week, I have gotten
closer to each of the guys,

1038
00:44:01,906 --> 00:44:04,142
and our connections
do grow stronger

1039
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,177
each and every time
that I see them.

1040
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:09,914
So with Logan coming in late,
I think emotions are high,

1041
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:13,784
but ultimately,
I hope that they just trust me.

1042
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,887
How are you?

1043
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:20,458
- I'm good. I mean...
I don't know.

1044
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:23,361
I obviously, like,
have feelings for you,

1045
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,930
and I think I'm, like, still,
like, flying

1046
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,774
off that, like, one-on-one time
where I thought we had,

1047
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,076
like, such this
amazing connection,

1048
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,434
and it just felt like us.

1049
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,538
And then this is like six guys
and you, and it just...

1050
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:34,906
I don't know.

1051
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:37,275
It, like, started to feel like
very real in that sense.

1052
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,442
- Yeah.

1053
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,912
- And I was, like,
used to being like,

1054
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,090
stealing you away, like, for
a kiss or something like that.

1055
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:45,049
And it just, like, felt,
I don't know,

1056
00:44:45,116 --> 00:44:47,251
it didn't feel,
like, that natural.

1057
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:50,755
- Sometimes it is kind of hard
having earlier one-on-ones

1058
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:53,491
because then, like, so much
progresses afterwards,

1059
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:56,861
but I do think about you a lot.

1060
00:44:56,928 --> 00:45:00,331
And sure, I think we could
probably grow some more,

1061
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:01,899
but I think there's time.

1062
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:06,003
- Yeah, I'll take the kiss that
I didn't get to steal today.

1063
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,773
- Yeah.
- Just this kiss.

1064
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,483
- As someone that feels like
that they're fighting

1065
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,886
for a group date rose,
to see Logan come in,

1066
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:23,597
you know, naturally you're
like, "Okay, you know,

1067
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:24,889
"do I have a shot tonight?

1068
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:26,333
Like, have you already
made up your mind?"

1069
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:28,993
- It does kind of muddy
the waters a bit.

1070
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,329
If Logan did get the rose,
it would speak volumes

1071
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,699
to where her intent lies.

1072
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:37,635
We'll see how things shake out,
but it's a little unsettling.

1073
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:39,503
- I kind of can't believe
that I'm

1074
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,681
getting to sit here with you.

1075
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:41,872
- Oh, I know.

1076
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,241
I bet you've been going through,

1077
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:47,245
like, so much
these last days or weeks.

1078
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:50,248
Do you feel, like, kind of good?

1079
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:51,816
- I feel great.
- Yeah.

1080
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:53,594
- I mean, this is what I
wanted, to be sitting here

1081
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:55,119
holding your hand, you know?
- Yeah.

1082
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:59,357
- And I realized, like, what
you had to go through in order

1083
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,926
to just, like, get me to sit
on this couch with you.

1084
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:04,895
It was, like, you had to have
difficult conversations,

1085
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:09,233
and like, you did that,
and let me be here,

1086
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,510
and this is where I want to be.

1087
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:11,469
Like, really.

1088
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,838
- Yeah.

1089
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,107
- Like, I'm very into you.

1090
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:17,575
So I'm glad to be here.

1091
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:18,576
- Yeah.

1092
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:19,777
Yeah, me too.

1093
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:23,614
I think the premise
of everything

1094
00:46:23,681 --> 00:46:25,883
is to listen to your heart
and try and find

1095
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,653
a way to do it with integrity,
which you did,

1096
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,855
so that means a lot.
- Thank you.

1097
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:33,457
Yeah.
- Yeah.

1098
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:43,100
- Sitting with Gabby, there
is no doubt in my mind

1099
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,535
that I made the right choice.

1100
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:48,205
It's time to pursue Gabby
in a way that is fierce

1101
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:51,976
and in a way that I can
make up for lost time.

1102
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:56,347
And if I got the group date
rose, I'd be pretty excited.

1103
00:46:56,414 --> 00:47:01,619
- I did want to thank you guys
honestly for such a great day.

1104
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:04,588
Unfortunately,
I just have one rose to give.

1105
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:08,793
I wish I could give you
all them today.

1106
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:10,227
So...

1107
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:15,599
Nate, will you accept this rose?

1108
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,968
- Yes.

1109
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,646
Ah, you need to go
through this sweater...

1110
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,305
Yeah.

1111
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:28,646
- Oh, I'm so happy that
I got the group date rose.

1112
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:31,982
It's my first one,
so it's amazing.

1113
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:35,186
We even added a guy tonight,
and I thought

1114
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:37,722
that it could have been him,
but she gave it to me,

1115
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,858
and I am so...

1116
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:42,593
I am so elated.

1117
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:45,930
- It sucks.

1118
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,399
Like, I went into tonight
feeling very good

1119
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:49,867
about, like, our talk,

1120
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:52,103
but Nate got
the group date rose,

1121
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:55,473
and we have Logan here now,
so I don't necessarily know,

1122
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,408
like, ranking-wise,
where I stand.

1123
00:47:57,475 --> 00:47:59,553
But I don't need to be here
for, like, eight more weeks

1124
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:00,978
just to see what happens.

1125
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,614
Like, that's just
a waste of my time, so...

1126
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,729
- I woke up this morning
feeling good.

1127
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:24,034
Last night, I made a fantastic
reconnection with Gabby.

1128
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:25,836
I think maybe there's still
a little tension

1129
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,463
with a couple of the guys
about the fact

1130
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:30,274
that I'm getting to switch over,

1131
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:32,676
and that's okay with me.

1132
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,212
I didn't think this would
be a popular decision.

1133
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:37,748
I'm just trying
to follow my heart.

1134
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:41,986
But I did hurt Rachel,
and I really hope

1135
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:45,723
she finds what she's
looking for on this journey.

1136
00:48:47,825 --> 00:48:49,894
- Wow, this is adorable.

1137
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,929
- I'm just so happy to be here
with you, truly.

1138
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:53,564
- I'm so happy to be here
with you too.

1139
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:55,709
Yeah, when my name was, like,
left off the group date card...

1140
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:58,436
- Mm-hmm.
- I was just lit up.

1141
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:00,738
I was like, "Yes, finally."

1142
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:02,907
- I feel like we've always
had, like, such a solid,

1143
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:05,075
like, base from the beginning.
- Mm-hmm.

1144
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,344
- And I feel like whenever
anything happens, like,

1145
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,880
you're the first person
I want to see.

1146
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,415
I feel really safe with you.

1147
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:12,883
- I love that.

1148
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:16,854
- I do have very strong
feelings for Aven.

1149
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:18,489
I have since the beginning.

1150
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:21,392
But I had a rough couple days
in Belgium,

1151
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,360
so today I just
really need to know

1152
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:24,962
that it's a two-sided connection

1153
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:26,397
and that we both feel that way

1154
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:29,066
and it's not just coming
from me.

1155
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:36,006
This is so cool.
- This is amazing.

1156
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,217
- I'm so happy
you're here with me.

1157
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:38,676
- I know.

1158
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,778
I missed you.
- I missed you.

1159
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:41,946
- I've been looking forward

1160
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,347
to this one-on-one with Rachel,

1161
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:45,816
and now that it's here,
I'm really excited.

1162
00:49:45,883 --> 00:49:47,203
You know,
the things that Rachel's

1163
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:49,131
been through up to this point
haven't been easy.

1164
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,322
So I can't wait
to explore the city

1165
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,657
and just try to make today
as special as possible.

1166
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,493
And you know, just reassure her

1167
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,562
that I'm 100% here for her only.

1168
00:49:58,629 --> 00:49:59,797
- When is your birthday?

1169
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:00,798
- November 6.

1170
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:02,099
- What's you zodiac sign?

1171
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,268
- Scorpio.
- I'm a Pisces.

1172
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,436
- Oh, let's go.

1173
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,705
- Ooh, it must be a match.
- Check.

1174
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:10,107
- Right off the bat,
Aven is one of the most

1175
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,076
handsome men I've ever seen.

1176
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,044
And we are exploring Bruges,

1177
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,447
which is one
of the most romantic places

1178
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:17,781
I've ever been to,

1179
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,818
and that's all I want today
is romance.

1180
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:22,486
I love chocolate.
What do you think?

1181
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:23,563
- I'm in.
- Do you want to go in?

1182
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:25,890
- Let's do it.
- Oh, my gosh.

1183
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:27,992
- Oh. Oh, my. All right.
- Oh, my gosh.

1184
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,159
It smells so good.

1185
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:30,961
- So we're getting hefty today.

1186
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,496
- Ready?

1187
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:33,497
- Mmm.

1188
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:35,666
- Aven is such a great person.

1189
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:37,201
He's so funny.

1190
00:50:37,268 --> 00:50:38,269
He makes me laugh.

1191
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,971
How do you do that?

1192
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,038
- I don't know.

1193
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,374
This is a hidden talent.

1194
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,709
- And we've always had
a good physical connection,

1195
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,311
but he's really stepping it up.

1196
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,613
You know, touching me
and kissing me

1197
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,583
and making me feel desired
and wanted.

1198
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:56,120
- Hi!

1199
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:57,430
- What you guys doing over here?

1200
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:58,389
Sewing?

1201
00:50:58,455 --> 00:50:59,990
- We... no, no, no, no, no.

1202
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,559
We are making lace.

1203
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,970
It's a very... a tradition since
the 15th century in Belgium.

1204
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:05,029
- Oh, wow.

1205
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:06,597
- That's incredible.

1206
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:11,902
- So if you choose him,
what will be the wedding like?

1207
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:13,437
- It would be
a very big wedding.

1208
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:16,106
- Big wedding.
What we do is wearing a veil.

1209
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:17,241
- Wow.

1210
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:20,210
- So now you have to close
your eyes.

1211
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:21,679
Just pop it over.

1212
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,213
Oh.

1213
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,916
Now you can see
if he's good kisser.

1214
00:51:25,983 --> 00:51:27,685
- Ah.

1215
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,453
- Leave it on.

1216
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:35,559
Oh.

1217
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:38,195
Beautiful.

1218
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,331
- I've never kissed someone
with a veil on my head,

1219
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:42,700
but it feels right.

1220
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,002
A wedding is something
that I definitely

1221
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:47,171
feel like could be
in our future.

1222
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,015
- That looks beautiful on you.
- What do you think?

1223
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,359
- Can we just take
this one to go?

1224
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:51,909
Can we get this gift wrapped?

1225
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:53,043
- Yeah.

1226
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,245
- Aven is so romantic.

1227
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:56,680
It just feels like
everything today

1228
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:57,881
has just been so perfect.

1229
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,516
I love spending
the day with him.

1230
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:00,618
Oh, I think we're here.

1231
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,319
- Oh, my God.
Look at this view.

1232
00:52:02,386 --> 00:52:05,923
- I already feel like we have
such a strong connection,

1233
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:09,693
so tonight I can't wait
to get to know him more.

1234
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:14,798
- So excited.

1235
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:15,933
- I know.

1236
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,143
- I did not expect
to come back here.

1237
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,902
- I know.
- But I'm happy we're here.

1238
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:23,741
- It's really scary to begin
to get these feelings...

1239
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:24,975
- After you.

1240
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:28,479
- Because I don't want
to get hurt.

1241
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:31,949
And as much as I don't
think Aven would hurt me,

1242
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:34,418
it is still in the back
of my mind,

1243
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:37,021
because I just feel like
no one can really blame me,

1244
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:39,156
that a shoe could drop.

1245
00:52:39,223 --> 00:52:41,125
So I hope I can
learn more about him

1246
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:44,795
and feel confident
giving him that rose tonight.

1247
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:47,464
I've been really looking
forward to this date with you

1248
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:51,902
for a while now, and I can't
wait to get to know you more,

1249
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:54,505
but I just wanted to thank
you for the best date.

1250
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:55,506
- Of course, absolutely.

1251
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:56,607
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1252
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,980
Well, I had just an
amazing day as you did.

1253
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:05,049
Definitely exceeded
well, well beyond.

1254
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,050
- I know.

1255
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:07,418
It was the best day with you.

1256
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:11,522
And I would love to hear
more about you and your life

1257
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:13,624
and what makes you
the way you are.

1258
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:14,892
- Yeah.

1259
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,603
Well, I think I told you
like when we first met.

1260
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:18,462
Stability is a big thing for me.

1261
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,230
Feeling secure
and that someone's

1262
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:22,700
like not just gonna dip out
at any point

1263
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:25,135
is, like, huge for me.

1264
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,205
Growing up, my parents
were like never together.

1265
00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:30,174
You know, I lived with
my mom for a few years

1266
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,276
and then I moved to with
my dad for, like, the rest

1267
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,677
of my life, basically.

1268
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:36,013
- And so how old was it?

1269
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,650
- I was ten, which was tough.

1270
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:40,951
I didn't want to do it.

1271
00:53:41,018 --> 00:53:42,295
I was like,
"I don't want to be here.

1272
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,922
Can you send me back?"
type of thing.

1273
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:47,558
And I didn't get to see Mom
that often.

1274
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:49,460
You know, our relationship
to some extent

1275
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:51,604
was like through a phone for
a while, you know what I mean?

1276
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:54,965
Which was tough like,
in high school, and it sucked.

1277
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:57,267
And honestly like, you know,

1278
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,203
you want to have like
a stable relationship

1279
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:01,338
with both your parents,
but I just really

1280
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,307
never saw her that much.

1281
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:06,243
So you know, me and my mom
got really close

1282
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,910
when I got older,
because of all the time

1283
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:09,456
that we didn't have
when I was younger.

1284
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,852
So in regards to all that, she
kind of made something for me,

1285
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,987
and it's kind of
like a good luck,

1286
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:18,589
good energy type of thing.

1287
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:22,092
So it's like this little
like, rubber bracelet thing.

1288
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:23,827
- She made this?
- Yeah.

1289
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:25,229
- Oh, my gosh.

1290
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,297
- And kind of seeing
how, you know,

1291
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:30,067
these last couple of weeks
have been tough for you,

1292
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:32,503
I think like, if you hold
on to it for a while,

1293
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,205
maybe it'll like turn
your experience in all this

1294
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,940
around for a little bit,
you know, so...

1295
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:41,211
- Well, you are turning this
around just starting with that.

1296
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,312
- Yeah.

1297
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:45,549
- But this is honestly
incredible.

1298
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:48,519
- It's been a tough week
for Rachel, so I want to just,

1299
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,355
like, be as open as possible
and there to be no grey area

1300
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:53,157
with how I'm feeling
in this moment,

1301
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:55,659
and I want to just kind
of do my best to remind her

1302
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:58,929
that I'm here for her.

1303
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:04,168
- I truly have had the most
incredible day with you,

1304
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:07,104
and I only wish
we had more time,

1305
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:10,240
because I just think we have
such an incredible connection.

1306
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,209
- Couldn't agree more.

1307
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:15,345
- So, Aven, will you accept
this rose?

1308
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:18,015
- Absolutely, of course I will.

1309
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:22,219
And I just wanted to say
I'm so honored

1310
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:23,921
that we're on this path
together,

1311
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,689
and I truly look forward
to the moments

1312
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:27,267
that we get to spend together
moving forward.

1313
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:28,725
- Asking me
for more one-on-ones?

1314
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:35,265
I'm very, very, happy
about how today went.

1315
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,569
I mean, it was an amazing night
from start to finish,

1316
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:42,172
and I've never felt this,
like, strong of a connection,

1317
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:44,274
or this natural of a connection,

1318
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,442
you know, so quickly.

1319
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,817
Oh, my God.

1320
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,723
Every moment I spend
with Rachel, our feelings

1321
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,701
are getting stronger
and stronger for each other,

1322
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:04,628
and I really do see Rachel
as someone

1323
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:07,531
who could be my future wife
and somebody that I do want

1324
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:08,999
to spend
the rest of my life with.

1325
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:15,505
- I feel so happy.

1326
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:19,943
Tonight is the perfect night
with Aven.

1327
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,678
He's been there to support me,

1328
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,081
and he has chosen me
immediately,

1329
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:25,382
and he's never wavered.

1330
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,553
I could easily see myself
falling in love with Aven.

1331
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,655
And I feel like
I'm almost there.

1332
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,542
- What's up, Johnny?
- Johnny.

1333
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:53,987
- You missed one hell of a day.
- Was it cool?

1334
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:55,321
What'd you guys do?
- It was crazy.

1335
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,314
- So we're all hanging out
around the couch area,

1336
00:56:57,381 --> 00:56:58,615
and someone walks up.

1337
00:56:58,682 --> 00:56:59,983
- Yeah.
- Logan.

1338
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,351
No.

1339
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:02,786
- Although he's
been with Rachel,

1340
00:57:02,853 --> 00:57:03,921
he has feelings for Gabby.

1341
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,422
- Is he coming over?
- He's over.

1342
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:06,890
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1343
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,929
- How do you feel?

1344
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,131
- I was bummed.
- Yeah.

1345
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:17,434
- The fact that Logan is here,
you know, we start to question,

1346
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:18,702
like, is Gabby questioning

1347
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:19,913
her connections
with the rest of us?

1348
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:21,414
- That's like...
That's what's kind of

1349
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,082
going through my head, too,
as I go on this one-on-one.

1350
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,775
It's like,
what connection do they have

1351
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:26,001
that I gotta kind of step up?

1352
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:26,977
- That's fair.
- Oh.

1353
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:28,312
- Oh.
- Whoa.

1354
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:31,481
- What's up, guys?
- Logan.

1355
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:33,350
- Going into my date with Gabby

1356
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:34,685
with Logan coming over,

1357
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,253
it's gonna be a little weird,

1358
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,588
but I'm gonna try to, you
know, compartmentalize that.

1359
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,615
All right, gentlemen,
I got a date I gotta get to.

1360
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,535
I'm out of here.
- All right, take care, Johnny.

1361
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,636
- Peace, guys.
- Bye, Johnny.

1362
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,729
- Me and Gabby,
right now we vibe.

1363
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,431
We know there's a connection.

1364
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,537
You know, we've admitted
that we're into each other.

1365
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,035
But this is not
looking for a fling,

1366
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:54,571
this is looking for
someone that is forever.

1367
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:57,975
So I'm over the moon
to finally get

1368
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,242
some one-on-one time with her.

1369
00:58:06,383 --> 00:58:07,383
Gabby!

1370
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:11,655
- What?
- So...

1371
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:13,924
- Come on.
- No. Yeah.

1372
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:17,928
I got you. I got you.

1373
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:21,198
Wait.

1374
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:23,066
I'm excited to spend the day
with Johnny.

1375
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:24,735
Johnny and I have fun.

1376
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:27,904
I have a fun day planned
in the countryside of Belgium.

1377
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,406
- Beautiful. Love it.

1378
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:31,842
- He's like so macho,
and too cool for school,

1379
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:34,845
which normally I'd hate,
but he pulls it off

1380
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,847
'cause he's like kind of goofy.

1381
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:39,383
But good relationships
are all about balance.

1382
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,184
The fun side, and the emotional,

1383
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:42,786
and the serious side.

1384
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,522
With Johnny, I don't quite
know if we have a balance yet.

1385
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:48,492
But today I'm excited
to see where things go.

1386
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:49,593
- Welcome.

1387
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:50,660
- Thank you.

1388
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,095
- Gabby.

1389
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:53,230
- This is beautiful.

1390
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:54,698
We're so excited to be here.

1391
00:58:54,765 --> 00:58:56,005
- We started already, actually.

1392
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:57,134
- Oh, you did?

1393
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,368
Without us?

1394
00:58:58,435 --> 00:58:59,836
- So my name is Ann.

1395
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:03,640
I'm actually sixth generation
in a family brewery,

1396
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,475
which is called The Half Moon.

1397
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,676
This is Vincent.

1398
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:08,612
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1399
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:10,380
- The brewer of the beers.

1400
00:59:10,447 --> 00:59:12,282
Speaking of beer,
let's go taste it.

1401
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:13,383
- Let's go.

1402
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:14,918
Yeah.

1403
00:59:14,985 --> 00:59:16,286
He has a one track mind.

1404
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:18,221
- Oh, hell yeah.
This is right up my alley.

1405
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:20,924
Whoa.
- Yum.

1406
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:22,059
- Gabby's, hands down,

1407
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,060
the coolest girlfriend
I've ever had.

1408
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,361
She brought me to Belgium,

1409
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:25,996
and she took me to a beer farm.

1410
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,165
It just made me that much
more attracted to her.

1411
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,600
- So smell it.

1412
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,869
- You can swirl it a little.
Get out the flavors.

1413
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:34,004
- Cheers.

1414
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:35,472
- Oh.

1415
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:38,475
You're enjoying this, huh?

1416
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:40,444
- We have an activity
for you to do together.

1417
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:41,445
- Oh, cool.

1418
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:42,446
- That's great.

1419
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:43,512
- Yay.

1420
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:44,614
Oh, my God.

1421
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,483
I actually don't know
what this is.

1422
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:47,651
- Is this a spa day?

1423
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:48,919
- I think so.

1424
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:50,287
- Is this a spa day?

1425
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:53,457
A Bruges...

1426
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:54,691
- So you drink this?

1427
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,127
- Immerse your entire body
into the beer.

1428
00:59:57,194 --> 00:59:58,395
Oh, I bet you can...

1429
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:00,873
- You could definitely
drink that.

1430
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:03,567
- I love spa days,
that's where I thrive.

1431
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,035
Did you bring your Speedo?

1432
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:06,862
- Yeah, actually,
that's what I'm putting on.

1433
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:12,109
- So we're gonna soak in beer,
maybe drink the beer,

1434
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:16,012
have a little fun in between,
and hopefully get weird.

1435
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,114
- Nice and hard.

1436
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,115
- Yes.
- Love it.

1437
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,182
Harder, harder.

1438
01:00:20,517 --> 01:00:22,853
- Do you like it?

1439
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:25,431
- Doesn't feel great.
- Does that kind of hurt?

1440
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,157
- No. Your turn.
- Try me.

1441
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:29,059
- No free rides.
- No!

1442
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,803
- I would never act like this
on a first date.

1443
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:32,796
- You hit me in my face.
- Try it one more time.

1444
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:34,331
No free rides.

1445
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:37,067
Usually, I'm more laid back
and not so assertive.

1446
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:40,904
- But Gabby is definitely
pulling it out of me.

1447
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:43,039
Wow, that feels amazing.

1448
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:45,275
- Does it?
- That's sandpaper.

1449
01:00:45,342 --> 01:00:46,910
Oh, no.

1450
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:48,545
Watching Johnny
be so comfortable

1451
01:00:48,612 --> 01:00:51,815
and kind of leaning into
the craziness is so special.

1452
01:00:52,883 --> 01:00:54,384
- That's beer.

1453
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:55,919
- Is it beer?
- That's beer.

1454
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:58,388
- This is the kind of person
I would want

1455
01:00:58,455 --> 01:01:00,690
to do these things with,
and this is the kind of person

1456
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,058
I can see myself with.

1457
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,059
- You drink it?

1458
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:04,126
I didn't drink it.

1459
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,195
I spit it out.

1460
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:07,197
Don't do that.
That's bad for you.

1461
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:14,271
- But Johnny and I
haven't had really

1462
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,706
intense conversations
yet and have kind of

1463
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:19,276
remained surface level.

1464
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,377
Oh, my God.

1465
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:23,713
- Oh, my God.
- This is beautiful.

1466
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:29,052
And I need someone who can be
there for me and be vulnerable,

1467
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:30,720
and vice versa.

1468
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:35,091
So I am excited to see if
Johnny can go there tonight.

1469
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:37,093
- Like, today, honestly,
was so strange for me

1470
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,297
because I never act like that.

1471
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:44,668
But I do, like when I'm
by myself in my room.

1472
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,103
No, I feel like, yeah,
it's just like super hard

1473
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,881
to get out of my comfort zone
like that, but...

1474
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:50,173
- Yeah.

1475
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,577
- Clearly, today I was like,
"Let's get in that tub."

1476
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:54,578
- Yeah.

1477
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:56,713
- Right?
- No, I loved it.

1478
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:00,016
You're, like, funnier
than I thought.

1479
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,185
- I was, like, super nervous
going into it,

1480
01:02:02,252 --> 01:02:03,186
I'm not gonna lie.

1481
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:04,888
- Oh, you didn't seem like it.

1482
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:06,995
Do you feel like you're
just, like, kind of guarded,

1483
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:13,630
or it takes you a while
just as a person to be weird?

1484
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:15,298
- I'm a freak.
- Yeah, I know.

1485
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:17,801
- No, I think it's both.

1486
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:20,103
I think, like,
I'm super guarded at first,

1487
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,105
and then it just
takes a while too.

1488
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:24,016
I think it's just because
like past relationships,

1489
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,910
and I feel like once I got
to that point of, like,

1490
01:02:26,977 --> 01:02:29,746
being, like, myself,
it just like ended.

1491
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:32,415
- You had said you were in one
kind of recently, no?

1492
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:35,151
- Yeah, but then I, like,
started to be myself

1493
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:37,220
and she like just
disappeared on me.

1494
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:38,431
I think that was
like really hard.

1495
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:39,489
- Yeah.

1496
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:40,633
- And that was
like the last time

1497
01:02:40,657 --> 01:02:41,867
I really, like,
let my guard down.

1498
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,126
- Yeah.

1499
01:02:43,193 --> 01:02:45,004
It's so hard with
relationships because I think

1500
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:47,964
it's impossible
to not take it personally.

1501
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:50,467
- Yeah, and I think when you...
I exude confidence...

1502
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,736
- Yeah.
- I'm, like, no, that's not me.

1503
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:55,972
I don't... I'm, like, the least
confident person ever,

1504
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:57,907
which is crazy, but...
- Yeah.

1505
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:59,976
I think you have a lot
to be confident about.

1506
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:02,812
I even see it really, like,
with you and the guys.

1507
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:06,182
I feel like people like being
around you for who you are.

1508
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:09,119
- I don't see it, but like,
I'm like so hard on myself,

1509
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:10,787
I feel like.
- Yeah.

1510
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:13,290
- I think I seriously lack,
like, some serious confidence

1511
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:16,593
to where like I should
probably, like, you know, talk

1512
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,561
to people about it,
or whatever but...

1513
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:22,032
I definitely struggle with it.

1514
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:25,235
Like, just depression
and like, really

1515
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:26,670
feeling bad about yourself.

1516
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:29,105
And I feel like I have felt
like at an all-time low

1517
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:31,241
all the time
for like no reason too.

1518
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:34,344
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1519
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:36,246
No, I can definitely...

1520
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:37,681
I feel like I relate.

1521
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:42,052
I've struggled a lot
with anxiety and depression

1522
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:45,555
in my life, and I've had
to relearn so many things

1523
01:03:45,622 --> 01:03:47,957
that I didn't get to learn
as a kid.

1524
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:49,902
And as an adult it hits you,
and you just think,

1525
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,428
I'm kind of...
- Exactly.

1526
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:55,932
- Yeah, like I'm broken
and nobody else understands.

1527
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:59,069
But I think we just have to be,
like, easier on ourself

1528
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:00,503
a little bit.

1529
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:04,074
Tonight, Johnny is saying
things to me that I don't know

1530
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,076
if he's really said
to anyone recently,

1531
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:08,712
but I think that's
such an important part

1532
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:11,748
of a relationship is the
willingness to be vulnerable,

1533
01:04:11,815 --> 01:04:16,586
and he's shown that
in so many ways today.

1534
01:04:16,653 --> 01:04:18,455
- I had a lot of fun today.
- Me too.

1535
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:19,622
- Like, a lot of fun.

1536
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:20,790
- Me too.

1537
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,168
- I did not want that to end.
- Yeah.

1538
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,493
- Can we do it again, please?

1539
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,961
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1540
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,996
- Um...

1541
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:34,037
But just like you said,
that I bring out a side in you,

1542
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:36,005
I feel like you do the same
with me.

1543
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:41,211
Like, I never have to be
reserved around you, you know.

1544
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:43,980
So, Johnny...
- Yes?

1545
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:45,281
- Will you accept this rose?

1546
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:46,348
- Of course.

1547
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:55,058
- I'm so happy right now.

1548
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:59,763
This rose means pretty much
everything in the world.

1549
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:02,599
From the beginning, this
whole thing has been natural

1550
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:04,501
with her,
and I think if something's

1551
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,403
meant to be, it comes natural.

1552
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,705
I can run faster
than you than you think!

1553
01:05:08,772 --> 01:05:09,906
Ah!

1554
01:05:09,973 --> 01:05:12,175
I really do believe
that what Johnny

1555
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,411
and I have is really special.

1556
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:18,181
I love the inside of Johnny.

1557
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:22,419
All the things I think that
he's maybe scared to put forth

1558
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:24,587
are the things
that I love the most.

1559
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:30,693
Oh, my God.

1560
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,862
Johnny,
he doesn't know how romantic

1561
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,632
or how sweet
or how special he is,

1562
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:39,135
but I am really grateful for him

1563
01:05:39,202 --> 01:05:42,005
and just so excited
to see where things go.

1564
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:44,274
I know it's just
the beginning for us.

1565
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,822
- Going into tonight,
this is an interesting

1566
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:01,291
Rose Ceremony,
because we have Logan here now.

1567
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:03,560
That kind of adds like
a weird dynamic to this group

1568
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,795
that like we have somebody new.

1569
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:08,097
I know some people aren't
feeling 100% comfortable.

1570
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:09,098
I mean,
I don't feel comfortable.

1571
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:10,366
I can't imagine how they feel.

1572
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:11,944
It's just starting to get
more real, so I think

1573
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,471
tonight, I'm curious to see
who goes home.

1574
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:18,741
- Anticipation is a little bit...

1575
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:19,885
I'm like, who's walking in here?

1576
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:20,910
Is Logan walking in here?

1577
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:21,911
- I know.

1578
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,547
I want them to come down so bad.

1579
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:26,483
- Tonight is gonna be
a bit of a curve ball,

1580
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:28,318
I think, with the Gabby side,

1581
01:06:28,384 --> 01:06:30,753
with Logan moving over
to their side.

1582
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,822
I'm sure that stirred the pot
quite a bit.

1583
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:46,236
- Gentlemen.

1584
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:47,937
- Going into the cocktail party,

1585
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:52,175
I just feel discouraged that we
got Logan from Rachel's side.

1586
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:54,043
What has he done to this point
to be worthy

1587
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,745
of coming into the journey?

1588
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:59,082
I don't know, so I'm nervous
going into tonight.

1589
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:02,495
- How's the week been
for you guys?

1590
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:03,853
I mean...

1591
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,421
- So the group date
was canceled.

1592
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,132
You know, Rachel
wasn't feeling ready for it.

1593
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:10,026
There was a lot going on
that day.

1594
01:07:10,093 --> 01:07:15,231
- To hear that, you know, those
events had also carried over

1595
01:07:15,298 --> 01:07:18,201
and affected Rachel
to the point of changing

1596
01:07:18,268 --> 01:07:21,571
the group date
is really concerning,

1597
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:22,939
and I'm sorry about that.

1598
01:07:23,006 --> 01:07:25,408
I think you guys understand
my intentions.

1599
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:27,911
- Uh, you know, there's
always concern, you know,

1600
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:30,480
when you think about
number of roses.

1601
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:31,857
Now there's
a little more concern,

1602
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:35,084
because there's same number
of roses, more guys.

1603
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:36,753
I haven't had
that real time with her yet

1604
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:38,288
and may not get that time,

1605
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:41,257
so hopefully the connection
is strong enough.

1606
01:07:41,324 --> 01:07:44,961
- It's been a long journey
to sit next to Gabby,

1607
01:07:45,028 --> 01:07:47,030
and it hasn't been an easy one.

1608
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:49,832
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, ..

1609
01:07:50,967 --> 01:07:54,470
- But when I'm with her,
I'm breathing fast,

1610
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:55,872
I'm feeling butterflies.

1611
01:07:55,939 --> 01:07:57,607
I want to keep this.

1612
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:03,146
But you know what, I never
asked Gabby for a guarantee,

1613
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:05,915
I just asked her for a chance,
and she gave me that chance.

1614
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:08,518
And tonight I really want
to capitalize on that chance,

1615
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:11,988
and I'm hoping
that I'm rewarded with a rose.

1616
01:08:12,055 --> 01:08:14,557
- Hi, guys.
Thanks for being here.

1617
01:08:14,624 --> 01:08:16,593
First and foremost,
I want to apologize

1618
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:18,861
to everyone who lost time
this week,

1619
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,663
but I'm so excited to have

1620
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:22,031
another night with all of you,

1621
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:25,401
and I am so hopeful
for what's to come.

1622
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:26,468
- Yeah.

1623
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:28,071
Coming into tonight,

1624
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:30,373
I have these
overwhelming feelings

1625
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,675
of this all becoming so real.

1626
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:35,278
I see these relationships
flourishing

1627
01:08:35,345 --> 01:08:38,448
and also getting really hard,

1628
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:42,218
but with great risk
comes great reward.

1629
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:47,357
So cheers to a great night
and let's have some fun.

1630
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:49,125
- Cheers to that.

1631
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:52,695
- Logan is the big question mark

1632
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:57,133
that we're all wondering how
much Gabby really sees in him.

1633
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,535
His connection may be stronger
than we assume.

1634
01:09:01,671 --> 01:09:04,040
Just because I have a rose
doesn't mean that I feel

1635
01:09:04,107 --> 01:09:05,708
secure in our relationship.

1636
01:09:05,775 --> 01:09:08,811
I do feel good about it,
but you never know.

1637
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,852
I love your laugh.

1638
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:17,453
- Well, I do have
something for you.

1639
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,322
- You do?
- Yeah.

1640
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:20,957
It's a little gift.

1641
01:09:21,024 --> 01:09:24,794
I don't know if you've been
souvenir shopping in Belgium,

1642
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:26,896
but open it.

1643
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:28,398
There's...

1644
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:31,300
It's Belgian chocolate,
for your daughter.

1645
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,039
I know you really miss her.

1646
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:37,507
- Thank you so much.

1647
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:40,176
- Mm-hmm. Of course.

1648
01:09:40,243 --> 01:09:41,778
- Okay.

1649
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:54,090
- I'm nervous.

1650
01:09:54,157 --> 01:09:56,259
My fate tonight
is completely unknown.

1651
01:09:56,325 --> 01:10:00,496
Gabby either
has to give me a rose,

1652
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:03,266
who's been in the house
for two days,

1653
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:05,935
and turn away
one of these other guys,

1654
01:10:06,002 --> 01:10:08,871
who have been like solid
for her.

1655
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:10,907
- Does that count?

1656
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:12,909
That counts.
- All right, that counts.

1657
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,144
Which is not fair, because
you wore this dress here,

1658
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,746
and I was distracted.

1659
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:19,782
- A lot of these guys are
going in with weeks and weeks

1660
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:21,317
with Gabby.
- You look amazing.

1661
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:22,318
- Thank you.

1662
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:23,720
You do too.
- Thank you.

1663
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:25,497
This was my first impression
suit, so you know...

1664
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:26,656
- Ooh!

1665
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,233
- I thought I, you know,
let me go ahead.

1666
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:30,993
- Time to tell her who they are
and learn about who she is.

1667
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,296
- You like to pick on people,
in like a good way.

1668
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:34,362
- In a good way.

1669
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:35,932
But you've earned my sweet side,

1670
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,576
you've been so sweet to me.
- Oh. Thank you.

1671
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:42,638
- Knowing that makes my odds
seem pretty slim.

1672
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:46,175
- You impress me.
- No, you impress me.

1673
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,611
You have a very
like individualized way

1674
01:10:48,678 --> 01:10:51,514
of making me feel special.

1675
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:55,218
- It would be astronomical for
her to pick me over someone

1676
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:57,186
who has been unwavering.

1677
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:00,690
- I feel like we hit it off
from the beginning,

1678
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:03,359
and like, every time we talk,
I want you to know

1679
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,262
that, you know, it's just us.
- Yeah.

1680
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:07,897
- But I don't want to lose this.

1681
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:09,198
The only way I can get

1682
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,034
to a level with Gabby
that other people have

1683
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,170
had the chance to
is by being myself.

1684
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:17,406
I wasn't able to be part
of the last group date.

1685
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:18,517
- You want to get slapped
by a fish?

1686
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:19,809
- You guessed it.

1687
01:11:19,876 --> 01:11:21,186
- First we have to play
rock, paper, scissors.

1688
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:22,845
- Kay.
- And then you let me win.

1689
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:24,013
- Okay.

1690
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,615
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

1691
01:11:28,818 --> 01:11:30,486
No, we're on the same cadence.
Okay.

1692
01:11:30,553 --> 01:11:31,854
Thank God.
- Okay.

1693
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:33,189
Which side do you want?

1694
01:11:33,256 --> 01:11:34,323
Good side, bad side?

1695
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,159
- Obviously... what's
your good side?

1696
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:37,560
- Um...

1697
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,028
Oh!

1698
01:11:39,095 --> 01:11:40,429
- Wow, that's it?

1699
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:42,999
In the throat?

1700
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,734
Went to my neck.

1701
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:46,035
- Okay.

1702
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:50,072
- Okay.

1703
01:11:57,547 --> 01:11:59,382
- I can smell the fish.

1704
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:00,850
- Does it smell bad?

1705
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,335
- Now that Logan's here,
it's just sucks,

1706
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:12,762
especially for people who are,
you know, gonna get sent home.

1707
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:14,664
Like, I would totally feel
some type of way

1708
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,241
putting in all this work
and then Logan

1709
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:18,034
stepped in and just...

1710
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,002
- Gets traded to the Kings,
drops 40 game one.

1711
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:21,904
Like, yeah, that's tough.
- Can't win.

1712
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:23,515
- It was already game seven
for some of us,

1713
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:25,408
and now it's overtime, like...

1714
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:28,945
- I'm pretty nervous going
into tonight's Rose Ceremony.

1715
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:32,014
I think Gabby brought
Logan here for a reason.

1716
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:33,692
You know, does she see
something in Logan that

1717
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:34,893
she doesn't see
in the rest of us?

1718
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,853
So it's, you know...
Kind of makes all of us,

1719
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:39,322
but especially me, kind of
doubt where we are with Gabby.

1720
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:42,892
- Gentlemen, sorry to interrupt.

1721
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:45,261
The cocktail party is now over.

1722
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:47,248
So we do have to get ready
for the Rose Ceremony.

1723
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:52,869
- I think Logan coming over
is gonna push someone out

1724
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:55,438
who may have not
been getting pushed out.

1725
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,384
- I think my chance of
getting a rose tonight

1726
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:01,244
are actually low, but you know,

1727
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:02,788
Logan just came back
into the equation.

1728
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:04,680
He hasn't had
much time with her,

1729
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:06,115
so anything can happen.

1730
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:09,218
- You know, I've been
in the Gabby trenches

1731
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:10,553
since the initial onset.

1732
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,288
Hopefully she sees that.

1733
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:15,424
So I hope Logan doesn't get
a rose and is sent home.

1734
01:13:25,101 --> 01:13:28,271
- Going into tonight's
Rose Ceremony,

1735
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,539
I'm anxious, nervous, obviously.

1736
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:33,342
If I don't get a rose tonight
because of Logan,

1737
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,411
I just will be, you know,
extremely upset.

1738
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,317
- Logan getting a rose
makes me nervous

1739
01:13:41,384 --> 01:13:44,687
because that's one less rose
to go, to not just myself,

1740
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:46,923
but also the guys
that have been with me

1741
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:48,724
in the dating Gabby trenches.

1742
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:53,362
So I hope Logan doesn't get
a rose, but I have no clue.

1743
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,698
- I might be shocked
if Logan comes down.

1744
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:58,901
He's had the least
amount of time of anyone.

1745
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:01,938
- And if she does pick him,
then it's, like, you know,

1746
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:03,606
it's very telling.
- Yeah.

1747
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:04,783
- I know I'd be nervous as hell.

1748
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:05,807
- Yeah.

1749
01:14:12,315 --> 01:14:14,717
- I'm feeling a little uneasy
about tonight's Rose Ceremony,

1750
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,986
because Logan moving over
to the Gabby side

1751
01:14:17,053 --> 01:14:18,321
really hurt Rachel.

1752
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:21,157
It's on everyone's mind
where her head's at.

1753
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:27,196
- I feel like I'm definitely
on the chopping block tonight,

1754
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:30,599
and the only person
that I have to blame is Logan.

1755
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:33,302
Hopefully, I get a rose,
but I don't know.

1756
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:36,706
It could be any one of us
going home tonight.

1757
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:38,083
- I feel like
we're gonna be shocked

1758
01:14:38,107 --> 01:14:39,842
at the first person
who walks in.

1759
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:42,878
- The real question is, do we
think Logan gets one or no?

1760
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:44,213
- I think he does.

1761
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,481
- I think he does too.

1762
01:14:45,548 --> 01:14:46,948
And it's gonna cause some.

1763
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:47,983
- A stir.

1764
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:07,036
- I just wanted to say,
first of all,

1765
01:15:07,103 --> 01:15:11,574
I truly am lucky to know
each and every one of you.

1766
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,110
Of course,
going into every week,

1767
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:17,013
there are challenges.

1768
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:20,249
Just know that if you do not
receive a rose tonight,

1769
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:24,286
ultimately, I just
have to follow my instinct,

1770
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:28,190
and I truly appreciate
each and every one of you.

1771
01:15:29,392 --> 01:15:33,329
- Yeah, this week
has been incredible.

1772
01:15:33,396 --> 01:15:36,966
I think each week
keeps surpassing the last

1773
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,835
in so many ways,
so thank you so much

1774
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:41,337
from the bottom of my heart.

1775
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:56,786
- Curious to see who comes down.

1776
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:58,320
- I am too.

1777
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,755
I think the first guy
is gonna be,

1778
01:15:59,822 --> 01:16:01,090
um, Erich, for sure.

1779
01:16:01,157 --> 01:16:02,191
- Yeah.

1780
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:13,602
- Jason.

1781
01:16:19,275 --> 01:16:21,977
Jason, will you
accept this rose?

1782
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:24,413
- Of course. I'd love to.

1783
01:16:34,824 --> 01:16:36,425
- Damn, boy.

1784
01:16:36,492 --> 01:16:38,227
What's up, J?
- With the number one.

1785
01:16:38,294 --> 01:16:40,229
- How's it going, man?
- Number one.

1786
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:41,936
- You made it.
- You guys are one and two.

1787
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:44,066
- How many roses
were on the table?

1788
01:16:44,133 --> 01:16:45,901
- We had four.

1789
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:47,236
- Oh.

1790
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:48,871
- And Rachel had three.

1791
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:50,239
- Wait, Rachel had three?

1792
01:16:56,312 --> 01:16:58,547
- If it's not Ty first,
Ty is second.

1793
01:16:58,614 --> 01:16:59,748
- There's no way it's Zach.

1794
01:16:59,815 --> 01:17:01,484
It's gotta be Tyler.

1795
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:03,385
- I can see Zach
coming in last, actually.

1796
01:17:09,225 --> 01:17:11,227
- Zach.

1797
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:21,470
Zach, will you accept this rose?

1798
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:23,839
- 100%

1799
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:38,387
- On paper, the odds
are not in my favor tonight.

1800
01:17:38,454 --> 01:17:41,357
- Spencer.

1801
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:43,993
- I'm going up against guys
who have gotten to know Gabby

1802
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:47,630
for five weeks.

1803
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:50,466
Would have been much easier
to continue on

1804
01:17:50,533 --> 01:17:53,669
and commit to Rachel
without a problem,

1805
01:17:53,736 --> 01:17:55,504
but it wouldn't have been right.

1806
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:58,541
- Tyler.

1807
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:03,879
- Because I've had another week
to figure things out.

1808
01:18:03,946 --> 01:18:05,314
My feelings have been sorted.

1809
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:07,650
I know what I want,
and I've put it out there.

1810
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,418
Now a rose means

1811
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:12,188
that's either accepted
or turned away.

1812
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:15,424
- Erich.

1813
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:20,229
- And it's intense.

1814
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:22,631
- Erich, will you accept
this rose?

1815
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,366
- Yes, of course.

1816
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:27,403
- Because I am not sure at all

1817
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:29,538
that Gabby feels
the same way I do.

1818
01:18:36,679 --> 01:18:39,682
- Gabby, Rachel, gentlemen.

1819
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:41,183
It's the final rose tonight.

1820
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,551
When you're ready.

1821
01:18:53,629 --> 01:18:55,931
- There's only one rose left.

1822
01:18:55,998 --> 01:18:58,267
I'm scared, you know?

1823
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:02,571
There's a chance that this
is the last time I see Rachel.

1824
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,212
- Ethan.

1825
01:19:11,013 --> 01:19:12,848
- I love you, bro.

1826
01:19:16,018 --> 01:19:18,954
Ethan, will you accept
this rose?

1827
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:20,889
- Absolutely.

1828
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:39,341
- It's down to me,
Mario, and Mike,

1829
01:19:39,408 --> 01:19:41,977
so it's now or never.

1830
01:19:42,044 --> 01:19:44,313
- Until Logan walks down,
I'm still, like,

1831
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,448
not even, like,
considering that as an option.

1832
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:47,759
- I think
it's gonna be Michael, but...

1833
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:48,851
- I think it's Mario.

1834
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,195
- I think Mario
comes down those stairs.

1835
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:52,354
- I think it's Mario.
- I think it's Logan.

1836
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:00,763
- Logan.

1837
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:09,905
Logan, will you accept
this rose?

1838
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,407
- Yes.

1839
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,417
- She gave me a rose.

1840
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,252
She stamped it,
made it official.

1841
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:24,320
I feel great.

1842
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:27,623
I feel incredible.

1843
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:30,025
- Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

1844
01:20:30,092 --> 01:20:31,960
Please take a moment
and say your goodbyes.

1845
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:34,029
- I mean, three guys up there,

1846
01:20:34,096 --> 01:20:35,731
I've had the least
amount of time.

1847
01:20:35,798 --> 01:20:38,167
One of them's had
five weeks with Gabby.

1848
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:40,135
- Michael.
- Gabby.

1849
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:42,404
- Thank you for everything.
- Yeah. Likewise.

1850
01:20:42,471 --> 01:20:45,641
- One of them got
the First Impression Rose.

1851
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:47,185
- It's been a fun ride.
- Thank you for everything.

1852
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:48,344
- No problem.

1853
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:51,714
- And yet she chose me
to get the rose.

1854
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:54,516
- Ah.

1855
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:55,918
- Wow.

1856
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,353
- Logan's coming down.

1857
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:00,889
- Plot twist of the evening.
What's up?

1858
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:02,334
- Hello, gentlemen.
- What's up, man?

1859
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:03,692
Congrats.
- Thank you.

1860
01:21:03,759 --> 01:21:04,893
- Congrats.

1861
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,429
I wasn't sure that Logan
was gonna show,

1862
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:10,466
but now I know that,
you know, he's here.

1863
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,235
And he is vying for Gabby's
affection and love,

1864
01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:16,739
so welcome to the squad,
I guess.

1865
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:18,674
So Michael and Mario
are going, huh?

1866
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:20,342
- Yeah.
- Wow.

1867
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:21,977
- I would respect it
if it was Mario,

1868
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:23,846
because he's
been putting in work.

1869
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:26,348
But to each his own.

1870
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:29,017
In all honesty,
it was tough to see,

1871
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:31,186
but weak links are gone.

1872
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:33,021
- Thank you.

1873
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:35,257
Hi.
- Hey, Gabby.

1874
01:21:35,324 --> 01:21:37,192
And is getting real.

1875
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:39,027
- Hello.
- How're you doing?

1876
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:40,028
- Good.

1877
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:41,363
- Everyone's a hitter.

1878
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:44,933
- We are setting sail to a place

1879
01:21:44,967 --> 01:21:47,169
where it's very romantic.

1880
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:48,237
Shocker.

1881
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:50,139
- It's an even playing field
now,

1882
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:52,775
and it's anyone's game,
so might as well be my game.

1883
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:57,246
- Somewhere that's known
for its landscapes.

1884
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,715
- There's no point
in stopping now.

1885
01:21:59,782 --> 01:22:01,250
Full speed ahead.

1886
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:02,351
Me and Gabby.

1887
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:04,019
- We're going to Amsterdam.

1888
01:22:05,888 --> 01:22:09,124
- Still to come this season
on "The Bachelorette"...

1889
01:22:09,191 --> 01:22:11,059
- I can say now with confidence,

1890
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:12,895
I am falling in love with you.

1891
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:16,198
- I truly feel like
I'm on cloud nine right now.

1892
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:19,401
Everything I ask for,
you really embody it.

1893
01:22:19,468 --> 01:22:22,671
I really can't imagine
my life without you.

1894
01:22:22,738 --> 01:22:25,774
This is the best day ever.

1895
01:22:25,841 --> 01:22:28,510
- I've always wanted
to be with someone like you,

1896
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:30,746
but just never knew
if it was possible.

1897
01:22:30,813 --> 01:22:34,550
He has, like, really shown me
what it's like to feel loved.

1898
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:37,119
I feel like all my dreams
are, like, coming true.

1899
01:22:39,221 --> 01:22:41,723
Sometimes if things
are too good to be true,

1900
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,725
that is exactly what they are,

1901
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,994
too good to be true.

1902
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:49,832
- There has been
a situation with Logan.

1903
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:51,099
She was in tears.

1904
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:53,035
- I feel awful.
- You gotta pack your bags.

1905
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,137
- Watching her kiss
somebody else

1906
01:22:55,204 --> 01:22:56,572
is absolutely sickening.

1907
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,140
This is a joke.

1908
01:22:58,207 --> 01:23:00,509
- Tino is acting like
a real baby back bitch.

1909
01:23:00,576 --> 01:23:03,312
- I'm terrified of
not just being a mom,

1910
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:05,514
but being, like, bad at it.

1911
01:23:05,581 --> 01:23:07,449
I don't know what to do.

1912
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:09,885
- I'm just so conflicted now.

1913
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,220
I just don't understand.

1914
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:14,223
I feel so blindsided by you.

1915
01:23:16,425 --> 01:23:19,628
- I don't want to be with a boy.

1916
01:23:19,695 --> 01:23:21,730
I want to be with a man.

1917
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:25,667
- After overnights,
you change your mind?

1918
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:28,070
You told me things,
and then you went

1919
01:23:28,136 --> 01:23:30,005
back against what you said.

1920
01:23:30,072 --> 01:23:31,807
I'm so sick of this.

1921
01:23:31,874 --> 01:23:34,109
I don't want to do this anymore.

1922
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:37,446
He never loved me.

1923
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:44,086
How do you move forward?

1924
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:46,822
You can't.
Like, you can't do that.

1925
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,259
I would, like, literally
rather be alone.

1926
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:53,595
- He said he can't love me.

1927
01:23:56,298 --> 01:23:59,935
It's like, am I too broken
for anyone to love?

1928
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:11,747
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

1929
01:24:11,813 --> 01:24:13,649
- Oh.
- Oh.

1930
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,717
- You guys are sick.

1931
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:19,187
You like it...
- Oh!

1932
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:20,589
- This is the Belgium game.

1933
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:23,759
- Here we go. On shoot.

1934
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:25,460
Rock paper, scissors, shoot.

1935
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:26,595
Oh!
- Oh.

1936
01:24:26,662 --> 01:24:28,630
- Oh!
- I'm actually not...

1937
01:24:28,697 --> 01:24:29,697
Ah!

1938
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:31,066
You ain't around.

1939
01:24:31,133 --> 01:24:33,001
- You good, you good...
- Ahh!

1940
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,245
- Wait.
I want to play with you.

1941
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:35,547
- Got to do it in America
also, like this.

1942
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:37,272
- Yeah.
- With fish sticks.

1943
01:24:37,339 --> 01:24:38,707
- Oh.
- Okay.

1944
01:24:38,774 --> 01:24:39,708
- Me?

1945
01:24:39,775 --> 01:24:41,410
- Mm-hmm.
- Ooh.

1946
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:43,612
- All right, I'm out.
- Oh, la, la.

1947
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:45,814
- If you don't let me win,
I swear to God.

1948
01:24:45,881 --> 01:24:46,882
- Two and done.

1949
01:24:46,949 --> 01:24:49,751
- One, two, then shoot. Okay.

1950
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:51,553
- Okay. One. Two. Rock.

1951
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:53,455
- Oh.
- I won.

1952
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:55,057
- No.
- Yes, I won.

1953
01:24:55,123 --> 01:24:56,525
- No.
- I won.

1954
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:57,526
- No.

1955
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:58,794
You can kiss me.

1956
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:00,562
- You want to kiss with me?

1957
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:02,297
Whoa!

1958
01:25:02,364 --> 01:25:03,465
- I love it.

1959
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:05,167
- I'm like, "You guys go.

1960
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:06,335
Let's run away together."

1961
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:07,401
- Let's go.

1962
