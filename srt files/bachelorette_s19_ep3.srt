1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,736
- Tonight
on "The Bachelorette"...

2
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:06,640
- Ahh!

3
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:09,176
- Your smile melts my heart.
- Oh.

4
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:11,645
- It just feels
like a really beautiful start

5
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,547
to something really amazing.

6
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,115
- I do just want
to get on your lap,

7
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,218
'cause I feel like
I can get closer to you.

8
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,854
Right now I feel so loved
and seen.

9
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,298
- We're in a football field
right now.

10
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:23,924
- It was so special.

11
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:26,426
I feel like I'm gonna remember
this for the rest of my life.

12
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,362
- Even if you were
the only person here,

13
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,564
I don't think I could have
the heart to continue...

14
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:33,300
- "I don't want
a woman like you."

15
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,868
It hurts to hear.

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,046
- Like, because there's
two of us

17
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,872
they think they can act
that way.

18
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,807
- I don't know if I have
the capacity

19
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,644
to keep doing this, like,
week after week.

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,112
- Dude, the girls
just walked out.

21
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:48,015
- Damn, my brain is spinning
right now.

22
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,083
- How many people left?
Four left?

23
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,557
I'm leaving.
I'm literally quitting.

24
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,527
- It all starts right now.

25
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,172
- We survived the night.

26
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,074
- Yeah, man.

27
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,552
- Yeah, it was pretty tight
in that room

28
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,145
with that last rose.

29
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,980
- We have 21 guys now,

30
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:21,291
and I think we're
definitely at a point

31
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,750
where people are starting
to lean in directions.

32
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:24,827
People are like,
"I want to spend

33
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,253
more time with Rachel."

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,463
Couple guys want to spend
more time with Gabby.

35
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,855
And then there's
a decent amount...

36
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,433
They still want to explore
both relationships.

37
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,535
But my goal is just, like,
spend more time with Gabby.

38
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,637
Spend more time with Gabby.
Figure out how I can do that.

39
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,072
- Wait, who gave you
your rose again?

40
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,230
Was it Rachel or Gabby?

41
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,933
- Rachel,
but that don't mean nothing.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,368
- I feel like I already know,

43
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,136
something is there
with me and Gabby,

44
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,938
but I do have to explore

45
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,907
Rachel and I's connection first

46
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,509
before I can, you know,
choose a lane here.

47
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,578
- Did you guys talk
to both ladies last night

48
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,646
or was it just one?

49
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,047
- I got to talk to both of them.

50
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,059
I'm not leaning towards
one or the other right now.

51
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,719
So just kind of, like,
taking it day by day.

52
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,020
Okay.

53
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,130
- You know, I'm very interested

54
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,990
in both, you know,
Gabby and Rachel.

55
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,458
I haven't quite made
the decision

56
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,928
of which one I want to spend
all my time and energy with.

57
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,530
So, you know, right now,
I'm just happy to develop

58
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,077
those relationships
with both of them.

59
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:18,605
- Last night was really great.

60
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,174
And I think already there's men

61
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,110
that are clearly here for Rachel

62
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:26,346
and men who might be
more interested in me.

63
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,115
But there are a couple of men

64
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,050
more in the middle ground

65
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,519
that I think this week
will help us figure out

66
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,621
who we should pursue
relationships with

67
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,123
and who we're not meant
to be with.

68
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,961
Hi!

69
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,572
- Right now I'm afraid
of a couple things.

70
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,598
I'm afraid
that I'll kind of be let down.

71
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,568
And I'm afraid to make
the wrong decision.

72
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,004
- Obviously this
is a fresh new week.

73
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,148
- Yeah.
- And we're gonna be going

74
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,707
on dates this week.
- Mm-hmm.

75
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,075
- But at what point do you think

76
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:58,078
we need to, like, figure out
where everyone stands?

77
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,380
'Cause I feel
like that would give me

78
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,749
so much more clarity.
- Yeah.

79
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,560
- And it would feel
so much better moving forward

80
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,219
if I knew
where the guys were at.

81
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,721
- Yeah.

82
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,057
I want these guys
to be assertive

83
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,391
and make that decision fast.

84
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,127
I feel like they have spent
enough time with us.

85
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,064
So I think now the one's that
are lingering in the middle,

86
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,065
it's kind of sketch.

87
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,600
- No, I could not agree more.

88
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,235
- Yeah.
- It's disheartening, for sure.

89
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,503
- Mm-hmm.
I don't know.

90
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,405
Maybe this week
will help us figure it out.

91
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:30,744
I feel like we somehow need
to communicate that with them.

92
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,288
- I feel like
we could just tell them.

93
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,114
I mean, it's our journey.
- Yeah.

94
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,541
- Of course it's
up to them as well

95
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,883
who they want to explore,

96
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,061
but if at the end of the day...
- Mm-hmm.

97
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,220
- We make a decision...
- Yeah.

98
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,155
- It's kind of up to them
to reciprocate it

99
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,758
or decide not to continue,
I guess.

100
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,560
- Yeah, so true.

101
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,438
I feel like this is gonna be
a big week for us.

102
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,297
- I could not agree more.

103
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,674
And I think
they don't realize, really,

104
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,767
how much is on the line
this week.

105
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,736
- Yeah.

106
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,505
- Boys, how we doing?
What's going on?

107
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,774
Jesse!

108
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,509
What's up?

109
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,844
- All right, well, guys...

110
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,121
Well, if you can't tell by now,

111
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,781
Gabby and Rachel,
they're not messing around.

112
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,783
They're not looking for a fling.

113
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,952
They're looking
for their husbands.

114
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,054
Nate, what was it like for you

115
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:15,732
getting to spend
that entire day with Gabby?

116
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,390
- You know,
it felt like a lifetime.

117
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,268
I was fighting for
a lot of time during the week,

118
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,794
but to get that intimate time,

119
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,696
I got to cover
a lot of important topics

120
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:23,873
that I wanted to share with her.

121
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,766
And I did come home with a rose,

122
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,267
so I feel like our relationship

123
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,735
definitely progressed this week.

124
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,137
So I'm happy about that.

125
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,438
- That's fantastic.

126
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,306
You guys want to talk
about this week?

127
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,708
Yeah.

128
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,176
- It's a big one.

129
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:40,413
There will be two incredibly
romantic one-on-one dates.

130
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,082
There's gonna be one
with Rachel.

131
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,683
There's gonna be one with Gabby.

132
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,961
And there's gonna be
a rose on the line

133
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,853
at each of those dates.

134
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,021
- Whoo.
- Wow.

135
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,389
Let's go.

136
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:55,095
- There is also going to be
a massive group date.

137
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,730
Yeah.

138
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,065
- Prepare for anything
to happen this week.

139
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,334
Everything can change...
Like that.

140
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,072
For the first date,
got it right here.

141
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,140
This one's from Rachel.

142
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:10,510
Yeah!

143
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,879
- Have an amazing week.
Wish you all the best of luck.

144
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,015
And I hope to see you all
at the next Rose Ceremony.

145
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,092
Later, fellas.
- Thanks, Jesse.

146
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,818
- Thanks, Jesse.
- See you.

147
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,653
- I already know there's

148
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,188
an amazing connection
with Rachel.

149
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,791
I want to keep, like,
developing that relationship.

150
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,060
So I'm hoping for a one-on-one.

151
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,299
- All right, fellas.

152
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,485
- I am all-in on Rachel.
There's no question about it.

153
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,439
So I really want
this one-on-one,

154
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,874
like, more than anything.

155
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,710
- "Zach...

156
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,812
"Today is the beginning
of our love story.

157
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,947
Love, Rachel."

158
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,184
- Attaboy.
- My boy!

159
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,354
Whoo!

160
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:58,091
- I see you, man.
- How you feeling, man?

161
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,694
- I'm feeling great.
Like, pretty speechless, man.

162
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,829
Pretty speechless. Yeah.

163
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,866
- Yeah, she's one for one
for kicking people out, so...

164
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,068
Ooh. Ooh.

165
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,946
- You definitely want to hear
your name on that card

166
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,872
for the person that you're
kind of focused on.

167
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,974
So, yeah, I was hoping
it was gonna be me.

168
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,342
Unfortunately, it wasn't.

169
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,777
- I think it's about time
to get ready for that date.

170
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,078
- These one-on-one dates,
I think there's

171
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,548
definitely a new amount
of pressure.

172
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:22,859
I thought Jordan V.
Was coming back

173
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,251
after that first
one-on-one date.

174
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,518
He did not.

175
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,420
So you never know
what could happen.

176
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,322
So, you know,
you gotta be on you're A game.

177
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,523
- If Zach doesn't come back,

178
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,259
I think every single
one-on-one date card

179
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,125
we're gonna be praying
that it's not our name.

180
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,331
- Zach has a great connection
with Rachel.

181
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,135
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go.

182
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,404
- But at the same time, like,
she had a connection

183
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,481
with Jordan the first night.

184
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,140
And then bam, he's going home.

185
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,576
She might be using
these one-on-ones

186
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,344
as, like,
"I need to know right now

187
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,480
If I'm gonna like him
or he's going home."

188
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,795
- Today, I am really excited
for my date with Zach.

189
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:13,466
The first time we talked,
we had immediate chemistry.

190
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,137
But I don't really know
that much about him.

191
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,806
So today I really want to see

192
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,709
if Zach is here for me.

193
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,311
There is a rose
on the line tonight,

194
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,613
and I think
the stakes are pretty high.

195
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:31,284
- Oh, my God.
- Hello.

196
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:32,986
How are you doing?

197
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,090
We have
a really fun day planned.

198
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,701
Are you ready to head in?
- I'm excited.

199
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,093
- All right.
- Let's do it.

200
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,529
- But I actually don't know
what's happening.

201
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,397
I have enlisted the help

202
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,466
of someone very special today.

203
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,867
- Hey!
- Hello.

204
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,069
- Ooh.

205
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,937
- Hi, how are you doing?

206
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,340
Zach, this is Karamo.

207
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,574
- How are you doing?
- Hello.

208
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,052
Pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

209
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,478
- He is one
of my favorite TV stars.

210
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,113
You might know him
from "Queer Eye,"

211
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,449
but he's also an author,
a relationship expert...

212
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,783
- Oh, babe, you don't gotta go

213
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,361
through the résumé.
- And a culture expert.

214
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,187
- Listen, this night
is for you two.

215
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,755
I had to make sure
that I come here

216
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,856
to support her.

217
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,392
To make sure
that your relationship

218
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,227
jumpstarts on the right foot.

219
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,805
Listen, let's pop
some champagne, though.

220
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,173
You know what I mean? Come on.
- Please.

221
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,798
- I've been rooting for Rachel

222
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,234
from the first time I saw her
on the last season,

223
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,503
because she deserves love.

224
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,081
I mean, this is the first test
of a gentlemen.

225
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,573
Can you pop the champagne?

226
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,309
- Oh. Let's see.

227
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,511
- Okay.
- Okay, man.

228
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,247
No, I love Rachel so much.

229
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,815
So the fact that I get to set up

230
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,283
a date for her tonight

231
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,718
that I know is gonna be magical

232
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,888
and that's gonna surprise her
feels really good to me.

233
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:43,523
All right, so let me tell y'all

234
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,791
what I have planned.

235
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,528
So in my eyes,
you are a starlet.

236
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,796
Beautiful, gorgeous,

237
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,107
everything that we know
about old Hollywood.

238
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,766
That woman that we all admire.

239
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,068
So I actually have figured out
a way to get you all

240
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,438
into a very exclusive
movie premiere tonight.

241
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:02,842
I'm giving y'all that full,
Hollywood red carpet treatment.

242
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,110
- Amazing.
- Oh, my God.

243
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,855
- Yeah? Like a good date?
- I've never done it!

244
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,946
I've never been...

245
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,090
- Never been
to a movie premiere?

246
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,549
No, I'm so excited.

247
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,718
- I feel so good.

248
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,954
The best part is having Zach
by my side.

249
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,421
- Here you go, my love.
- Thank you.

250
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,391
This is a great date so far.

251
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,459
I'm excited.

252
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,001
- Today, the guys
are just at home,

253
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,470
so to be able to strengthen
these connections,

254
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,672
I would like more time
with them.

255
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,174
Hi.
- We know her.

256
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,010
Oh!

257
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,144
- Whoa.
- Hi!

258
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,579
- Yo.
- How is...

259
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,948
Oh, my God, you guys
just do this all day?

260
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,116
So cas.

261
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,952
What's so scary
about falling in love

262
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,823
is that you are making yourself
so vulnerable.

263
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,291
Surprise.

264
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,793
I don't want to date someone
who's not sure about me.

265
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,794
Hi.

266
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,030
So I'm really excited to see

267
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,431
who shows effort

268
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,533
and who's showing
they are here for me.

269
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,968
I know this can work.

270
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,736
I'm so excited for it to work.

271
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,305
Oh, my God, surprise.

272
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,440
- What's up?
- Nothing.

273
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:08,984
It seems like you're
enjoying yourself.

274
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,844
This is nice.
What do you do all day?

275
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,178
- This.
- Yeah?

276
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,446
- We eat food, work out.

277
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,753
- We, like, throw the football.

278
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,858
Tan.
- Like, this is most...

279
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,417
- Not throw the football.

280
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,719
- Yo, Ethan, throw the football!

281
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:20,720
- Ooh.
- Whoa.

282
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,889
- Oh!
- Fumble.

283
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:23,890
I know what that means.
- Every time you miss the ball,

284
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,258
it's a shot.
- Uh-oh.

285
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,259
- Hold up, this went crazy.

286
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,260
- Oh, God.
- I don't...

287
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,661
- Oh!
- That looked

288
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,663
like it was actually
coming in hot.

289
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,535
- Oh.
- Meatball.

290
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,239
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, there it is.

291
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,673
That was a nice redemption.

292
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,876
I don't want to play anymore.

293
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:45,745
I didn't want to play to start.

294
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,415
It's kind of frustrating

295
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,517
the men aren't being

296
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,918
super forward with me.

297
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,062
- Good guy.
- That's pretty nice.

298
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,330
- Oh, you like it?
Bro, I got this

299
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,623
from Mexico, bro,
when I went on a wedding trip.

300
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,128
- Um, so...

301
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,764
There's some guys who
are just kind of proceeding,

302
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,999
like, blasé.

303
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,376
"Whatever, I get to date
two girls."

304
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,835
That's not what this is about.

305
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:13,273
And the lack of effort
is a decision at this point.

306
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,141
Like, it just doesn't show
initiative.

307
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,519
It doesn't show
that you're ready.

308
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,212
Oh, thank you.
- You have a great day.

309
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:24,284
I feel like
I'm giving so much to them,

310
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,320
and, like, they're not giving
everything back.

311
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,523
My expectations are so high

312
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,326
that I'm terrified
to be let down.

313
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,576
- Okay, I'm gonna be
real with you.

314
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,136
So there are two women
in the house now.

315
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,872
Like, there is Gabby as well.

316
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,807
How do you know if you have
feelings for her?

317
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:51,144
Like, is she completely
off the table for you?

318
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,647
It was crazy because I had
this feeling with you

319
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,249
almost right out the gate.

320
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,551
I felt that there was sparks,
or chemistry,

321
00:11:58,618 --> 00:11:59,953
or whatever you want to call it.

322
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,888
And I just knew in that moment

323
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,432
it didn't matter that
there were two Bachelorettes.

324
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,425
Like, I...
I felt something with you.

325
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,894
And, um...
- Good answer.

326
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,729
- Girlfriend, if this
is not the one...

327
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,331
Like, literally, I'm happy

328
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,166
that I'm sending you
on this date.

329
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,968
This is gonna be good.
Thank God.

330
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,169
'Cause I was like,

331
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,613
who else we gonna get out here
if you fail?

332
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,740
So this is great
that you are doing so well.

333
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,375
- Oh, my...
- Exactly.

334
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,576
- This is a great day.

335
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,346
Rachel is beautiful and amazing.

336
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,114
This whole experience has been

337
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,216
something I couldn't
even have imagined.

338
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,685
There's a lot of emotion
and a lot of feelings

339
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,220
and new experiences.

340
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,555
- Come on out.

341
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,626
Ow!

342
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,094
All right.
- We kind of match.

343
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,829
- Roar.
- Ooh.

344
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,264
- It's not easy to open up,

345
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,733
and she's made it,
you know, so much easier

346
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,769
for me as I'm doing stuff
that's out of my comfort zone.

347
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,938
- Oh, my...
- Yes!

348
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,474
- Let me see.
- Look at you.

349
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,110
I think everything we've done
so far today

350
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,454
has made me feel
really confident

351
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,580
about moving forward with Rachel

352
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,982
and really exploring each other.

353
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,117
- Oh, yes.

354
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,885
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, yes.

355
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:10,123
Tonight is a big, special,
VIP movie night for them.

356
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,825
I cannot wait to see them
strut their stuff

357
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,027
on the red carpet.

358
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,263
Three, two, one.
Come on out.

359
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,434
- Oh.
- Oh, my...

360
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:24,937
- You look good.
- Look at you.

361
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,807
- You like it?
- Oh, my... no, I love it.

362
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,642
Ooh, I love?

363
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,411
He loves it.

364
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,955
You look great.
You look very handsome.

365
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,580
- You look like a movie star.

366
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,283
- Thank you.
- Seriously.

367
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,718
- I think this might be it.

368
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:39,819
- I think this is it.

369
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,654
- This is it?
- This is it, yeah.

370
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:44,590
Wow.

371
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,126
- I have to say,
you both look gorgeous.

372
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,728
This is what I wanted.

373
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,963
These two look
really good together.

374
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,865
If all it takes
is for you to look good

375
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,167
to say it's a match,

376
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,036
my baby, this is a match.

377
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,646
- Right now,
I'm just kind of in my head.

378
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,884
Going to the house today
was kind of weird.

379
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,220
Nobody really showed initiative,

380
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,488
and I was hurt.

381
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,490
I was.

382
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,625
I deserve to be loved,

383
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,427
but do I deserve to be loved

384
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,530
by the person
I want to be loved by?

385
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,101
'Cause it seems like the people

386
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,003
that I wanted to love me didn't.

387
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,982
And I don't want to, like,
give my whole heart

388
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,510
to someone just to have it,
like, broken again.

389
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,180
But I know that it's, like,

390
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,816
with great risk
comes great reward.

391
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,421
- Someone at the door.

392
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,189
- I think because of everything

393
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,391
that I've been through,

394
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,460
I just feel my feelings
so deeply.

395
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,797
And it truly is
a blessing and a curse,

396
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:01,167
'cause I think
it hurts way more.

397
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,969
- Ah, there's the card.

398
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:07,306
- Oh, damn.
- Ooh.

399
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:11,010
- It's scary doing this,
like, week after week.

400
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,013
I don't know if I have
the capacity

401
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,182
to either keep breaking
people's hearts

402
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,185
or to potentially
have mine broken.

403
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,087
- "Erich..."

404
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:26,492
"Who said three's a crowd?
Love, Gabby."

405
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,163
- I'm ecstatic.

406
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,697
And I'm not gonna sleep tonight.

407
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,065
I'm super pumped.

408
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,202
- I think it does take
kind of the right person

409
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,670
to know how to love me.

410
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,216
We're in a limo,
drinking champagne.

411
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,151
- Only fitting to go
to a movie premiere

412
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,053
in Hollywood.
- Whoo.

413
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,492
Oh, my...

414
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,960
- "Me and You"?

415
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,062
- No.
- Wait...

416
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,997
- Oh, my God.

417
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,868
- Let's go.
- Oh, my God.

418
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,369
- Let's go.
- What?

419
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,238
- Rachel, Zach, look here.
- Let's go.

420
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,708
Let's go.

421
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,743
- Rachel, over here!

422
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,479
- Oh, my damn.

423
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,315
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

424
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,918
- Wow.

425
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,389
- Look here, Rachel.
Look here.

426
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,858
- Rachel!
- Hey, Zach.

427
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,393
- This is so incredible.

428
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,330
Having Zach by my side
is so perfect.

429
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,832
And he's just making me
feel comfortable

430
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,435
in a situation
I've never been in before.

431
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,004
- Kisses? Mm.

432
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,607
Oh, my gosh.

433
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,318
- I mean, it felt
like we were movie stars.

434
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,910
It was so fun.

435
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,645
Little twirl?

436
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,947
Ooh.
- Whoo.

437
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,617
- She was looking stunning,
as usual.

438
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,372
This all feels like a dream,

439
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,721
to be honest.

440
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,958
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh.

441
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,429
What's going on?
- I don't know.

442
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,866
- It's so quiet.
- Wait, are we sitting there?

443
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,836
Oh!
- Oh, my goodness.

444
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,807
What?

445
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,781
- "I hope this is the beginning
of your love story.

446
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,183
Enjoy the movie.
Karamo."

447
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,752
- Wow.

448
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,154
I can't wait.
- Oh, my gosh.

449
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,989
- This is crazy.
This is...

450
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,926
- We have
our own private viewing.

451
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,421
- Wow.

452
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,262
Oh, my God.

453
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,868
- Rachel!

454
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,039
- I'm speechless.

455
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,409
- I... I don't even know
what to say.

456
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,646
Watching the videos
of Rachel growing up,

457
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,181
was completely shocked.

458
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:38,417
Like, that's the last thing
that I expected.

459
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,886
- Say, "Congratulations,
Auntie Mary and Uncle John."

460
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,588
- Congratulations.

461
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,824
Oh, that...

462
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:48,961
- Oh, my God.

463
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,005
- That moment we shared
was something special.

464
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,841
And I got to see, you know,
what her life was back then.

465
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,377
And that's something
that not everyone gets to see.

466
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:09,215
And I didn't expect
anything like that.

467
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,317
Zach, man.

468
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,788
Zachary. Zach.

469
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,491
It's your first Halloween!

470
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,726
What do you think, Zach?

471
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,631
You having fun?

472
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,636
Hi, Zach,

473
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,605
just letting you know
that we love and miss you.

474
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,507
And we're so excited for you.

475
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:35,908
And you're really just looking

476
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,610
to find your true forever love.

477
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,811
But I hope you find someone

478
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,446
that loves you unconditionally

479
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,181
and is also your best friend.

480
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,850
Take chances,
but stay true to yourself.

481
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,652
And Twix and Bella miss you too.

482
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,120
Love you. Bye.

483
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:52,992
- When I see Zach's reaction
to his mom,

484
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,361
I'm, like, trying so hard
not to cry

485
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,830
because it's, like,
so beautiful.

486
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,633
Watching him as a child

487
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,469
and hearing his mom talk
about him,

488
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:07,239
I really just feel so much,
like, closer to him.

489
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,443
It's really special.

490
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,012
- My baby girl,

491
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:17,483
I barely got you back again,
and you're already gone.

492
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,719
But I know this time
you're gonna find the man

493
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,854
who's gonna capture your heart.

494
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,255
And when I see you next,

495
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,599
you're gonna have
the biggest smile

496
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,359
on your face
with a fiancé on the way.

497
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,463
And all I can do
is wish you the best,

498
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,798
all the happiness in the world.

499
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:36,936
So, baby, just live it,
love it, and have fun.

500
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,304
I love you.

501
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,706
Oh, my gosh.

502
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,775
- I'm, like, trying to not cry.

503
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,076
Like...

504
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,616
Wow.

505
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:00,392
You were a cute kid.

506
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,028
How did it feel, seeing that?

507
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,630
- Oh.

508
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,366
Obviously it stirred up
a lot of emotions.

509
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,768
Yeah.

510
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,837
I'm, like, the luckiest son
in the world, so...

511
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,740
That's so awesome.
- So I saw your mom.

512
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,343
Are you close with your dad
as well?

513
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,346
- Yeah, so I'm...
I'm very close, you know,

514
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,347
with my dad.

515
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,482
And, you know, one crazy thing

516
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:27,520
about this whole, you know,
journey is, you know,

517
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,055
he... he was an aspiring pilot.

518
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,658
He wanted to become
a military pilot.

519
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,860
He loves planes so much so

520
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,663
that when we were kids,

521
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,532
he would just drive us
to any airport...

522
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,699
- Stop.

523
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,043
- And we would sit...
- Are you ser...

524
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,411
- In the park... like,
a parking lot of an airport,

525
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,480
and he... we would just watch
planes take off and land.

526
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,339
And he would name
every single one of them.

527
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,508
- I did that with my dad.
- You're kidding me.

528
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:52,111
- No, I'm literally, like,
tearing right now.

529
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:53,698
- You actually did that?
- Like... yes.

530
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,183
That's...

531
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,519
I've never heard or met anyone
that's done the same thing.

532
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,421
That's...
- This is literally...

533
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:06,025
This is wild.

534
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,328
- Oh, my gosh,
this is just so crazy.

535
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:11,931
I feel like I kn...

536
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,201
Like, have spent
weeks with you already.

537
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,002
- Yeah?
- This has been so incredible.

538
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,806
- This has been absolutely

539
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:23,075
one of the best nights
of my life.

540
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,877
- Same.

541
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,689
- Tonight was incredible.

542
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,358
I really do believe
that we really did start

543
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,860
the beginning of our love story.

544
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,294
And...

545
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:45,831
I think Rachel could be
my future wife.

546
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,667
- I have a surprise.

547
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,302
- More surprises?
- Yeah.

548
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,937
Do you want to dance?

549
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:55,541
- This is crazy to say out loud

550
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:58,110
and actually think about,
considering how early it is,

551
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:01,080
but it's very real.

552
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,217
What's going on, it's very real.

553
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,535
I'm falling for her.

554
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,841
I'm falling for her,
really, really hard.

555
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,779
Um... yeah.

556
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:38,484
- Zach, will you accept
this rose?

557
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,019
- Absolutely.
- Okay, good.

558
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,154
Thank God.
- Absolutely.

559
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,957
I'm so relieved.

560
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:47,092
Coming into tonight, was seeing

561
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,762
if Zach and I could connect
emotionally.

562
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:53,198
And to see him get emotional
seeing his family,

563
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,134
I definitely think we have

564
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,337
an emotional connection,
a physical connection.

565
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:06,245
To be able to be blessed
to be in this position,

566
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:07,713
to find love again,

567
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,948
and to be experiencing it

568
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,884
with, like... like,
unconditional love

569
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:15,020
with someone like Zach
next to me is just

570
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,922
truly, like, so special.

571
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,297
This is all about finding love.

572
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:26,999
And it just feels like

573
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,301
a really, like, beautiful start

574
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:32,004
to, like, what could be
something really amazing.

575
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:54,059
- My journey thus far,
it hasn't been easy.

576
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:58,764
Going to the house yesterday
obviously backfired.

577
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:03,335
I left feeling upset and sad,

578
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:06,605
wondering if these guys
are truly interested in me.

579
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,677
But today,
I'm just looking forward

580
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:12,945
to spending time with Erich.

581
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,813
We always have
a good time together.

582
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,348
- This is a big day.

583
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:17,692
This is, like,
the make or break.

584
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,718
- I'm really excited,

585
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,955
but also a little apprehensive.

586
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:26,025
Will he be able to accept me
for me?

587
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,094
Hi!
- Hey, Gabby. Hey.

588
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:30,462
- How are you?
- Good.

589
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,639
- You look good today.
- It's good to see you.

590
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,332
Thank you. You do too.

591
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,700
Hi.

592
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:37,036
I feel like I live here.

593
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,038
- Erich's date card said
"Three's a crowd."

594
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,682
So who's the third, you know?
- Yeah. Yeah.

595
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,641
- I'm, like, getting
kind of nervous now.

596
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,443
Yeah, you should be.

597
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,345
The legend.

598
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:52,317
- Oh, hey, kid.
How you doing?

599
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,021
- You guys, I think you know
who this is.

600
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,423
This is my grandpa.

601
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,590
America's grandpa.

602
00:25:58,657 --> 00:25:59,901
- Who are all these guys?
- Grandpa?

603
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,161
They're all my boyfriends.

604
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,462
- I was shocked.

605
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,597
I was like,
"No. There's just no way."

606
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,000
Have you got a date for me?

607
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,170
- , come on.
- This is about me.

608
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,371
- Oh, wait a minute.

609
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:13,681
- It's really about to be
a two-on-one

610
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,007
with, like, a family member.

611
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,075
This early.

612
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,543
Like, it's unprecedented.

613
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,111
- Yeah, all right, shall we?

614
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:20,712
Bye.
- Bye-bye.

615
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,081
Bye.

616
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,192
- So you know what we're doing
buy I don't.

617
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,085
- I do know.
- I don't think that's fair.

618
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,219
- I know it's early,

619
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,288
but I think it'll be nice
to be able to see

620
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,590
how Erich interacts
with my family.

621
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,659
Let's hit it.
- Bye!

622
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:39,498
This is really beautiful
country, I've gotta admit.

623
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,200
- I know, it's so green here.

624
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:45,938
Grandpa John is really great
in so many ways.

625
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,874
He's been married
for 50 plus years.

626
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,843
So he's a great guy
to have around.

627
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,578
And he really loves me.

628
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,046
I really appreciate that.

629
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,416
- So my grandpa's approval
on Erich

630
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:58,584
will mean the world to me.

631
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:00,595
- So now you're living
here in California?

632
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,887
- Yeah, I just moved.

633
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,198
You should come hang out
with me in Santa Monica.

634
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,323
- What's in Santa Monica?

635
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,191
- Beaches.
- Good-looking chicks?

636
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:09,161
- Grandpa.
You are a pervert.

637
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,539
- I've never been
on a first date

638
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,365
where somebody's grandpa's
been there.

639
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:15,067
So it's definitely not natural.

640
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,669
But he's a really funny,
charismatic guy.

641
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,104
It is special that he's here.

642
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,273
Where do you think we are?

643
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,208
- I have no freaking idea
where we are.

644
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,513
Oh, what is this?

645
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,947
- Welcome.

646
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,215
- Thank you.

647
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:31,550
- My name is Kirsha.

648
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:34,186
I'm gonna be
your sound ceremony host today.

649
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,188
Before we get started,

650
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:38,157
I'm gonna do
an energetic clearing on you,

651
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,659
which just helps to release

652
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,861
any negative energy's
auric field.

653
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,200
- One of my favorite things
is a sound bath,

654
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:49,902
'cause it's very grounding.

655
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,737
- I'd like to invite you
to turn around.

656
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,906
- It's just what I need
to have a reset

657
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,942
to get myself out of my head.

658
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,310
I think I've personally been

659
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:00,479
a little overwhelmed
these last couple days.

660
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:02,581
- We're gonna start

661
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:04,783
with an intention-setting
ceremony.

662
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,118
- I can go first.

663
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:09,121
Okay.

664
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:14,193
Um, I would like to set
an intention of moving forward

665
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,994
in this journey with confidence

666
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:19,031
despite any fears I may have.

667
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,066
Because I truly believe

668
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,769
that the risk
is worth the reward.

669
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,438
Being the Bachelorette,
I've had so many doubts.

670
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:27,940
I've been scared as hell,

671
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,541
feeling that I'm not good enough

672
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,310
to be in this role.

673
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,012
- My intentions is presence.

674
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,514
Just being here in the moment.

675
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,316
- Being in love is so scary

676
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,052
because you're trusting someone
with your whole heart.

677
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,324
- So trusting myself
and my heart with Erich,

678
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,226
I think, is a big step for me.

679
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,603
- John, you're welcome
to rejoin us

680
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,238
whenever you feel ready.

681
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,039
- "Rejoin us" how?

682
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,411
Oh, jeez.

683
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,613
- What on Earth?

684
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,014
Interesting.

685
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,749
That was an interesting
experience, yeah.

686
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:12,751
- I thank you
for placing trust in me

687
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:14,453
to guide you
through this ceremony.

688
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,821
- I mean, at my age,

689
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,990
any new experience
is a good experience.

690
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,092
Not something
that I'd necessarily

691
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,094
ever have to duplicate again.

692
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,062
Okay, where's my beer?

693
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,004
- Wow.

694
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,507
Grandpa, I think
maybe we should do teams.

695
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:37,943
Let's see.

696
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,177
Hi.

697
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:41,847
Do you want to bowl
with my grandpa and I

698
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,316
- and my date?
- Sure.

699
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,251
Are you me?

700
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,619
- This is Julie.
- Julie?

701
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:49,721
- Hi, Julie. How are you?
I'm Grandpa.

702
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,922
- I'm Grandma.

703
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,293
- So I got a date. Ooh.
- That's right.

704
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,460
- We got this.

705
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,029
- Okay, here we go.

706
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,530
- Don't get any ideas.

707
00:29:58,597 --> 00:29:59,598
Are you me?

708
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:01,667
I'm too old to have ideas.

709
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,735
- So far, today has been great.

710
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,839
And it really feels
like a normal family day.

711
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,742
Erich is rising to the occasion.

712
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,843
Oh!

713
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,779
He seems like he's into me.

714
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,114
Oh, my God!

715
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,849
It didn't feel
like a normal first date

716
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,319
where I felt
like I had to impress him.

717
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,688
It seemed like he was
really down with everything.

718
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,323
Just really easy to be around.

719
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,293
- This day has been, like,
a lot of fun.

720
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,561
It's been, like,

721
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,196
senior citizens bowling tour,
literally.

722
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,531
Yeah.

723
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:33,597
Yeah.

724
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,035
I think we have to have a moment

725
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,304
away from whatever that is.

726
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:40,371
I agree.

727
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:53,961
There's nothing like making out
in a bowling alley.

728
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,054
- With a bunch of teenagers
and old people.

729
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,241
All right, we'll keep it PG.

730
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:58,666
- It does make you feel
like a teenager.

731
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,892
It's kind of fun.

732
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,037
- I was lucky that we just,
like, have this connection,

733
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,030
we hit it off,
because I don't know

734
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:06,598
if I've had that with Rachel.

735
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:09,768
- Today with Erich
was definitely as good

736
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,203
as I hoped.

737
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,771
He did great with my grandpa.

738
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:14,506
You've got it.

739
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,718
- I'm, like... I come out of this
and I have a new grandma.

740
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,110
- He's like,
"I got a hotel room."

741
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,244
Right!

742
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,715
This week has been hard.

743
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:24,816
- Oh, my God.

744
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,963
- I know. Isn't this crazy?

745
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,319
- This is unbelievable.

746
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,722
- I've been in my head,
questioning everything.

747
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:31,957
- Is there another table

748
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,468
that Grandpa John's
gonna pull up with?

749
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,093
Yeah.

750
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,530
But I'm feeling, like,
overall good.

751
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:42,100
I know I do really have
a connection with Erich.

752
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:44,770
And I might not be
perfect tonight,

753
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,538
but hopefully he's patient
with me,

754
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:49,007
'cause that's the only thing
I can really ask for.

755
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,251
I had an amazing day.

756
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,410
- Me too.
- Cheers.

757
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,080
- Some parts were interesting
for me.

758
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,048
Yeah, same.

759
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,117
- Like, you really do make this
so easy.

760
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,753
And, like, I really just want
to value the time

761
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,656
that... that we have to see
if... if there is,

762
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:07,592
you know, a deeper connection,
if that is a possibility.

763
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,736
- Yeah, yeah.
- And, like, I know...

764
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,037
I feel like we're kind of
on the same page

765
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,263
where it's, like...
- Yeah.

766
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,264
- It might take a minute

767
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,598
to get there, but...
- Right.

768
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:14,742
- To know
the possibility's there,

769
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,134
like, that's what's exciting
to me.

770
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,369
- Yeah, totally.

771
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,237
A lot of relationships
is effort,

772
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,481
which people take for granted.
- Yeah.

773
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,107
- But...
- It's easy to give up.

774
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:23,175
- Yeah.
- And just to...

775
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,485
To just not, like, fight
through it.

776
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,421
And growing up, you know,
you see your parents...

777
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:27,379
- Yeah.
- And that was one thing

778
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,547
my mom said, she's like,

779
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,991
"I'll always fight for him
no matter what."

780
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:31,183
And, I mean, that...

781
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,760
- Have... do they, like,
ever not get along?

782
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,228
- Obviously, yeah.
- Have you... yeah.

783
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:35,296
- They fought all the time.
- Well, I don't know, like,

784
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,055
how much they, like, show you.

785
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,591
- So, like, my... my dad is
this, like, larger-than-life,

786
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,293
big personality.

787
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,470
Like, the most stubborn
son of a bitch

788
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:43,829
you'll ever meet.

789
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,163
- And my mom is this, like...

790
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,307
The hardest-working person
I've ever met

791
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,432
in my entire life.
- Mm.

792
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:48,709
- And they have this, like,
deep love.

793
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,969
I mean, they are
absolutely soul mates.

794
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,537
They're just, like,
the best team.

795
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:53,848
- Yeah.
- That I've ever seen. And...

796
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:55,607
- Yeah.
- I know it's a lot to ask for,

797
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,452
but it's... that's, like...
That's what I want.

798
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,311
- Yeah.
I think it's important too,

799
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:03,014
'cause I think I still have,
like, fears built-in

800
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:06,751
that I constantly have
to, like, sit down,

801
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,919
assess, and fight.

802
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,956
And I'm reserved
to share that with people,

803
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,058
because I've been hurt
so many times,

804
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,026
like, by a parent.
- Yeah.

805
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:18,163
- And I think, like, that's
kind of the hardest love

806
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,800
to not ever have received.
- Yeah.

807
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:26,338
Growing up, my mom kind of...
We're estranged.

808
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,340
I don't have a relationship
with her.

809
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,175
- I'm sorry.
- She, like... no, that's okay.

810
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:33,311
Um, she definitely did
the best she could.

811
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:36,548
But the second I moved
out of the house,

812
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:38,850
she, like, wiped her hands,
like, clean.

813
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:41,453
So it... I mean, it is...

814
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,089
Like, I obviously get emotional
talking about it.

815
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,757
- Yeah.
- But it...

816
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,626
I'll, like, maybe never know

817
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,528
what it's like to, like,
have a mother's love.

818
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:54,299
And it's something, like,
that's hard and I'll miss.

819
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,810
Just give me a second.

820
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:09,841
- I'm overwhelmed.

821
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,978
What if I can't do it?

822
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,717
Like, people, like want
to see the Rachels

823
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,219
'cause she's easier.

824
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,822
I'm too complicated.

825
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,758
It's like, I'm messy.

826
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,169
I think, tonight,

827
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,206
the pressure of being
the Bachelorette just...

828
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,341
It really hit me.

829
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:45,510
Like, what did I get
myself into?

830
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,512
Can I do it?
Is it too much?

831
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,382
Can I truly find love?

832
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,152
It is, like, so hard for me.

833
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:56,187
I feel like I'm
incredibly different

834
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:59,324
than other women
who've walked in my shoes.

835
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:01,026
I don't always want to explain

836
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,328
my situation to people.

837
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:04,863
It's really, really hard.

838
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,431
And I can see myself

839
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,033
still having guards
and walls up,

840
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,370
because, um, I'm afraid of him

841
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:13,972
and what we might have.

842
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:17,242
But I think being able
to recognize it is...

843
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,145
Is the first step,
and then hopefully I can

844
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,048
move forward knowing that.

845
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:26,418
Thank you for everything
and being here.

846
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,622
There's, like, a big part of me

847
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,925
that worries
and is really scared

848
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:36,995
that, like, people aren't gonna
be able to resonate with me.

849
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:41,132
And when we sat down initially,
like, and talked,

850
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,468
I was really just, like,
so scared.

851
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,937
- Yeah.
- This is a huge honor,

852
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,572
and I don't want to it up.

853
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,040
And I'm not polished.

854
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:51,543
I'm not like anyone
they've seen in the past.

855
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,378
I'm not like Rachel.

856
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,146
Not that I'm comparing
myself to her,

857
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,282
'cause I think we're both,
like, very different.

858
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,817
But...

859
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,086
I didn't ever think

860
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,487
that this would really get
to me.

861
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,657
And then, I think this week,
like...

862
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,193
it's all landed so heavy.
Like...

863
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,996
Am I the right person,
basically, for this?

864
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,465
- Yeah.
- And I think there's

865
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,800
still lots of, like, navigating.

866
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,869
And I'm sure I'll, like,
ebb and flow,

867
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:22,340
but the last thing I want
to do is not be who I am.

868
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,245
- It sounds like,
from your situation, that you...

869
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,214
Like, you've become, like,
really in tune

870
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,815
with your emotions.

871
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,084
And, you know, you've had
a much different upbringing.

872
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:36,154
And I think it's shaped you
as a really unique person.

873
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:39,257
- Yeah.
I think it has truly made me,

874
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:42,160
like, the woman I am today,
which I'm really proud of.

875
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,028
- Yeah.
- But I do have

876
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,097
such a severely emotional side.

877
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:48,533
Like, maybe... I don't know,
even with my friends.

878
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,269
Like, with Rachel...
Like, when I love people,

879
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:52,604
I love them to a point

880
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,205
where it, like, literally hurts.

881
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,407
- Yeah.
- You know? But I think

882
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:59,544
I'm lucky
that because of my past

883
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,112
I have that capacity...
- Yeah.

884
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:04,182
- To be able to love
that deeply.

885
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:06,584
And, like, believe me,
I just want to have fun.

886
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,753
- I know.
- Like, you know,

887
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,356
forever and ever,
but, like, there's...

888
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,558
To you too, like, there's
so many different sides

889
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,959
that you just, like...
- I know.

890
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,095
- Want your partner to know.
- No, trust me. I know.

891
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:20,131
And I will be as open
and honest with you.

892
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:22,367
And I want you to do the same.

893
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,369
- Yeah.
- Because, like, I only have

894
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,670
so much time with you here.

895
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,940
And I... I really like you.

896
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,543
And I will not hold
anything back.

897
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,179
And as much as you want
out of me, I'm willing to give.

898
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,647
And I'm... I'm...

899
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,382
I'm here to see where this goes.

900
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,450
And I don't... I don't have
any expectations

901
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:42,020
or anything of you,
but I want you to be honest.

902
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,521
I think that's
why we're both here.

903
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:44,856
- Yeah, yeah.

904
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:48,226
- I'm trying to get
comfortable with it.

905
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:53,064
But seriously...

906
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:09,314
- Thank you for everything
and being here.

907
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,750
We can go get warm.

908
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,153
I'd love... love to.

909
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,823
I think tonight was, like,

910
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,092
a huge turning point in growth.

911
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,962
And, like, having...
Taking a break,

912
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,763
regrouping, and coming back,

913
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:29,734
we connected like I never,
ever, ever would have asked.

914
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,871
I didn't expect things
to be this hard this soon.

915
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,505
I really didn't.

916
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,308
But, ultimately,
I think it's left us

917
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,378
in, like, a way better place.
- Yeah.

918
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:42,280
So...

919
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:44,682
With that being said,

920
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:48,353
Erich,
will you accept this rose?

921
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,288
- I would love to accept
this rose.

922
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,264
- Today with Erich
was one of the best days

923
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,733
I've had so far.

924
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:04,002
My feelings for him get deeper

925
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,504
and deeper and deeper
every time.

926
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,974
And it's scary as hell.

927
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,477
Who knows what's to come?

928
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,379
I do just want to get
on your lap,

929
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,215
'cause I feel like
I can get closer to you.

930
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:19,851
Is that close enough?

931
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,989
- I'm the imperfect
Bachelorette,

932
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,859
but I think
in some people's eyes

933
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,061
it'll mean perfect.

934
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,697
And Erich, tonight,
really, really, really

935
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,566
really, really, let me
lean into that,

936
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,769
and understand it,
and be myself.

937
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,204
'Cause I would give anything

938
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,674
to be loved
by someone like Erich.

939
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,522
- Oh, my God!

940
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:58,856
- Hello.

941
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,491
- You guys look amazing.

942
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,026
- Thank you.

943
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,028
- So beautiful.

944
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:05,797
- Today's the 19-on-2 date,

945
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,332
the biggest in Bachelor history,

946
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,567
which is crazy.

947
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,336
- Today, no one is a bridesmaid.

948
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,504
Everyone is a bride.

949
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,307
- I think this week has
brought me so much clarity.

950
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,810
I am a little timid
about being the Bachelorette.

951
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,244
I have my own fears,

952
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,481
but I've been proven
with Nate and with Erich,

953
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:25,216
that one conversation,

954
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:28,086
one day can really change
your whole experience.

955
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,488
- Perfect.
- So today,

956
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:32,523
I'm hoping to see
these guys' personality

957
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,993
and to see how much effort
they're truly willing to show,

958
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,096
not just in the activity,
but towards Rachel and I.

959
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,731
- Whoa.
- Whoa, do you see that?

960
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:42,066
- Let's go!

961
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:43,234
- Oh, my God.

962
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:44,902
When I say Gabby
in a wedding dress,

963
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,738
my heart's, like,
beating out of my chest.

964
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,406
Like, it felt like
I was getting ready

965
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:50,208
to go into shock.

966
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,076
Oh! Oh, hi.

967
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:53,811
Wow.

968
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,313
- Hi!

969
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,814
- You look like
a Disney princess.

970
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:59,117
- Oh, my goodness.
- The date card said,

971
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,386
"Who do you picture
yourself with?"

972
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,187
- Hi.
- But they're both

973
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,894
great women,
and I'm like, it's completely

974
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:05,957
up in the air right now.

975
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,560
Ohh!

976
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,263
- I think everyone just saw
their wife for the first time,

977
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,432
so if anyone's confused,

978
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:15,843
they're a hundred times
more confused now,

979
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,602
'cause they look
absolutely beautiful.

980
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,237
Yeah.

981
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,806
- Yeah, we're so excited
for a fun day.

982
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,608
I think, as you guys know,

983
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,144
Rachel and I take this
very seriously,

984
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,080
so we're hoping today we can

985
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:31,149
see who we can
picture ourselves with,

986
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:35,319
and what better way than
a classic Bachelor photo shoot?

987
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,790
- Oh.
- We have a Bachelor legend,

988
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,658
icon and artist,

989
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,461
Franco Lacosta, to help us out.

990
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:46,197
- Well, I mean, first of all,
I'm here to help you

991
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:49,634
to really decide, who do
you picture your future with?

992
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,569
So this is gonna be
a lot of fun for me,

993
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:52,804
for them, for all of us.

994
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,372
And now it's time to play.

995
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:55,773
Yes.

996
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,209
- So go and grab your costumes
and get ready,

997
00:42:58,276 --> 00:42:59,544
and give me some good stuff.

998
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,446
Hurry up.
Come on.

999
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,748
- I'm excited, 'cause I haven't
been on a date yet.

1000
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:06,126
I haven't been on a group date,
haven't been on a one-on-one,

1001
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,351
so this is game day.

1002
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,053
Gotta be ready for anything.

1003
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,133
- I'm... I'm right here. Damn,
bro, I got the short-shorts?

1004
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:15,960
I've seen Franco from past
seasons of "The Bachelor,"

1005
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:19,063
and so I think we're gonna be
pushed out of our comfort zone.

1006
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,232
- No way.
- Bro, this looks crazy.

1007
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:22,834
- Oh, my God.
- I just have this?

1008
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,469
Guys, I got a leaf.

1009
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,470
That's it?

1010
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,338
- What?
- That's it?

1011
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:29,874
- I think that in a group
setting, I do best.

1012
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,976
What am I supposed
to do with this?

1013
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:33,845
I mean, I got two switches,

1014
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,180
on and more on.

1015
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,885
- Franco had some
inspiration here.

1016
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,254
I mean, I'm, uh,

1017
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:45,756
dressed up
as a little kid today.

1018
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,792
- Yeah, I'm a baby
for some reason.

1019
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:49,927
I gotta put this on.

1020
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,163
- Meatball was looking
like a big, hairy baby.

1021
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,574
I never... I've never seen
a baby come out

1022
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:55,800
with a beard and chest hair.

1023
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:56,767
- There you go.

1024
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,336
- We got Kirk, uh,

1025
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,838
looks like he just got hit
by a semi truck.

1026
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:03,508
We got some, you know,
some male cowboys,

1027
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:06,310
"Magic Mike" looking,
but not so magic.

1028
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,212
- It's a little breezy
back here.

1029
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:10,515
I don't know if I'm a sexy
patient or a crazy patient.

1030
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,350
All I know
is my ass cheeks are out.

1031
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,328
I don't know what I'm
getting into, but I'ma own it.

1032
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:15,419
I'ma own it.
I'ma make sure

1033
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,788
I come out with a rose today,
for sure.

1034
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:18,923
- You guys look amazing.

1035
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,300
- They look incredible.
- I don't...

1036
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,602
I feel like there's not...
- You guys look great.

1037
00:44:21,626 --> 00:44:23,137
- Enough to the imagination.
- No, no, no.

1038
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,563
Of course, but I did want
you guys to look delicious,

1039
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,132
and you look all yummy!

1040
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,399
The first photo we're gonna do
is gonna be the car wash.

1041
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:33,938
- A Daisy Duke car wash.

1042
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,573
- And be sexy, eh?

1043
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,675
Come on, get on each other.

1044
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:39,243
Oh, I love that.

1045
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,245
Oh, my God.

1046
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:43,481
- Gabby, these boys are dirty,
dirty, dirty.

1047
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:44,548
Clean them up.

1048
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:47,919
- The car wash is hilarious.

1049
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,954
I feel like the guys
are really embracing it.

1050
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:51,856
- Oh, yeah, sexy.

1051
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:53,457
Yes, oh!

1052
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,726
Wash their scrotum.
Keep doing it.

1053
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,495
It's beautiful.

1054
00:44:57,562 --> 00:45:00,631
- It definitely put the guys
outside of their comfort zone.

1055
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,866
- It's okay.
- Aah!

1056
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:03,201
Am I dilated?

1057
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,478
- Do you see the baby?
- Oh, my God.

1058
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:05,946
- Baby coming out.
- Oh, no, it's coming!

1059
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,548
- It's coming? Oh, my gosh.
Rachel's the father.

1060
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:10,208
First time in human history,
so exciting stuff.

1061
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:11,676
I'm cramped... cramping.
- Ohh!

1062
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:13,110
- It's kicking.
- Oh, no!

1063
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:15,513
- We're delivering now.
Come on, baby Meatball.

1064
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,620
Wah, wah, wah!

1065
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:21,118
- I could see myself
having a child with Aven,

1066
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,054
and I hope it looks
like Meatball.

1067
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,489
- Guys, this is all
about the family, you guys.

1068
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,058
Yeah, Power Rangers!

1069
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,427
Yeah, this is beautiful
for Grandma.

1070
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:32,230
- That's a beautiful family.
Aww.

1071
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,698
- I'm team Gabby all the way.

1072
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,132
She looks...
She looks really good,

1073
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,710
and I'm just happy to see
that she's smiling

1074
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,345
and having a good time
with the group date.

1075
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:41,205
- Rachel is a badass pilot.

1076
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:43,174
- Buckle up, everybody.
- Spencer,

1077
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,875
grab her... ach... eat her face.

1078
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:46,720
- I feel like I'm in
the Bermuda Triangle right now

1079
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,913
because I was kind of leaning
towards Gabby, right,

1080
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,449
but I... I think Rachel might
have been flirting with me,

1081
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,884
and I don't think they know
who I'm flirting with

1082
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,886
because I'm trying
to flirt with both still.

1083
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,288
It's kind of a mess.

1084
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:58,522
- I have three patients?

1085
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,733
- Can you help me out please?

1086
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,025
I picture myself with Gabby,

1087
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,569
getting married at the end
of all of this,

1088
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,929
so I think I need Gabby
to check my vitals.

1089
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:06,264
- Oh, my God.

1090
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,566
We have a rogue patient!

1091
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,168
- The photo shoot
is so much fun.

1092
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,771
These guys are really
putting themselves out there

1093
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:16,173
and revealing so much.

1094
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,442
- Hey, Jacob.

1095
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,677
- I'm ready for my close-up.

1096
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:20,911
- Wow.

1097
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,647
- Whoa. Are you Adam?

1098
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:23,814
- Amazing.
- Are you Eve?

1099
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:24,915
- Yeah.
- Ohh.

1100
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,784
- Amazing.
Just don't get excited.

1101
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:28,953
We don't want this leaf
to fly away.

1102
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,421
- So I got some forbidden fruit

1103
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:31,589
that the ladies can have.

1104
00:46:31,656 --> 00:46:34,025
- Okay, you guys, look at me.

1105
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,360
- I don't know if they're
gonna want it this early,

1106
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:37,662
but it is tasty.

1107
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,830
- Oh, exactly. So beautiful.

1108
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:40,998
- Ah, there it is.

1109
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:42,400
Ohh.

1110
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:46,137
- I've seen Jacob's situation
multiple times today.

1111
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,172
And it scares me...
- Whoo.

1112
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,641
- Because I just can't
stop looking.

1113
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,777
- Delicious.

1114
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,313
It is the time
for the final shoot,

1115
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:56,747
for the proposal.

1116
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,316
Tino, come here.

1117
00:46:58,382 --> 00:46:59,550
Whoo!

1118
00:46:59,617 --> 00:47:01,018
- Logan!

1119
00:47:01,085 --> 00:47:03,688
- I'm sure Rachel
could be the one,

1120
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:07,358
and I don't care if anybody's
looking, anybody's watching,

1121
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:08,993
I'm going for it.

1122
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,295
Rachel, the way I feel
with you I want forever.

1123
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:13,864
Oh, my God.

1124
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,499
- Amazing.

1125
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,001
Okay, Logan.

1126
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:18,569
- Rachel?
- Yes?

1127
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:19,680
Are you gonna ask me something?

1128
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:20,744
- Will you marry me? Yeah.

1129
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:23,541
- My heart.

1130
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,076
- That was beautiful, you guys.

1131
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:26,911
Tyler and Nate.

1132
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,379
- Yeah!

1133
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:29,580
- Coming from a one-on-one

1134
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:30,857
to being in a group environment

1135
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:32,883
is a little bit more difficult,

1136
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,419
but Gabby looks
absolutely radiant,

1137
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:36,987
and I do miss her.

1138
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,365
I think about her a lot,
just because

1139
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,491
our first date was so good.

1140
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:42,326
- Tyler, really just be
in the moment.

1141
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:43,761
Take the time.
This is the picture.

1142
00:47:43,828 --> 00:47:45,262
- What?
- Oh, my gosh.

1143
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,998
You look amazing, and, you know,

1144
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:50,368
I've been waiting for this
moment my entire life.

1145
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,970
- But as long as Gabby's
having fun, I really don't,

1146
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,272
like, get jealous
because I know that, like,

1147
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,041
we still have
our own connection.

1148
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:59,310
- Nate, come on.
- And to me,

1149
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:02,046
Gabby is like
a beautiful ray of sunshine.

1150
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:03,981
- This is your time.
This is your moment.

1151
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,584
This is the precedent
for the rest of your lives.

1152
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,661
Let's do this.

1153
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:08,786
- Aww.

1154
00:48:08,853 --> 00:48:11,889
- I am a thousand
plus a thousand

1155
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:14,658
times a million percent
in on Gabby right now.

1156
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,194
So just trying
to keep the spark going.

1157
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:19,663
Your... your smile melts my heart.

1158
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,098
- Aw.
- It really does.

1159
00:48:21,165 --> 00:48:23,934
Whenever you enter a room,

1160
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,436
the world melts away.

1161
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,606
The second I laid eyes on you,

1162
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:30,741
I felt like I was meeting
my best friend,

1163
00:48:30,808 --> 00:48:33,310
and forever
could never be long enough

1164
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:36,380
to just realize how beautiful
you are inside and out.

1165
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:38,949
- Oh, thank you.

1166
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:41,252
Oh, my God.

1167
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:43,354
I feel a beautiful
connection here.

1168
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:45,423
- Nate makes me feel special
in a way

1169
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:46,924
that nobody else has here,

1170
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:50,828
and right now I feel
so loved and seen.

1171
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,531
I did it.

1172
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,332
- So just having him
next to me today

1173
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:58,169
honestly gives me a sense
of such solid ground.

1174
00:48:58,235 --> 00:48:59,904
Its' really such a good feeling.

1175
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,939
- You guys so beautiful.

1176
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:05,443
- And other men really
just are showing initiative,

1177
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,945
which gives me so much hope.

1178
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:09,980
- Have a wonderful time.
Enjoy the after-party.

1179
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:12,550
- So I can't wait for tonight.

1180
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,519
I know it's gonna be
really incredible.

1181
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:16,586
Bye, you guys.
- Whoo!

1182
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,855
- See you soon.

1183
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:26,664
- Wow.

1184
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,098
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

1185
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:29,633
- We're at SoFi Stadium,

1186
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,969
where the LA Rams
and the LA Chargers play.

1187
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:35,739
The newest, nicest, you know,
insane NFL stadium there is.

1188
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,775
- Wow.

1189
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:39,610
- And it's like, the lights,

1190
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:42,279
two gorgeous women, 19 guys.

1191
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:44,982
- Let's go!

1192
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:47,485
- Every guy was feeling
that tonight may be

1193
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,353
the biggest night
in Bachelor Nation history.

1194
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,355
- Hi.
- Here we go.

1195
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:53,023
- You know,
being here for a date

1196
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:54,725
isn't something you get
to do every day.

1197
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:57,361
- Hi, how's it going?

1198
00:49:57,428 --> 00:49:59,864
- But the one thing I want
tonight is a rose from Gabby.

1199
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,198
That's all that's on my mind.

1200
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:03,200
- Let's go.

1201
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:06,904
- The group date today really
was so great and so special

1202
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:09,340
because it showed me
that I'm building

1203
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,542
really strong connections
with these men,

1204
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:15,246
so I know tonight is going
to be so amazing,

1205
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:19,583
and it'll be nice
to strengthen the connections

1206
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,485
that I think I have
and maybe discover ones

1207
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:23,020
that I didn't know I had.

1208
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:25,656
- You guys truly did
show up today for us,

1209
00:50:25,723 --> 00:50:27,925
and you continue
to put yourself out there,

1210
00:50:27,992 --> 00:50:30,561
and it really doesn't
go unnoticed.

1211
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:32,329
So cheers to you guys.

1212
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:33,764
Cheers.

1213
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:36,433
- I'm super excited
about tonight.

1214
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,936
Gabby and I discussed this week
that we would really like

1215
00:50:39,003 --> 00:50:41,505
to start forming
some really strong connections.

1216
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:42,673
Look at that.

1217
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,208
Look where we get to talk.

1218
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:47,645
- And today I was very
impressed by a couple of them,

1219
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:51,015
and I'm excited to see how
they take that into tonight.

1220
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,250
- Yeah, today was fun.
I, um...

1221
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:56,420
I feel like today, like... like,
I saw a different side of,

1222
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:59,557
like, how we can be, like,
be funny and be silly.

1223
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:02,026
- I know, and I, like,
need that.

1224
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:04,094
- Yes. Like, I saw
the romance part in this.

1225
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,263
Like, that is, like,
without a doubt,

1226
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,065
but today I was like,
wow, I can, like,

1227
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:10,401
really see you, like,
as a best friend too,

1228
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,269
and, like, that's,
like, so important to me,

1229
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:13,270
to have both,
you know what I mean?

1230
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:15,573
- Me too.
- So I'm happy that...

1231
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:18,609
We got to do that.

1232
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:22,313
This is so, like,
high school movie.

1233
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:25,115
Like, we're on a football
field right now.

1234
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,184
I feel like, like,
the star quarterback.

1235
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,091
- Do you want to teach me
how to play football?

1236
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,521
- Okay, we can... yeah.

1237
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:31,989
I'll teach you
whatever you want.

1238
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:35,993
Where am I going?

1239
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,494
- Let's see how far I can throw.

1240
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:38,662
Ready?
- Yeah.

1241
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:41,765
Oh, my.

1242
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:42,952
Good toss.
- I'm pretty good.

1243
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,177
- I'll hike it to you.
- All right.

1244
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,312
- Hopefully my pants don't rip,

1245
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:46,496
'cause they're kind of tight.

1246
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:48,806
- Good?
- Yeah.

1247
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,074
- Blue 42?
- Yeah.

1248
00:51:52,343 --> 00:51:53,844
- Oh, you're running?

1249
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:58,248
- My time with Aven,
running around SoFi Stadium,

1250
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:00,651
it really feels
like a crazy experience,

1251
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:02,753
and I just feel like
our connection gets

1252
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,820
better and better.

1253
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:09,793
And to lay down in the endzone
with him, making out,

1254
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,029
it's just a...
It's really amazing,

1255
00:52:12,096 --> 00:52:14,264
and I'm ha... I'm having
such a great time.

1256
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:16,467
- I kind of missed you.

1257
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,602
Oh, my goodness.

1258
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:19,746
- I don't know if it was that...

1259
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,147
I mean, I kind of
told you last week.

1260
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,107
- Mm-hmm.
- I was like, I'm here for you.

1261
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,142
So there's something
I've been wanting to do.

1262
00:52:25,209 --> 00:52:26,386
Sometimes you got
to create a moment, right?

1263
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:27,544
- Yeah.
- So...

1264
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:33,917
- So far there are guys
stepping up tonight,

1265
00:52:34,018 --> 00:52:38,422
and I am so blown out of the
water by some of these guys.

1266
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,658
- I have a secret.
- Okay, I wanna hear.

1267
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:43,327
- I'm a hundred percent certain

1268
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:45,162
I'm only pursuing you.

1269
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:58,776
- Tonight is, like,
out of a story book.

1270
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:03,647
I feel so lucky to have
the connections that I do.

1271
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:10,654
I haven't seen her in a while,
but I hope Gabby's doing well.

1272
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:12,656
I know she was really excited
for tonight,

1273
00:53:12,723 --> 00:53:15,793
and I'm hoping she's making
as many connections

1274
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,728
with some of these guys
and really starting

1275
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:20,798
to feel really strong feelings.

1276
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:22,966
- So how are you doing?

1277
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,435
- I'm good.
How are you?

1278
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:25,936
- I'm really good.
- Mm-hmm.

1279
00:53:26,003 --> 00:53:29,173
- Um, I kind of, like, wanted
to talk to you about today.

1280
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,641
It was obviously
an odd situation

1281
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,309
because Rachel was there
and everything.

1282
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:35,045
- Yeah.
- And, uh, you know, I...

1283
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:38,582
I just felt, like, a really
good connection with Rachel.

1284
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:41,385
Like, amazing one,
and, you know,

1285
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:43,120
I... I really do want
to pursue that.

1286
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:44,597
- Yes.
- And I want to be straight up

1287
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:46,032
with you, and I wanted
to tell you that...

1288
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,201
- I really appreciate it.
- 'Cause I respect you so much.

1289
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,369
- Yeah. No.
- And you're on your journey

1290
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:50,503
and everything.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1291
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:52,329
For sure.
You should tell Rachel.

1292
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:53,673
- Yeah, no, absolutely...
- Did you already? Yeah.

1293
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,041
- I... I didn't get a chance
to talk to her yet.

1294
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,233
- Yeah.
- But I really wanted

1295
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,235
to tell you first.
- No, thank you.

1296
00:53:58,302 --> 00:53:59,870
Naturally,
there are gonna be men

1297
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:02,139
that gravitate more
towards Rachel.

1298
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:03,474
Tyler is really sweet.

1299
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,743
He comes from such
a genuine place,

1300
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:07,611
and he's very respectful,

1301
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:09,580
and I truly just think
he's being honest,

1302
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:11,048
and I appreciate it.

1303
00:54:11,115 --> 00:54:13,016
How are you?
- I'm good.

1304
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,686
Honestly, today was a blast.
- Mm.

1305
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,254
- You know, I-it's funny,

1306
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:18,956
'cause obviously,
I'm not a model.

1307
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,290
Right, I'm not...

1308
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:21,901
- I don't do funny.
- You have a great bod.

1309
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,061
- I appreciate you.
I really do.

1310
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:25,939
You know, and obviously
I wanted this time to, like,

1311
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:27,631
talk to you and kind of...

1312
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:29,900
Kind of, like, give you
a little bit more insight

1313
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:31,602
on my intentions
and things like that.

1314
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:32,770
- Yeah. Yeah.

1315
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,114
- Today gave me
a lot of clarity.

1316
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:35,205
- Mm-hmm. Oh, good.
- Okay,

1317
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:38,742
and, you know,
I... I looked at that today

1318
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:40,677
and my own life and, like,

1319
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:43,113
what my values line up with,

1320
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:46,884
and, you know,
I do have my intentions

1321
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,519
fully for Rachel.

1322
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,054
- Yeah.
- And I think you have

1323
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,858
the bubbly aspect to you,
the... the goofy aspect,

1324
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:56,794
and you're a little bit
more, like...

1325
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,238
I don't want to say
rough around the edges,

1326
00:54:58,262 --> 00:55:01,932
but y'all want people
to be very direct with y'all,

1327
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:03,801
and so obviously
I wanted to make sure

1328
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,669
that I expressed that to you.

1329
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:07,371
- Yeah, totally.

1330
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:09,606
- You're the best.
- Oh, you are.

1331
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:12,176
Lo and behold, I've been
freaking out all week

1332
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:15,379
that I'm not good enough
to be the Bachelorette.

1333
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:16,680
- Appreciate you.

1334
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:18,515
You do look great tonight.
- Thank you.

1335
00:55:18,582 --> 00:55:20,350
And then Hayden tells me

1336
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:24,054
he feels his morals
more align with Rachel,

1337
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:27,558
and being called
"rough around the edges,"

1338
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:28,926
like, definitely hurts.

1339
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,928
That's my fear.

1340
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,931
- Um, I really wanted
to talk to you because,

1341
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,176
like, I think we can, like,
joke around and just be, like,

1342
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,969
funny and... and just
cause a ton of laughter,

1343
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:41,872
but I don't know if maybe
we've had the connection

1344
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:44,041
that I think I wanted to have...

1345
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:45,267
- Yeah.
- With you from the...

1346
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:46,577
From the get-go.
- Mm-hmm.

1347
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:47,963
- Like, I think, like, even if...

1348
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,980
Like, say if you were
the only person here,

1349
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:52,716
I don't think I could have
the heart to continue,

1350
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:54,627
because at the end of the day,
we're trying to find somebody

1351
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:55,986
for the rest of our lives.

1352
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:57,197
- Yeah, absolutely.
- You know what I'm saying?

1353
00:55:57,221 --> 00:55:58,722
- Mm-hmm.
- But obviously, like,

1354
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:59,790
you're smokin'.

1355
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,158
Yeah.

1356
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:02,793
Well, shoot.
I... I'm happy that...

1357
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,794
- Yeah.
- I'm happy we got

1358
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,138
to have this talk though.
- Me too.

1359
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:06,263
Yeah
- Bye, Gabby.

1360
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,364
- Okay.
- All right.

1361
00:56:07,431 --> 00:56:08,899
Well, hey, cheers?
- Yes, of course.

1362
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:10,801
- To finding our future person.
- Of course.

1363
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,236
Yeah.
- All right. Cool.

1364
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:15,915
Let's get back in there
and have some fun.

1365
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,040
Yeah.

1366
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:26,516
- I think these guys
coming to me saying that,

1367
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:30,554
because I'm different, they
don't want to be with me is...

1368
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:36,660
Like, validating that
I'm maybe too much for people.

1369
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:37,837
- Is this where we're sitting?

1370
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:39,172
Do you know?
- Yeah, is that... yeah.

1371
00:56:39,196 --> 00:56:43,233
- Ultimately, like,
yeah, it hurts to hear,

1372
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,469
but, like,
I'm sure Rachel is going

1373
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:47,304
through something similar.

1374
00:56:47,371 --> 00:56:49,907
- I'm here for you, and, like...
- Thank you.

1375
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,708
- I think you're beautiful
and...

1376
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:53,744
- I do feel like
we have a connection.

1377
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:57,614
- That makes me feel amazing.
I'm so glad you said that.

1378
00:57:00,284 --> 00:57:02,419
- You know, I'm...
I'm so different

1379
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:04,388
than another Bachelorette,

1380
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:08,592
so my biggest fear was being
too rough around the edges,

1381
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:10,661
and now I am that for people.

1382
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,529
- I think Gabby's amazing,

1383
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,731
but you're definitely
more my type.

1384
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:15,999
- Well...

1385
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,237
- Like,
when it comes down to it,

1386
00:57:20,304 --> 00:57:22,673
like, I want to be
rough around the edges.

1387
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,275
'cause I know who I am
on the inside,

1388
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:28,145
and I'm proud of it.

1389
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,889
- Hello.
- Whoa.

1390
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,924
Hello.
- Hi, guys.

1391
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:43,460
Tonight was really, really good.

1392
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:48,398
A lot of guys have let me know
where they stand tonight,

1393
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,167
which is a really good feeling.

1394
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:53,136
And I'm so excited
to hand out a rose.

1395
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:54,905
- Yo, where's
your partner in crime?

1396
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,107
- I don't know.
Where is she?

1397
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:58,508
You guys do something?

1398
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,043
- Oh, there she comes.

1399
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:08,418
- This is a very
dramatic entrance.

1400
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,620
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1401
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:11,722
- How are you?
- Hi. Good.

1402
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:13,390
How are you?
- Good.

1403
00:58:14,558 --> 00:58:17,995
Well, thank you guys
for such an incredible day

1404
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,430
and an even better night.

1405
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:24,701
I had so many amazing
conversations tonight,

1406
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:28,305
but unfortunately,
this can only go to one person.

1407
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:33,744
This person continues to make
me feel really seen and safe.

1408
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:39,449
Aven, will you accept this rose?

1409
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,551
- Of course I will.

1410
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:42,618
- Whoa.

1411
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:55,399
- Today, the photo shoot
with Gabby was magical

1412
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:58,935
and kind of reaffirmed
my feelings and emotions.

1413
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:01,038
I already know
I see a future with her.

1414
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,807
So I definitely have my eye
on the Group Date Rose.

1415
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:11,415
- Um, I think you guys are
getting a feel of who I am,

1416
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:15,218
and I... I think I've
been open with some of you

1417
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:18,855
about how I've had, um,
kind of a difficult week

1418
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:21,992
coming into myself in this role,

1419
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:27,464
and tonight has kind of
been hard for me in ways.

1420
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:32,202
So I feel like I can't
give a rose tonight.

1421
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:43,013
So I think we can say goodbye.

1422
00:59:50,854 --> 00:59:52,722
Hi.
- What's wrong?

1423
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:56,560
- A couple guys just had
some choice words

1424
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,428
that didn't sit right
with me tonight.

1425
00:59:58,495 --> 01:00:00,864
- What do you mean?
- Like, Hayden told me

1426
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,799
that I was rough
around the edges.

1427
01:00:02,866 --> 01:00:04,101
What the?

1428
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,769
- And Jacob straight up told me

1429
01:00:05,836 --> 01:00:08,605
that if I was here by myself,
then he would leave.

1430
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:12,242
- What the?
- Are you kidding me?

1431
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:13,376
- No.

1432
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,645
And, like, I was hurt.

1433
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:17,280
- So, like,
did you talk to Jason?

1434
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,082
- No. I just had a breakdown.

1435
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:20,083
- Oh, my God.

1436
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,885
Gabby, come here.

1437
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:24,864
- Yeah, I feel good,
but obviously that was tough

1438
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:28,792
to see Gabby not hand out
a rose to anyone here, so...

1439
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:29,993
- For sure.

1440
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,804
- Did, uh... did, uh, you talk
to both tonight?

1441
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:32,929
- Uh, I did.

1442
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:34,531
- Wow.
- I did. I did.

1443
01:00:34,598 --> 01:00:36,609
- Hayden, could you please
explain your conversation?

1444
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,677
Like, I want to know
what the hell happened.

1445
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:40,704
- Yeah, I just told Gabby
that, um,

1446
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:44,608
respectfully, my intentions
were to pursue Rachel.

1447
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:46,843
- What did she say?
- She respected that,

1448
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:50,547
so in... in my eyes, this
was a positive step forward.

1449
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,451
- Honestly, you can't...

1450
01:00:54,518 --> 01:00:56,386
What do they think,
insulting one of us is...

1451
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:57,730
Is gonna make
the other li... like...

1452
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,422
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, because there's

1453
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,424
two of us, they think
they can act that way?

1454
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,026
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna address it?

1455
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:04,027
- No.
- Like, do you want me

1456
01:01:04,094 --> 01:01:05,595
to address it?
- No.

1457
01:01:06,897 --> 01:01:08,765
- Okay.
Whatever you need.

1458
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:09,976
- Yeah.
- And we'll talk tomorrow.

1459
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,110
- I love you.
- All right, I love you.

1460
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:13,703
- I'm here to find
a lifelong partner.

1461
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:17,174
I'm not here to teach dudes
how to act.

1462
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,608
- I'm gonna kill 'em.

1463
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:22,279
- I know that they know
that something's up.

1464
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,315
I think that they'll have time
to reflect on their

1465
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:27,551
and figure out what happened.

1466
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:30,554
But for me, I kind of don't
know how to proceed

1467
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:34,558
or if it's gonna be okay,
so something has to change.

1468
01:01:44,134 --> 01:01:45,344
- How are you feeling
after everything?

1469
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,571
- You know, the big thing
that happened last night

1470
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:49,372
that kind of shook me
a little bit,

1471
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,074
and I'm sure
would have shook you,

1472
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:52,709
was how the night ended
with Gabby.

1473
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:56,513
As I was walking out,
I actually passed Gabby,

1474
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:59,449
and she... it looked
like she was crying to me.

1475
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:01,594
- Bro, her not giving
a rose out,

1476
01:02:01,618 --> 01:02:02,886
like, that was tough to watch.

1477
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:04,263
She's clearly feeling
some type of way

1478
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,722
or upset about something, so...

1479
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:07,490
- Jacob's like,
"Yeah, me and Gabby

1480
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,959
ended our relationship."

1481
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,236
- Jumped ship, yeah.
- And then Hayden was like,

1482
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,761
"Well, yeah, I talked to Gabby,

1483
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,105
and told her
that I'm going for Rachel."

1484
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:14,173
- You know, that could, like,

1485
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:15,599
mentally
mess with you a little bit.

1486
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:17,767
- It's just upsetting
to see someone who seems

1487
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:21,404
so comfortable and strong
to be in a place like that.

1488
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,015
- To go into that night
thinking that, you know,

1489
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,075
I've got another rose,
there's another potential...

1490
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:26,319
- Yeah.
- To find someone you want

1491
01:02:26,343 --> 01:02:28,078
to spend time with
and leave that upset,

1492
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:29,946
is... like, that's horrible, so...

1493
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:31,881
- Yeah, and it probably is...

1494
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:33,049
Goes a lot deeper than...

1495
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:34,251
Than we even know.
- Yeah.

1496
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,823
- Last night,
when Hayden came up to me,

1497
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:41,758
and when I heard, you know,

1498
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:44,060
"You're rough around the edges,

1499
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:46,696
and I... I want to be
with someone different,"

1500
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,232
it just, like,
struck the deepest chord,

1501
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:54,004
and I literally didn't know
if I could continue doing this.

1502
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,873
- Yeah.
I am so sorry

1503
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,309
that you even had
to feel that way last night.

1504
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:01,077
I'm so proud of you
for even coming out

1505
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:03,179
and just saying you weren't
gonna give the rose.

1506
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:05,348
- I think what happened
last night,

1507
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:07,017
you know, with Hayden and Jacob,

1508
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:10,353
is that they like the feeling
of being able to,

1509
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,955
in a sense, reject one of us.

1510
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:13,890
- Mm-hmm.
- And it is a way

1511
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:17,494
of self-preservation, um,
for them to be like,

1512
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,262
"I... I have another option."

1513
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:21,431
- Frankly, it doesn't matter
at this point

1514
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:22,565
really what they think...

1515
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,067
- Yeah.
- Because it is our journey.

1516
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:26,169
- Yeah.
- Of course no one has

1517
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:27,780
put me in the position
that you were in,

1518
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,639
and I can't even compare it,

1519
01:03:29,706 --> 01:03:33,576
but I definitely agree
that we wanted to feel chosen,

1520
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,078
and we wanted
to kind of let them...

1521
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:36,379
- Mm-hmm.
- Lean either way,

1522
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:37,881
but it turned
into something ugly.

1523
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:39,416
It is just so messy.

1524
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,584
- Yeah.
- And we can't move forward.

1525
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,387
If we don't make a change
right now,

1526
01:03:44,454 --> 01:03:46,923
I think it could really end
in a disaster.

1527
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,925
- Yeah.

1528
01:03:55,365 --> 01:03:57,485
- Last night gave me a lot of
clarity with everything,

1529
01:03:57,534 --> 01:03:59,903
as far as, um,
who I'm pursuing...

1530
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:01,338
Obviously, which is Rachel,

1531
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,282
but obviously tonight's
a big night for everyone.

1532
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:04,774
There's a Rose Ceremony.
- Right.

1533
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,210
- And, uh,
my head's in a good spot.

1534
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:10,046
- Yeah, for me personally,
I'm just a little disappointed

1535
01:04:10,113 --> 01:04:12,349
that I wasn't able to get time,
and so, you know,

1536
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:13,759
I'm looking forward
to kind of getting time

1537
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:15,151
with both of them tonight.

1538
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:16,986
Tonight's a big night.
It's huge.

1539
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:19,389
And for my personally,
I'm looking just for,

1540
01:04:19,456 --> 01:04:22,192
you know, more one-on-one time
with Gabby and Rachel.

1541
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:24,994
You know, I still haven't
decided which one I want to,

1542
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:27,197
you know, spend all my time
and energy with,

1543
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:29,699
but, you know, hopefully
I can get some clarity tonight.

1544
01:04:29,766 --> 01:04:31,935
- Tonight is absolutely
going to be monumental,

1545
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:36,639
in that I think they're looking
to kind of set in stone

1546
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,742
who they want
to pursue relations with.

1547
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:41,845
I just hope that Gabby
and Rachel get that clarity

1548
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:44,214
and can move forward with this
without having to worry

1549
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,150
about who's there for them,
who's not there for them.

1550
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,451
That's just where I am.

1551
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:50,420
- I mean, we all know
roses are on the line,

1552
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:52,622
so I think this is
your last chance, you know,

1553
01:04:52,689 --> 01:04:54,700
obviously to make an impression
on one of these women.

1554
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,493
I'm really pumped up,
to be honest,

1555
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,661
and I can't wait
to get this going.

1556
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:06,703
- Gentlemen, how we doing?

1557
01:05:07,871 --> 01:05:09,539
Everybody doing okay?

1558
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:14,244
Um, I know I am not
who you were expecting to see,

1559
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,112
but I do have some news for you.

1560
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:18,257
I know you all were really
excited to see Gabby and Rachel

1561
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:21,584
tonight at the cocktail party...

1562
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:23,219
but that's not gonna happen...

1563
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:28,258
Because the cocktail party
is officially canceled.

1564
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,562
So you all will be moving

1565
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:34,831
directly
on to the Rose Ceremony.

1566
01:05:34,898 --> 01:05:38,134
- Now what?
- Are you kidding me?

1567
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:41,037
- That really isn't the only
thing I want to tell you all.

1568
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:42,772
Rachel and Gabby have realized

1569
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:46,676
that this whole thing
is just not working for them,

1570
01:05:46,743 --> 01:05:51,314
and to be honest, if this thing
continues to go down this path,

1571
01:05:51,381 --> 01:05:53,716
they're not gonna find love.

1572
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:57,153
So at the end of the day,
that journey...

1573
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,421
is over.

1574
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:06,396
But that doesn't mean they're
just willing to give up.

1575
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,931
This is how it's gonna work,

1576
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:09,299
Gabby and Rachel have decided

1577
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:11,301
that the best way
moving forward is to continue

1578
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:13,336
on their journeys separately.

1579
01:06:13,403 --> 01:06:14,938
If you accept a rose tonight,

1580
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,440
that means you are committing
to dating one woman,

1581
01:06:17,507 --> 01:06:20,577
that woman that offers you
the rose that you accept,

1582
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,612
and not the other.

1583
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:24,581
There will be one group
of men for Gabby,

1584
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:26,749
and there will be another group
that is pursuing

1585
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,718
and committed to Rachel.

1586
01:06:28,785 --> 01:06:31,721
Fellas, look,
this really could be

1587
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:34,657
the biggest decision
of your lives.

1588
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:36,326
I'll see all of you
at the Rose Ceremony.

1589
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:37,861
Good luck.

1590
01:06:48,271 --> 01:06:50,039
- Well, that was a big shock.

1591
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:51,307
Holy.

1592
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:52,775
- Cocktail party is canceled.

1593
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,878
I did not see this coming.

1594
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:57,247
This was time that I needed

1595
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:59,616
so I can speak
to both Gabby and Rachel

1596
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:03,052
and kind of get, you know,
that clarity from them as well.

1597
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,922
So I don't know what to think.

1598
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:08,067
- It just goes to show you,
you should act on something

1599
01:07:08,091 --> 01:07:09,459
when you feel it.

1600
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,628
I'm gonna follow my heart
the best I can, and, uh,

1601
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,930
if I'm lucky enough
to receive a rose,

1602
01:07:13,997 --> 01:07:16,900
I'll act according
to what my conscience tells me.

1603
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:19,769
- I think the guys tonight
that are on the fence,

1604
01:07:19,836 --> 01:07:21,771
the... the pressure's
gonna be put on them.

1605
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:23,382
Obviously, these guys
are really gonna have to

1606
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:25,408
figure out, you know,
who they want to pursue.

1607
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:27,877
- At this point,
I've committed to Rachel.

1608
01:07:27,944 --> 01:07:30,179
Hopefully Rachel feels
the same way I do.

1609
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:32,148
- We do owe it to the ladies
and to ourselves

1610
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:34,617
to kind of make that decision.

1611
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:37,096
You know, if this helps prevent
another night like last night,

1612
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,955
like, you know, I'm all for it.

1613
01:07:39,022 --> 01:07:40,957
- They have their mind made up.

1614
01:07:41,024 --> 01:07:43,993
So if you haven't done
what you needed to,

1615
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,261
you're gonna go home.

1616
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:46,763
- Guys are losing their marbles,

1617
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,798
and we're gonna see
how this night's about to go,

1618
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:51,534
but I can tell you right now,
this will be

1619
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:54,871
the craziest night
in Bachelor Nation history.

1620
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,097
- Tonight is a Rose Ceremony,

1621
01:08:21,164 --> 01:08:23,933
and Rachel and I decided
that we are giving out

1622
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,669
our own roses
to the individual men

1623
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:30,506
who will agree to come
on our journey separately.

1624
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:33,843
We overcame so much

1625
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:36,946
on our previous journey with
Clayton in our last experience,

1626
01:08:37,013 --> 01:08:41,217
but I think we have
to kind of be brave enough

1627
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:43,820
and separate at some point,

1628
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:47,056
and this Rose Ceremony
is the beginning of that.

1629
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,334
- You weren't there last night.

1630
01:08:48,358 --> 01:08:49,292
I'm... all right,
so this what happened.

1631
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:50,493
- Tell me the vibes, bro.

1632
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,362
- Yo, it was so bad.

1633
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:54,497
Like, she's probably
so upset right now.

1634
01:08:54,564 --> 01:08:58,468
Myself and Zach are in
the winner's circle for Rachel,

1635
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:01,404
and Erich's in the winner's
circle for Gabby,

1636
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,115
so we're kind of just
sitting around waiting

1637
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,074
to see who comes out
for each side

1638
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,509
and kind of take it from there.

1639
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:08,978
This is probably gonna be
a pretty stressful, uh...

1640
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:10,046
Stressful Rose Ceremony.

1641
01:09:10,113 --> 01:09:12,015
- This is what I'm worried
about is,

1642
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:13,650
people will be, like, you know,

1643
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,918
"If I get a rose from
this person, I'll say yes."

1644
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,587
When the time comes to it,

1645
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,632
when you're standing up
in front of that, you know,

1646
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:22,492
woman that maybe you didn't
exactly expect,

1647
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:23,760
will they stick to their word?

1648
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,128
I don't know. That's tough.

1649
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:27,163
- I know.
- And I hope they do,

1650
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:28,790
because you're playing
with their heart.

1651
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,876
- Gentlemen, welcome
to your second Rose Ceremony.

1652
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:42,078
I know it's not
what you expected.

1653
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:43,288
I'm sure by now you've noticed,

1654
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:45,915
there are two pedestals
with roses.

1655
01:09:45,982 --> 01:09:49,352
Rachel and Gabby have each
individually decided

1656
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:51,354
which men they want
to continue dating.

1657
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:55,425
I really hope that each of you
has given strong consideration

1658
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:57,860
with respect
to where your feelings lie.

1659
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:00,229
Do you see a future with Gabby?

1660
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:01,364
Or is it with Rachel?

1661
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:04,400
I wish you all luck.

1662
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:16,979
- I am excited to finally
go on my own journey

1663
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,748
and for Gabby to go on hers.

1664
01:10:18,815 --> 01:10:21,384
I feel confident in the group
of guys that I want to pursue,

1665
01:10:21,451 --> 01:10:24,687
but I'm really nervous
for Gabby,

1666
01:10:24,754 --> 01:10:26,923
because I definitely didn't see

1667
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:28,691
what happened
last night happening.

1668
01:10:28,758 --> 01:10:32,628
I know that I would be
so shocked

1669
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:35,231
and so hurt
if that happened to me,

1670
01:10:35,298 --> 01:10:38,000
and if someone were
to reject her rose tonight,

1671
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,636
this could end in disaster.

1672
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:43,740
- Thank you guys all
for being here.

1673
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:46,209
I know it's been a crazy week.

1674
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:49,412
I think having
two Bachelorettes has

1675
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:54,050
provided struggle
that nobody could prepare for.

1676
01:10:54,117 --> 01:10:57,987
Personally for me,
some conversations last night

1677
01:10:58,054 --> 01:11:01,390
were hurtful
and the impetus that we needed

1678
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:05,027
to move forward
in our two separate journeys.

1679
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:08,097
- So with that, we can begin.

1680
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:20,076
Tino.

1681
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,652
Tino, will you accept this rose?

1682
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:30,953
- Absolutely.

1683
01:11:40,196 --> 01:11:42,131
I knew it.

1684
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:43,966
- Hey, shh, shh.
Hey, calm down.

1685
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:57,647
- Nate.

1686
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,255
Nate, will you accept this rose?

1687
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:10,226
- Absolutely.

1688
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:21,771
What's up, E-Money?

1689
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:22,772
- Nate.
It's Nate.

1690
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,173
- Nate.
- It's Nate.

1691
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,475
- I'm excited
to get a rose from Gabby.

1692
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:28,644
I feel good with our connection
right now,

1693
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:31,647
but, um, I hope Rachel gets to,

1694
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:33,549
you know, choose the people
for her as well.

1695
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:40,423
- Logan.

1696
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,697
Logan, will you accept
this rose?

1697
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:49,198
- Yes.

1698
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:57,940
- Welcome to the club.

1699
01:12:58,007 --> 01:13:01,677
- I'm curious to see
if anyone says, like, no.

1700
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:02,845
- Yeah.

1701
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:14,590
- Johnny.

1702
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:22,965
Johnny, will you accept
this rose?

1703
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:27,536
- Of course I will.

1704
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:33,709
- So far tonight has been
going really well.

1705
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:35,912
I think this is a great thing

1706
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:39,548
that Gabby and I are getting
our actual own love stories.

1707
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:41,517
- Oh, here comes somebody.
- Johnny, for sure.

1708
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:44,787
- Good.
This is... this makes sense.

1709
01:13:44,854 --> 01:13:48,557
- This journey, it's...
It's not the beginning anymore,

1710
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:50,726
and I really hope we can start
getting to that point

1711
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:55,331
and really getting more clarity
on who our husband is.

1712
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,500
Termayne.

1713
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:06,342
Termayne, will you accept
this rose?

1714
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,546
- Look, I don't want
to be the guy

1715
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:13,783
to first decline the rose
of the night,

1716
01:14:13,849 --> 01:14:17,653
but I am gonna have to decline
the rose.

1717
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,097
I feel like we could
be great friends

1718
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,489
outside of this, obviously,

1719
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:23,592
but I feel like I have
a deeper connection with Gabby.

1720
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:43,446
- I am gonna have to decline
the rose.

1721
01:14:51,354 --> 01:14:53,723
- Gentlemen, ladies,

1722
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,758
all right,
just want to clarify here,

1723
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,527
'cause obviously
this is all new,

1724
01:14:58,594 --> 01:15:00,563
you declined Rachel's rose.

1725
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:01,764
- Yes.
- All right.

1726
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:02,975
Because you're holding out
for Gabby?

1727
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:04,100
- Mm-hmm.

1728
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,344
- All right,
I think what we need to do

1729
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:06,969
is put Termayne back in line

1730
01:15:07,036 --> 01:15:09,805
and then find out if Gabby's
gonna offer you a rose.

1731
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,073
- Okay.

1732
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,846
- It looked like Termayne
got up and then came back.

1733
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:18,481
Yeah?

1734
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:20,182
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1735
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:22,685
Did he turn down a rose?

1736
01:15:22,752 --> 01:15:23,752
- Oh.
- People might have

1737
01:15:23,786 --> 01:15:25,021
turned down a rose..

1738
01:15:25,087 --> 01:15:26,589
- Now Rachel, I'm so sorry,

1739
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:29,025
but because Termayne rejected
your rose,

1740
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:31,494
you can no longer offer
that rose tonight.

1741
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:39,602
Now, Termayne, you've made
your intentions very clear.

1742
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:41,003
You wish to pursue Gabby.

1743
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:43,205
But Termayne,
if you do not receive a rose,

1744
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,741
you will be leaving us tonight.

1745
01:15:45,808 --> 01:15:47,143
Thank you all.

1746
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:56,052
- Termayne rejecting my rose
was so embarrassing

1747
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:58,454
because it was
in front of everyone.

1748
01:15:58,521 --> 01:16:01,824
It was not only embarrassing,
but just really surprising

1749
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,993
because I didn't think
him and Gabby

1750
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,395
had that strong of a connection.

1751
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:14,136
- Spencer.

1752
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,010
Spencer, will you accept
this rose?

1753
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:22,545
- Yes, ma'am.

1754
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:26,582
- Getting rejected,
it's humiliating.

1755
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:29,919
But I feel like I owe it
to myself to prove to myself

1756
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:32,321
I can be strong enough
to hold it together

1757
01:16:32,388 --> 01:16:33,789
for the rest
of the Rose Ceremony.

1758
01:16:40,496 --> 01:16:41,630
Alec.

1759
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:47,803
Alec, will you accept this rose?

1760
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,842
- Um...

1761
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:55,511
unfortunately,
I don't think I can.

1762
01:16:55,578 --> 01:16:59,248
Uh, I just don't think
I'm the right one for you.

1763
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:00,983
- That's okay. Thank you.

1764
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,551
- Thank you, Rachel.

1765
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:03,853
Pleasure to meet you.

1766
01:17:09,225 --> 01:17:10,960
- No one else has came out here.

1767
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:12,986
- Are you catching that...
- Jesse just walked in.

1768
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:16,432
Jesse just walked in.
- Are you hearing that?

1769
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,734
- Rachel, I'm sorry again,

1770
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:20,202
but I do have to take your rose.

1771
01:17:25,174 --> 01:17:26,942
- What?

1772
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:28,911
This is weird.

1773
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,513
- I think, you know,
looking around,

1774
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:32,548
everyone just kind of had
this feeling of, like,

1775
01:17:32,615 --> 01:17:33,855
oh, my gosh, what is happening?

1776
01:17:33,916 --> 01:17:36,185
Like, you know,
just because it's awkward.

1777
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:42,925
- Jason.

1778
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:49,064
Jason, will you accept
this rose?

1779
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:51,267
- I would love
to accept this rose.

1780
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,269
Get closer.

1781
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:54,703
Thank you.

1782
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:10,252
- Tyler.

1783
01:18:14,657 --> 01:18:16,926
Tyler, will you accept
this rose?

1784
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:18,527
- Absolutely.

1785
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:22,831
- When I first found out
I was the Bachelorette,

1786
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:25,067
the first thing
my parents said to me was,

1787
01:18:25,134 --> 01:18:27,303
"Can you handle this
emotionally?"

1788
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:28,938
- Mario.

1789
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:32,908
- When they said that,
I was like, I'm so strong.

1790
01:18:32,975 --> 01:18:34,343
I can do this, of course,

1791
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:37,112
but what if I'm really not
strong enough to do it?

1792
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:39,648
Like, maybe they were right,
maybe I can't do this.

1793
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:40,955
Maybe I shouldn't have done it.

1794
01:18:40,983 --> 01:18:43,319
Ethan, will you accept
this rose?

1795
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:44,486
- Absolutely.

1796
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,355
- I feel terrible for Rachel

1797
01:18:46,422 --> 01:18:50,025
because I know what it's like
getting rejected by these men.

1798
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:51,236
Kirk, will you accept
this rose...

1799
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,595
- Yes, absolutely.

1800
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:55,364
- Last night, I did allow
some of these men

1801
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:57,967
to make me feel terrible
about myself.

1802
01:19:00,002 --> 01:19:01,971
- Jordan, will you accept
this rose?

1803
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:03,806
- Always.

1804
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:05,541
- I know what it's like
to wonder,

1805
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:07,409
what's wrong with me?

1806
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:10,546
Can I actually do this?
What if it happens again?

1807
01:19:10,613 --> 01:19:13,148
Quincey, will you accept
this rose?

1808
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:14,783
- Of course.

1809
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,785
- I think that has to be
what's going on

1810
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:18,187
in Rachel's mind right now.

1811
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:22,124
- Meatball.

1812
01:19:26,829 --> 01:19:29,565
Meatball, will you accept
this rose?

1813
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:34,169
- I'm sorry, um, I cannot.

1814
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:35,771
I'm here for Gabby.

1815
01:19:35,838 --> 01:19:37,840
Um, I just have to go
with my heart.

1816
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:39,150
- Okay. I appreciate it.
- I'm sorry.

1817
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:40,776
- No, thank you.

1818
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:49,551
- Did somebody else say no?

1819
01:19:57,393 --> 01:19:58,670
- Meatball just rejected Rachel.

1820
01:19:58,694 --> 01:20:01,363
- All right, boys,
what is going on right now?

1821
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,499
- My brain is spinning
right now.

1822
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,641
- Dude, the girls
just walked out.

1823
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:13,909
The girls just walked out.

1824
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:18,847
Like, it's...

1825
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:24,353
- But that doesn't...

1826
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,629
I can't. Like...

1827
01:20:36,699 --> 01:20:39,601
To hear three people,
one after another,

1828
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:42,271
stop me and say,
"I can't accept this rose,"

1829
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:44,907
it was so humiliating.

1830
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:46,742
It was the hardest moment
I've had

1831
01:20:46,809 --> 01:20:48,977
as the Bachelorette, truly.

1832
01:20:50,746 --> 01:20:52,948
Yeah, it just is hard
because the whole time,

1833
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:55,651
I just thought, like, you know,
it didn't work out

1834
01:20:55,718 --> 01:20:59,154
with Clayton, and I didn't
ever expect to be Bachelorette.

1835
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:00,255
I didn't.

1836
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:08,330
- Rachel, Gabby,
it's the final rose tonight.

1837
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:10,666
When you're both ready.

1838
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:15,671
- And so it's just hard
to, like,

1839
01:21:15,738 --> 01:21:17,005
really feel like I deserve it,

1840
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:19,742
'cause I never feel like I did.

1841
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:22,444
And then to be rejected again
multiple times

1842
01:21:22,511 --> 01:21:24,680
after you already feel
like you don't deserve it,

1843
01:21:24,747 --> 01:21:27,116
is hard.

1844
01:21:39,695 --> 01:21:42,331
I feel so lucky to be here.

1845
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:44,142
Like, I'm lucky
to be standing next to Gabby,

1846
01:21:44,166 --> 01:21:45,968
and I still feel that way, I do,

1847
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:47,703
because she deserves it.

1848
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:49,238
- Michael.

1849
01:21:53,175 --> 01:21:55,310
Michael, will you accept
this rose?

1850
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:57,246
- Yes, I will.

1851
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,654
- To find love
is what I'm here for,

1852
01:22:05,721 --> 01:22:09,224
but if I get rejected
one more time,

1853
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,226
I am ready to walk out
and leave.

1854
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:13,996
I'm ready to be done,
go home to Florida.

1855
01:22:14,062 --> 01:22:16,031
I'm... why am I here?

1856
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:27,876
Hayden.

1857
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:41,156
Hayden, will you accept
this rose?

1858
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:45,027
- Absolutely.

1859
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:55,537
- Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

1860
01:22:55,604 --> 01:22:57,706
Please take a moment
and say your goodbyes.

1861
01:22:59,608 --> 01:23:01,143
- Thank you.

1862
01:23:02,778 --> 01:23:04,646
- Thank you so much, Termayne.

1863
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:06,682
I really respect you.

1864
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:09,084
Tonight was a little awkward
at times,

1865
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:10,819
a little rocky at times,

1866
01:23:10,886 --> 01:23:13,989
but I think for kind of the
first time in this journey,

1867
01:23:14,056 --> 01:23:16,758
I feel like I am in control.

1868
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,594
We made it...

1869
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:19,595
Barely.

1870
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,396
Walking in and seeing

1871
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:23,198
my nine guys waiting for me,

1872
01:23:23,265 --> 01:23:24,466
I just feel elated.

1873
01:23:24,533 --> 01:23:26,213
I feel like good things
can come out of it,

1874
01:23:26,268 --> 01:23:28,704
and just so excited
for what's to come.

1875
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:29,838
Here's to love.

1876
01:23:29,905 --> 01:23:31,640
To love.

1877
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:33,842
- To love.
- To love.

1878
01:23:33,909 --> 01:23:36,645
- Coming up next week
on "The Bachelorette"...

1879
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:38,347
Ohh!

1880
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:39,948
- Paris is romantic.

1881
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,450
There's something in the air.

1882
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:43,752
- Paris just does something
to you.

1883
01:23:43,819 --> 01:23:45,363
- There's gonna be two
separate groups now.

1884
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:46,627
We're on two separate journeys.

1885
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:50,626
- Love to you is just
the ultimate thing,

1886
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,427
and that's exactly how I am.

1887
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:55,731
- I never thought I would
be able to find someone,

1888
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:58,300
and, like, now it's right
in front of my face.

1889
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:01,803
- Every time I'm in the same
room as Gabby and Rachel,

1890
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,006
I realize my feelings
toward Gabby.

1891
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:05,974
- He made a vulgar comparison,

1892
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,710
something about,
"I don't trust these bitches."

1893
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:12,080
- I've tried hard
to put my feelings aside,

1894
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:13,515
but the heart wants
what it wants.

1895
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:16,318
- Every single day's
like a roller coaster.

1896
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:17,625
- Why does she look pissed off?

1897
01:24:17,653 --> 01:24:19,397
- Do you know why I'm talking
to you right now?

1898
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:20,656
- The shock on their faces,

1899
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,858
no one even knew
what I was coming from.

1900
01:24:22,925 --> 01:24:24,760
- Tonight, Rachel was given
some information

1901
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:27,696
about some things said
that was really disturbing.

1902
01:24:27,763 --> 01:24:30,032
- I hate every single day
having to get

1903
01:24:30,098 --> 01:24:31,800
to the point
of wanting to leave.

1904
01:24:31,867 --> 01:24:34,603
I'm just so over this.
I'm so done.

1905
01:24:42,144 --> 01:24:43,946
- When Rachel offered me a rose,

1906
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:46,315
I just think I...

1907
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:48,617
made a decision, you know,
in the moment,

1908
01:24:48,684 --> 01:24:51,653
and immediately when
I said it, I regretted it.

1909
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,021
I think I did make a mistake.

1910
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,790
Hey, Rachel?

1911
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:56,625
Could I talk to you
for a second?

1912
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,537
I just feel like there might
be something there.

1913
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:01,430
I just...

1914
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:03,074
you know, I spent more time
with Gabby...

1915
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,175
- Mm-hmm.
- So I think there was, like,

1916
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:06,602
an immediate kind of
connection there,

1917
01:25:06,668 --> 01:25:09,037
and we just didn't get
that one-on-one time.

1918
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:11,773
You know, I was trying to get
to talk to you, but...

1919
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,875
I feel like we just never got
that opportunity.

1920
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,611
- Yeah.
- But I... you know,

1921
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:17,746
I... I really wanna, you know,
get to know you.

1922
01:25:17,813 --> 01:25:20,682
- Yeah.
- I think there are feelings

1923
01:25:20,749 --> 01:25:21,883
that I have for you.
- Yeah.

1924
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,086
- I don't know how you feel
about me.

1925
01:25:24,152 --> 01:25:25,387
- I gave you the rose.

1926
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:26,688
I know.

1927
01:25:26,755 --> 01:25:28,790
We haven't really had
that much time to talk.

1928
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:30,025
- Mm-hmm.
- Um,

1929
01:25:30,092 --> 01:25:31,492
I think you're
incredibly beautiful.

1930
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:32,971
- Thank you.
- I love your personality.

1931
01:25:32,995 --> 01:25:34,896
- Thank you.
- And I'd love to just kind of

1932
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:35,897
give it another shot.

1933
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,299
What... what do you think?

1934
01:25:37,323 --> 01:25:39,323
