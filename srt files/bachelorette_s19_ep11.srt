1
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,571
TONIGHT...

2
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,110
THE SHOCKING
DRAMA BEGINS...

3
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:11,311
LIVE.

4
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,645
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS

5
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:13,547
ANYMORE.

6
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:13,814
GABBY.

7
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:15,681
I WANT TO LEAVE HERE.

8
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,383
GET READY FOR THE DRAMATIC

9
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,519
SEASON FINALE OF

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,187
"THE BACHELORETTE."

11
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:21,387
FOUR MEN.

12
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,256
I WANT TO BE WITH RACHEL AT

13
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,190
THE END OF THIS.

14
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:23,824
LIKE, I WANT TO
HAVE A LIFE WITH

15
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:24,658
HER.

16
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:26,225
TWO WOMEN.

17
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,660
WE ARE LITERALLY
ABOUT TO BE

18
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,662
ENGAGED.

19
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:30,430
I FEEL LIKE ALL MY DREAMS

20
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,164
ARE, LIKE, COMING TRUE.

21
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,734
AND ONE DRAMATIC FINAL DAY.

22
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:35,669
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE HAD TO GO

23
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:36,603
THROUGH THAT, AND IT'S REALLY

24
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:37,604
NOT OKAY.

25
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:39,038
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER.

26
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:39,706
NOBODY'S GOING
TO TAKE HER AWAY

27
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:44,844
FROM ME WITHOUT A FIGHT.

28
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,379
HOW WILL IT ALL END?

29
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,014
I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN HONEST WITH

30
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:47,714
YOU.

31
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,081
WHY, ZACH?

32
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,082
OH, MY GOD

33
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,250
TEARS OF JOY.

34
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,752
I JUST LOVE HER.

35
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:56,489
I WANT THE BEST FOR HER.

36
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,057
OR TEARS OF
UTTER HEARTBREAK?

37
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,625
I FEEL SO
BLINDSIDED BY YOU.

38
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,761
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,

39
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:02,429
WALK AWAY BECAUSE
HE'S NOT READY

40
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,264
TO PROPOSE?

41
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:05,966
AND JUST WHEN
YOU THINK IT'S

42
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:06,833
ALL OVER...

43
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:07,534
YOU'RE LYING STRAIGHT TO MY

44
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:08,668
FACE.

45
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:09,369
LOOK ME IN THE EYES AND LIE TO

46
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,404
ME AGAIN.

47
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,172
THE CRAZY DRAMA CONTINUES.

48
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,174
I WANT AN
ANSWER FOR WHY YOU

49
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,577
DID WHAT YOU DID.

50
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,245
I'M SORRY.

51
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,981
THIS IS ACTUALLY CRAZY.

52
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,482
THE TELEVISION EVENT OF THE

53
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,285

THANK YOU.

IT WILL HAVE ALL OF AMERICA

68
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,098
STUNNED.

00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,965
RACHEL, LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE,

106
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:21,935

YOUR JOURNEYS TO FIND LOVE.

00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,042
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

111
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,210
DEFINITELY NERVOUS.

112
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,945
IT'S HARD TO RELIVE EVERYTHING

113
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:33,814
THAT WE ARE EXCITED I THINK.

114
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:35,614
I'VE BEEN IN THAT SEAT SO I

115
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,483
KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL.

116
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,151
I CAN RELATE.

117
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,419
IT'S BEEN A MINUTE.

118
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,754
GABY, IT'S BEEN
A COUPLE MONTHS

119
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,957
SINCE WE GOT DONE FILMING IN

120
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,025
MEXICO.

121
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:46,993
I DIDN'T HAVE EXPECTATIONS

122
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:49,729
GOING IN SO I THINK WITH THAT

123
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,730
MIND-SET, IT'S BIGGER AND MORE

124
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,965
LIFE-CHANGING
THAN I EVER COULD

125
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:53,966
HAVE IMAGINED.

126
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,000
WE ARE JUST SCRATCHING THE

127
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:55,668
SURFACE.

128
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,169
WE HAVE GOT SO
MUCH TO GET INTO.

129
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,505
I THINK WE NEED
TO PICK UP WHERE

130
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,707
WE LEFT OFF, RACHEL, WITH YOU

131
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:07,413
AND ZACH AT THE ROSE CEREMONY.

132
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:12,885
ARE YOU READY?

133
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,386
OKAY, BACHELOR NATION,

134
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,021
HERE WE GO.

135
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:15,589
THE MOST DRAMATIC FINALE IN

136
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,390
BACHELORETTE HISTORY

137
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:23,562
AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

138
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:27,466
RACHEL, CAN WE SPEAK?

139
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:32,772
YEAH.

140
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,373
WHY, ZACH?

141
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:41,374
OH, MY GOD.

142
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,088
UM, I THINK IT'S...

143
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,956
I'M SURE YOU FEEL THAT THE

144
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,591
FANTASY SUITE
FELT A LITTLE OFF.

145
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,192
YEAH.

146
00:04:52,193 --> 00:04:55,327
WITH US.

147
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,829
AND YOU KNOW, SINCE DAY ONE,

148
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,397
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST

149
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:58,697
WITH YOU...

150
00:04:58,698 --> 00:04:58,932
YEAH.

151
00:04:58,932 --> 00:04:59,466
AND UPFRONT ABOUT MY

152
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:00,666
FEELINGS.

153
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,435
AND TO BE HONEST,
I THOUGHT WHAT

154
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,603
I WAS SEEING WASN'T THE REAL

155
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,472
RACHEL.

156
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,374
I FELT LIKE I WAS SEEING

157
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,408
BACHELORETTE RACHEL, NOT THE

158
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,943
REAL RACHEL THAT I'D COME TO

159
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:11,778
KNOW AND LOVE.

160
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:14,847
OKAY.

161
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,048
HIS LOOK WHEN
HE ASKED HER TO

162
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,216
WALK OUT, HE JUST
LOOKED, LIKE,

163
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,185
PRETTY...

164
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:19,686
UPSET.

165
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:20,886
YEAH.

166
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,788
INTERESTING.

167
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:23,889
I GUESS HE KIND OF SAW IT AS A

168
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,891
NOW OR NEVER.

169
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,493
YOU KNOW, AT
THIS POINT LATE

170
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,395
IN THE STAGE WHERE I EXPRESSED

171
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,629
AND SHOWN, LIKE, MY ABSOLUTE

172
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,464
LOVE...

173
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:31,998
YEAH.

174
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,768
FOR YOU, AND
I FEEL UPSET AND

175
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,503
DISAPPOINTED THAT
I WASN'T ABLE

176
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,472
TO GET THAT FROM YOU.

177
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,641
I DO UNDERSTAND MAYBE YOU

178
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,944
WERE PICKING UP
ON A LITTLE BIT

179
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,946
OF A DIFFERENT VIBE.

180
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,180
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GAIN

181
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,648
CLARITY THIS WEEK
AS WELL, AND I

182
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,584
DO REALLY FEEL LIKE I DID FIND

183
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,885
IT.

184
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,054
I FELT LIKE
THE CONCERNS WITH

185
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:55,422
THE AGE PART...

186
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:56,089
YEAH.

187
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,491
WAS A COMPLETE KIND OF

188
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,360
BLINDSIDE.

189
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,662
I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIND

190
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,898
THAT MISSING PIECE FOR ME.

191
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,268
AND I DID THINK
IF WE COULD JUST

192
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,636
SPEND THE NIGHT TALKING THAT

193
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:15,641
MAYBE I COULD FIND IT.

194
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:16,809
IT'S JUST,
IT'S KIND OF HARD

195
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:23,449
TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND IT.

196
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,117
YEAH, I DID REALLY LOVE YOU.

197
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,418
YOU KNOW.

198
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:34,419
I SAW A FUTURE WITH YOU.

199
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:43,528
BUT I NEED TO GO.

200
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,971
I TRULY NEED
YOU TO KNOW THAT

201
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,208
I WISH I COULD HAVE GOTTEN TH

202
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,542
THERE.

203
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,977
BUT YOU KNOW,
A RELATIONSHIP

204
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,746
IS A TWO-WAY ROAD, AND, YOU

205
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,581
KNOW, I CAN'T
MAKE IT ANY OTHER

206
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,048
WAY.

207
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,117
AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW.

208
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,285
OH, JEEZ LOUISE.

209
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,552
THAT WOULD BE, I BELIEVE,

210
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,254
ZACH GETTING
WALKED OUT, IF YOU

211
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,388
ARE READING THIS
CORRECTLY TOO.

212
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,422
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT IT'S

213
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,990
LOOKING LIKE.

214
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:12,991
THIS IS AWKWARD.

215
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,226
THAT'S REALLY SAD.

216
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:48,227
HONESTLY THIS IS SO SAD.

217
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:52,972
IT'S OVER JUST LIKE THAT.

218
00:07:52,973 --> 00:08:00,846
JUST LIKE THAT.

219
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,181
I CAN SEE IN HER EYES THAT IT

220
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:03,349
REALLY MEANT
SOMETHING DIFFERENT

221
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,883
TO HER THAN IT DID TO ME.

222
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:08,988
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I MISSED.

223
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:09,989
I MEAN, I SAW IT THAT NIGHT IN

224
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,590
THE FANTASY SUITE THAT IT WAS

225
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:14,893
OFF.

226
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:15,228
I DON'T KNOW.

227
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:15,862
BUT, LIKE, IT
STILL DOESN'T FEEL

228
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,730
REAL.

229
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,666
LIKE, SHE WAS, IN MY MIND,

230
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:28,667
THE FUTURE MRS. SHALLCROSS.

231
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,275
OH, MY GOODNESS.

232
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:34,980
I'M SO SORRY.

233
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,048
UM, ZACH LEFT.

234
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:37,549
I DO WISH HIM THE BEST.

235
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,984
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO SPEAK

236
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,019
ILL.

237
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,587
BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ESPECIALLY

238
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,188
SAY THAT THEY CARE ABOUT ME TO

239
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,523
KIND OF TAKE THINGS INTO THEIR

240
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,458
OWN HANDS AND QUESTION MY

241
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,559
CHARACTER, IT'S
OBVIOUSLY REALLY

242
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
DISAPPOINTING.

243
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,362
I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY OTHER

244
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,965
WORDS.

245
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:57,336
HER RESPONSE, IT FELT SO

246
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,005
COLD THAT I THOUGHT
MAYBE THAT I

247
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,541
MEANT MORE, BUT I GUESS I

248
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:02,776
DIDN'T.

249
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:08,614
TINO?

250
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,949
TINO, WILL YOU
ACCEPT THIS ROSE?

251
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,719
ALWAYS.

252
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,589
ONE OF THE THINGS I FELL IN

253
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,525
LOVE WITH WAS,
LIKE, SHE MADE ME

254
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:23,295
FEEL...

255
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,965
LIKE, SPECIAL.

256
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,068
AND CARED FOR.

257
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,704
AND...

258
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,739
I QUESTION IF ANY OF THAT WAS

259
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,308
REAL.

260
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:43,215
IF THAT WAS JUST AN ACT.

261
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:43,450
AVEN?

262
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:46,351
AVEN, WILL YOU
ACCEPT THIS ROSE?

263
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:51,457
ABSOLUTELY.

264
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:59,458
OH.

265
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,409
OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS REALLY

266
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,311
HARD TO WATCH.

267
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,679
ARE YOU DOING OKAY?

268
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,714
WHEN WE COME
BACK, YOU'LL GET A

269
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,583
CHANCE TO SPEAK
TO ZACH FOR THE

270
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,419
FIRST TIME SINCE THAT DAY IN

271
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,254
MEXICO.

272
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:21,888
BACHELOR NATION,
DON'T GO AWAY.

273
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:26,793
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

274
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:41,941
WELCOME BACK TO THE LIVE

275
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,775
FINALE OF "THE BACHELORETTE."

276
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,345
I'M HERE WITH RACHEL.

277
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,846
GABBY IS STIL HERE BUT SHE'S

278
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,984
STEPPED AWAY TO
GIVE RACHEL SOME

279
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,787
SPACE.

280
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:56,889
YOU LOOK NERVOUS.

281
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,958
ARE YOU DOING OKAY?

282
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,361
I AM READY TO TALK TO ZACH?

283
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,129
I'M READY.

284
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,964
LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE

285
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:13,965
WELCOME ZACH.

286
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:22,381
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

287
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,850
ZACH, IT'S GREAT HAVING YOU

288
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:25,084
HERE.

289
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,318
I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T SEEN OR

290
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,754
SPOKEN TO RACHEL
SINCE THAT DAY

291
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:29,022
IN MEXICO.

292
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:33,125
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO HER?

293
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,660
WOW, GREAT SEEING YOU.

294
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:37,396
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

295
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:37,997
LITTLE NERVOUS, LITTLE NERVOUS

296
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,098
OF COURSE.

297
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,602
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I DO

298
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:44,636
APOLOGIZE FOR EVER MAKING YOU

299
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:48,140
FEEL LIKE I CALLED YOU OUT FOR

300
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:48,508
YOUR CHARACTER.

301
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:49,775
WATCHING THAT BACK, BOOKS THE

302
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,811
LAST THING I WANTED.

303
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,680
THAT'S THE LAST
THING I WANTED.

304
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,181
I WAS KIND OF IN SHOCK AND

305
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,584
DISBELIEF IN WHAT
WAS HAPPENING

306
00:11:58,585 --> 00:11:58,885
BETWEEN US.

307
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,320
I AM SO SORRY.

308
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,222
I'M SORRY TOO.

309
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,891
I REALLY WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

310
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,426
OBVIOUSLY THERE
WAS REALLY HARD

311
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,361
FOR ME TO WATCH
BACK AND SEE YOU

312
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,662
EMOTIONAL AND I
WANT YOU TO KNOW

313
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,531
THAT THOSE FEELINGS
THAT I HAD,

314
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,466
THEY WERE REAL.

315
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,801
I DON'T EVER WANT YOU TO FEEL

316
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,103
LIKE I WAS PUTTING
ON AN ACT OR

317
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,539
ANYTHING I DO
APOLOGIZE AS WELL.

318
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,841
TAKE US BACK TO THE ROSE

319
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,076
CEREMONY WHEN YOU DECIDED TO

320
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,777
LEAVE AND WALK AWAY.

321
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,679
HOW HARD OF A THAT?

322
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,780
I WAS SICK TO
MY STOMACH THE

323
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:32,584
WHOLE WEEK.

324
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,086
I KNEW FROM OUR NIGHT OF THE

325
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,789
FANTASY SUITE, IT FELT OFF.

326
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,525
THE DAYS LEADING UP TO THE

327
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,427
ROSE CEREMONY,
I WAS CONSTANTLY

328
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,028
FEELING THAT THING IN MY

329
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:43,830
STOMACH.

330
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,430
I HAD TO SHARE WHAT I WAS

331
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,131
FEELING I DIDN'T WANT TO HIDE

332
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,166
THAT FROM YOU.

333
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,570
IT WAS THE TOUGHEST WEEK.

334
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,205
GRANTED, THINGS
HAPPENED THE WAY

335
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,073
THEY DID, AND THAT'S OKAY.

336
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,975
THAT'S WHAT WAS MEANT TO BE.

337
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:57,677
IT WAS A TOUGH, DIFFICULT

338
00:12:57,678 --> 00:13:01,780
SITUATION FOR US BOTH.

339
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,181
AGAIN, I'M SORRY.

340
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,716
I COULD HAVE
HANDLED IT BETTER.

341
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,551
RACHEL, SAFE
TO SAY THAT YOU

342
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:13,525
LOOK PRETTY STUNNED AND CAUGHT

343
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:13,860
OFF GUARD.

344
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:15,027
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU SAID

345
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,128
EVERYTHING YOU
NEEDED TO SAY OR

346
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,830
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT

347
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:19,831
DISPLAYED TO ZACH?

348
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,867
I REALLY WANT YOU TO KNOW

349
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,568
THAT YOU MEANT SO MUCH TO ME.

350
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:27,973
I CARE ABOUT YOU
AND I REALLY DO

351
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,541
WANT ALL THE HAPPINESS IN THE

352
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,742
WORLD FOR YOU.

353
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:31,511
EVERYTHING THAT
HAPPENED, IT WAS

354
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:34,146
AWKWARD AND I AM SORRY.

355
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,981
I WAS REALLY JUST LOOKING FOR

356
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,482
CLARITY AND I WANTED US TO BE

357
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,418
ABLE TO HAVE THAT NIGHT TO SEE

358
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,186
IF WE COULD GET THERE.

359
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,187
ULTIMATELY I JUST COULDN'T.

360
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,488
BUT I NEVER WANT YOU TO FEEL

361
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,791
LIKE I WAS GOING TO PUT YOU

362
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,025
THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF

363
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,027
IT WASN'T A TRULY TO SEE IF WE

364
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:49,729
COULD COME OUT ON THE OTHER

365
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:50,530
SIDE.

366
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,164
I'M SORRY.

367
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,598
I GET THAT.

368
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,133
THERE IS NO ONE
-WAY OR RIGHT WAY

369
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,635
TO NAVIGATE IT.

370
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,137
IT WAS A TOUGH
PILL TO SWALLOW.

371
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,073
IT WASN'T WHAT
I THOUGHT IT WAS

372
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:02,374
GOING TO BE BECAUSE I SAW A

373
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,375
FUTURE WITH YOU.

374
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,676
THE REALITY OF IT WAS THAT IT

375
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,811
JUST WASN'T GOING
TO HAPPEN AND

376
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:09,348
THAT WAS A HARD THING TO REA

377
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:09,582
REALIZE.

378
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,718
I JUST WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

379
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,720
I'M GLAD SEE YOU AFTER ALL OF

380
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,054
THIS TIME.

381
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:19,791
THINGS WERE GOING...

382
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,394
IT'S GOOD TO HEAR
YOU SAY THAT.

383
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:22,929
THINGS WERE GOING SO WELL

384
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,996
BETWEEN THE TWO
OF YOU UP UNTIL

385
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:25,798
THAT OVERNIGHT DATE.

386
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,966
I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE,

387
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,569
THEY ARE WONDERING
IF SOMETHING

388
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,204
NEFARIOUS OR
SOMETHING CRAZY MAN

389
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,139
HAPPENED BEHIND CLOSE DOORS IN

390
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,874
THE OVERNIGHT DATE FOR THE

391
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,476
RELATIONSHIP TO COME CRASHING

392
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:37,909
DOWN THE WAY HE DID.

393
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,145
WHAT DID HAPPEN THAT MIGHT?

394
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,279
RACHEL, PLEASE
CORRECT ME IF

395
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,748
I'M WRONG.

396
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:45,083
IT WAS ONE OF
THOSE MOMENTS WHEN

397
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,018
THE FANTASY SUITE STARTED, WE

398
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,286
WERE IN THERE AND TALKING.

399
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,521
IT KIND OF FELT
IMMEDIATELY OFF.

400
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:52,657
HE FELT LIKE WE
WERE KIND OF TWO

401
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,159
STRANGERS IN A WAY.

402
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,194
I THINK IT WAS
THE MOMENT THAT I

403
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,163
DIDN'T FULLY RECOGNIZE AT THE

404
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:59,898
TIME BUT MAYBE YOU HAD ALREADY

405
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,767
REALIZED I WASN'T GOING TO BE

406
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:02,301
YOUR FUTURE PERSON.

407
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,336
WE HAVE THE REST
OF THE NIGHT TO

408
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,871
STILL HANG OUT AND BE TOGETHER

409
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:09,508
AND IT WAS TOUGH.

410
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,777
IT WASN'T UNTIL THE DAYS AFTER

411
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,278
WHERE IT WAS ALL RIGHT, I NEED

412
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,115
TO SHARE MY FEELINGS.

413
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:21,920
ABOUT HOW THERE ISN'T AN US.

414
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,622
IT STARTED OFF EARLY IN THE

415
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,891
FANTASY SUITE AND IT WAS A

416
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:26,426
TOUGH, TOUGH CONVERSATION.

417
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:29,561
IT WAS JUST OFF.

418
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,430
FELT LIKE TWO VERY DIFFERENT

419
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:31,664
PEOPLE.

420
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:34,800
DOES THAT
SOUND ABOUT RIGHT?

421
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,768
I DO AGAIN WANT YOU TO KNOW

422
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,503
WATCHING IT BACK, I WAS NEVER

423
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,571
ACCUSING YOU OF
NOT BEING READY

424
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,639
AND I DON'T WANT
YOU TO FEEL AS

425
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,307
IF I WAS COMING AFTER YOU.

426
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,209
I JUST WANTED TO
KNOW IF YOU ARE

427
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,677
READY IN GENERAL,
WHICH IS WHEN

428
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,179
I ASKED EVERYONE.

429
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,547
I WANT YOU TO
KNOW THAT'S WHERE

430
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:49,748
I WAS COMING FROM.

431
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,183
I WAS HOPING WE COULD HAVE

432
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,984
CLEARED UP IN
THE MORNING BUT I

433
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,886
DO KNOW THAT IT
WAS AWKWARD FOR

434
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:55,488
BOTH OF US.

435
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:57,022
MAYBE THERE WAS A

436
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:57,423
MISCOMMUNICATION.

437
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,057
BUT I REALLY JUST WANT YOU TO

438
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:02,360
KNOW THAT I WAS NEVER, LIKE,

439
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,795
TRYING TO MAKE IT AWKWARD.

440
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,764
I KNOW.

441
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:05,665
IT WAS TOUGH.

442
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:06,098
IT WAS REALLY TOUGH.

443
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:13,038
THERE IS NO WAY
T WAY TO NAVIGAT

444
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:13,773
THE RIGHT WAY.

445
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:14,507
YOU DID AN ADMIRABLE JOB AND I

446
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:17,409
WAS TRYING TO HANDLE IT WHEN I

447
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:17,610
COULD.

448
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:18,844
DO THE BEST I COULD.

449
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:23,081
I UNFORTUNATELY FAILED.

450
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,282
IT'S OKAY.

451
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,218
YOU HAVE HAD SOME TIME TO

452
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:26,853
PROCESS IT.

453
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:28,920
THINKING BACK TO THAT DAY IN

454
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:29,155
MEXICO.

455
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,790
DO YOU HAVE ANY
REGRETS WALKING

456
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,925
AWAY?

457
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,495
YOU KNOW.

458
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,996
I DON'T REALLY
HAVE ANY REGRETS.

459
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,198
ALL THE MOMENTS I SHARED WITH

460
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,333
YOU, RACHEL, BEING IN L. A. ALL

461
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,202
THE WAY TO
AMSTERDAM, I'LL NEVER

462
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,403
FORGET THOSE MEMORIES.

463
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:49,007
MEXICO WAS GREAT UNTIL IT WA

464
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:49,575
WASN'T.

465
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,176
I WOULDN'T TRADE
ANYTHING IN THE

466
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:51,377
WORLD.

467
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:54,746
EVERYTHING HAPPENS
FOR A REASON.

468
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,815
SO IT WAS GREAT
GETTING TO KNOW

469
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:57,916
YOU.

470
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,551
RACHEL, HOW ABOUT YOU?

471
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,187
ANY REGRETS?

472
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,422
ZACH, YOU'RE SUCH AN

473
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,223
INCREDIBLE GUY.

474
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,225
YOU TRULY MADE THIS EXPERIENCE

475
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,492
FOR ME.

476
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:09,493
I KNOW IT DIDN'T WORK OUT

477
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:10,662
EXACTLY WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE

478
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,764
THOUGHT IN THE
MOMENT BUT I JUST

479
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,031
WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW MUCH I

480
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:16,201
APPRECIATE YOU AND I REALLY DO

481
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,269
APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION

482
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,003
HONESTLY.

483
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,738
ALL RIGHT, ZACH.

484
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,539
BEFORE WE MOVE ON, ANY LAST

485
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,543
WORDS THAT YOU
HAVE FOR RACHEL?

486
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,777
AGAIN.

487
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:26,912
THE MEMORIES WE
SHARED TOGETHER,

488
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,547
I WILL NEVER FORGET THEM.

489
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,814
I REALLY JUST
HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY

490
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,784
AND I WANT THE BEST FOR YOU

491
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:33,753
ALWAYS.

492
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:35,220
YOU'RE AWESOME.

493
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:39,424
FEEL LIKE YOU GOT SOME

494
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:39,725
CLOSURE.

495
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,693
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO DO, TO

496
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:41,460
RELIVE IT.

497
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:42,794
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HONESTY AND

498
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,796
WHILE IT DIDN'T
WORK OUT FOR YOU

499
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,097
ROMANTICALLY IT'S OBVIOUS YOU

500
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,666
HAVE A LOT OF MUTUAL RESPECT.

501
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,467
I LOVE SEEING THAT.

502
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:49,969
THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH.

503
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,438
ZACH, THANK YOU.

504
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:57,676
ALL RIGHT, WHEN WE RETURN, THE

505
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:01,780
REMAINING GUYS
MEET RACHEL'S AND

506
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,281
GABBY'S FAMILIES.

507
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,917
THINGS DON'T GO EXACTLY AS

508
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,519

00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,564
MY WIFE WILL BE REALLY EXCITED

699
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,299

700
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,767

703
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:27,840
DID IT GO BY QUICK FOR YOU?

704
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:29,474
IT WENT BY REALLY QUICK.

705
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:30,075
BUT WE HAVE, LIKE, DONE A LOT

706
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,542
TOGETHER.

707
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,144
UP TO THIS POINT, SO IT FEELS

708
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:33,411
SLOW AT THE SAME TIME.

709
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:33,979
IT'S, LIKE, A WEIRD THING,

710
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,546
YOU KNOW.

711

JUST VERY SPECIAL, ESPECIALLY

714
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,684
SHE'S MET MY FAMILY TOO.

718
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,589
SHE'S VERY SPECIAL TO ME.

719
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,457
IT'S JUST AN HONOR TO MEET YOU

720
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,392

721
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:48,027
WELL, WE ARE
REALLY HAPPY TO

722
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:48,928

723
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:49,961
YEAH, WE'RE EXCITED.

724
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:50,596
I APPRECIATE IT.

725
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:53,631
SLIGHTLY NERVOUS.

726
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:54,233
YEAH, IT IS A NERVE-RACKING

727
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,000
EXPERIENCE BUT, LIKE, AFTER

728
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,968
HEARING EVERYTHING RACHEL SAID

729
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:57,502
ABOUT YOU BEFORE YOU CAME IN.

730
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:59,570
IT WAS NICE.

731
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,872
SOME GOOD STUFF.

732
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,840
SOME NICE THINGS.

733
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:03,742
SEE IF YOU CAN GET BIG TONY

734
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:05,276
TO SMILE.

735
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,411
TRYING MY HARDEST.

736
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:06,879
I GAVE HIM A CIGAR.

737
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,946
WE ARE GETTING SOMEWHERE.

738
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,414
TRYING.

739
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,152
I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FORWARD TO

740
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:14,920
IT, BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS NERVOUS

741
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,521
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU WANT TO

742
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:16,021
MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION.

743
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:17,355
YOU WANT TO REALLY
REMIND THEM,

744
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:18,157
YOU KNOW, WHY YOU'RE HERE AND

745
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:18,791
HOW YOU FEEL
TOWARDS, YOU KNOW,

746
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,625
THEIR DAUGHTER.

747
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,592
LET'S GO TALK.

748
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:24,062
THE FIRST THING I SAID TO

749
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:25,030
RACHEL IS I DO NOT WANT TO END

750
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,331
UP ON BIG TONY'S BAD SIDE.

751
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,066
SO YOU THINK I'M
GOING TO NOT BE

752
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:29,600
HONEST WITH THAT GUY?

753
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,702
ME AND RACHEL ARE FALLING IN

754
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:33,438
LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.

755
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,340
I KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, RACHEL

756
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,240
SEES SOMETHING IN ME AND A

757
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,874
FUTURE WITH ME
THE SAME WAY I DO

758
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,942
WITH HER.

759
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,010
I THINK TODAY IS, LIKE,

760
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:39,878
A BIG DAY TO PROVE THAT.

761
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:42,046
I'M HERE TO PUT YOU ON THE

762
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:42,681
SPOT, BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW, I DON'T

763
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:43,315
WANT TO HEAR SOMEBODY MUMBLING

764
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,450
AROUND.

765
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,218
ABSOLUTELY.

766
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,120
I WANT TO KNOW
WHY, YOU KNOW,

767
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,754
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER.

768
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:50,254
SHE'S MY PRIDE AND JOY.

769
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,790
AND NOBODY IS
GOING TO TAKE HER

770
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,559
AWAY FROM ME WITHOUT A FIGHT.

771
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,727
OF COURSE.

772
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,628
SO TOMORROW I'M GOING TO BE

773
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,097
SITTING IN THIS CHAIR, THERE'S

774
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:00,231
GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT GUY

775
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,499
SITTING IN THAT CHAIR.

776
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,267
YEAH.

777
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:03,401
SO WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO SAY

778
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,737
TODAY THAT'S GOING TO MAKE ME

779
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:06,305
REMEMBER YOU BETTER THAN THE

780
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:07,305
OTHER GUY?

781
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,742
YEAH, I MEAN, I
THINK, YOU KNOW,

782
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:14,045
ONE THING, I'VE
REALLY TRIED TO

783
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:16,447
BE AS OPEN AS HONEST AND AS

784
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:21,719
MYSELF THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

785
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,987
I CONSIDER RACHEL'S

786
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:23,822
FEELINGS IN EVERY
DECISION I'VE

787
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:24,456
MADE GOING THROUGH
THIS BECAUSE

788
00:25:24,457 --> 00:25:25,490
THIS ISN'T, LIKE,
A JOKE TO ME.

789
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:26,791
THIS IS MY LIFE
JUST AS MUCH AS

790
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,292
IT'S HERS, AND I WANT TO MAKE

791
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,696
SURE THAT IF WE
END UP TOGETHER,

792
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,164
THAT IT'S RIGHT
FOR BOTH OF US.

793
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:33,699
WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS?

794
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,932
'CAUSE SHE TOLD
ME HER FEELINGS

795
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:35,167
ABOUT YOU.

796
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,068
WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT

797
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:37,935
HER?

798
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:38,270
ABSOLUTELY.

799
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:39,370
SO I'M GOING TO PUT YOU ON

800
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:39,705
THE SPOT NOW.

801
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:40,706
ABSOLUTELY.

802
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,140
SO I CAN SEE THAT WE SHARED A

803
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,108
LOT OF THE SAME VALUES, WHICH

804
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:45,610
WAS SO IMPORTANT.

805
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,612
SAME SENSE OF HUMOR.

806
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:49,247
YOU KNOW, WE LAUGH TOGETHER.

807
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:51,015
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW,

808
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:51,650
I THINK SHE'S GORGEOUS, ALL OF

809
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:53,451
THAT STUFF.

810
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:54,719
SO IT WAS PRETTY
MUCH EVERYTHING

811
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,187
FOR ME ALL COMBINED AT ONCE.

812
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,755
I COMMUNICATED TO HER AFTER MY

813
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:58,357
HOMETOWN THAT I'M FALLING IN

814
00:25:58,357 --> 00:25:58,991
LOVE WITH HER.

815
00:25:58,991 --> 00:25:59,792
I'M FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOUR

816
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:01,726
DAUGHTER.

817
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,828
AND THE FEELINGS
ARE SO STRONG.

818
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,530
AND IT'S BEEN A PROGRESSION

819
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,198
FOR US.

820
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:07,766
WE'VE BUILT ON EVERY SINGLE

821
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:09,500
MOMENT WE'VE HAD TOGETHER.

822
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,102
I WANT TO STRESS TO YOU JUST

823
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:11,737
ABOUT HOW STRONGLY I DO FEEL

824
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:14,739
TOWARDS RACHEL.

825
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,040
SO WHAT'S YOUR,
LIKE, INITIAL

826
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:16,708
FIRST IMPRESSION OF HIM?

827
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:17,443
OH, I LIKE HIM.

828
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:17,876
YEAH?

829
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:18,644
YEAH.

830
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:21,179
HE SEEMS VERY SWEET.

831
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,747
I MEAN, I LIKE THE WAY HE SAT

832
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:23,981
AND WAS RIGHT
AWAY HOLDING HANDS

833
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,250
WITH YOU AND THE WAY HE WAS

834
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,652
INTERACTING WITH US, HE SEEMED

835
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,887
PRETTY CONFIDENT.

836
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:30,122
YEAH.

837
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:30,789
WITH AVEN, I JUST FEEL LIKE I

838
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,356
TRUST HIM.

839
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,459
IF WE WERE TO BE AT THE END OF

840
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,027
THIS AND AVEN WAS
TO GET DOWN ON

841
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,962
ONE KNEE, HE WOULD BE THE MOST

842
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,730
INCREDIBLE PARTNER, AND I KNOW

843
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,366
THAT FOR SURE.

844
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:42,634
FOR SURE.

845
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:44,168
I HAVE, LIKE, NO
DOUBTS IN HIM.

846
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,604
I LOVE HEARING
YOU SAY THAT.

847
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:46,905
I LIKE THAT.

848
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:49,240
HE'S SO INCREDIBLE.

849
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:49,575
HE'S SO GREAT.

850
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:51,776
RACHEL, I LOVE
THE WAY YOU'RE

851
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,011
TALKING.

852
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:54,346
I CAN SEE IT.

853
00:26:54,347 --> 00:26:55,947
IT'S OVERFLOWING.

854
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,415
I AM SO, SO HAPPY.

855
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,183
I FEEL LIKE ALL THE ANSWERS I

856
00:26:58,184 --> 00:27:00,418
NEED, I KNOW.

857
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,186
SO I'M JUST HOPING
HE CAN, LIKE,

858
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,955
TELL YOU FROM HIS SIDE, HOW HE

859
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,923
FEELS AND SEE WHAT MATCHES UP.

860
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,391
RIGHT AND YOU THINK HE'S

861
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,026
READY TO GET DOWN ON ONE KNEE?

862
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:09,494
YES.

863
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,262
OKAY, GOOD.

864
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:12,131
WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

865
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:12,397
AT LENGTH.

866
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,065
OKAY.

867
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:14,967
YEAH.

868
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:15,300
OH, MY GOSH.

869
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:18,903
I LOVE THAT FACE.

870
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:19,937
YOU'RE SO HAPPY.

871
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:20,806
I KNOW, I'M SO HAPPY, YEAH.

872
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:21,406
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT IT WAS

873
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:22,007
GOING TO BE WEIRD.

874
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:22,808
YOU KNOW, MY
DAUGHTER IS GETTING

875
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,976
ENGAGED, AND I MET THE GUY ONE

876
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:25,177
TIME.

877
00:27:25,178 --> 00:27:26,978
HOW WEIRD THAT IS, YOU KNOW.

878
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:27,779
BUT THE MORE I'M
TALKING TO YOU,

879
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,680
THE MORE CONFIDENCE YOU'RE

880
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:33,151
GIVING ME, SO WOW.

881
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,585
IT'S A LITTLE WILD FOR ME TO

882
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:35,686
THINK THAT IN A COUPLE DAYS

883
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,889
SHE'LL BE ENGAGED.

884
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,624
BUT SHE WAS JUST GUSHING.

885
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,225
THERE WAS NO THINGS THAT I HAD

886
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,293
TO QUESTION HER ON.

887
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,795
SHE WAS JUST HAPPY.

888
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,130
SO I GUESS THIS IS KIND OF,

889
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,000
LIKE, THE BIG
QUESTION, BUT ONE,

890
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,668
HAVE YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE

891
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,470
FALLING IN LOVE
OR IN LOVE WITH

892
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:51,970
RACHEL?

893
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:54,105
YEAH, I'VE TOLD...

894
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:54,706
I EXPRESSED TO RACHEL AFTER MY

895
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:55,307
HOMETOWN THAT I'M FALLING IN

896
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:55,641
LOVE WITH HER.

897
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:55,974
OKAY.

898
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:56,775
YEAH.

899
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:58,142
I GUESS NOW, LIKE, THE NEXT

900
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,777
STEP, THIS ENGAGEMENT COULD

901
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,945
POTENTIALLY HAPPEN SO SOON,

902
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,314
LIKE, IN A MATTER OF DAYS,

903
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:03,649
WHERE ARE YOU?

904
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:04,416
DO YOU THINK THAT
COULD HAPPEN?

905
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:05,417
I WANT TO BE WITH RACHEL AT

906
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:07,552
THE END OF THIS,
LIKE, I WANT TO

907
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:08,586
HAVE A LIFE WITH HER.

908
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,421
AND I WANT THE
ENGAGEMENT ASPECT

909
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,056
OF IT TO BE PERFECT.

910
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,157
'CAUSE, FOR ME, LIKE, SEEING

911
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,725
WHAT MY PARENTS WENT THROUGH,

912
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:15,360
I WANT IT TO BE
A ONE-TIME SHOT

913
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,794
FOR US.

914
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,564
BUT, LIKE.

915
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:20,798
CAN YOU TELL US,
ARE YOU THERE?

916
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:21,733
BUT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY

917
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,334
IS, LIKE, I CAN,
LIKE, 1000% SEE

918
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,136
MYSELF GETTING THERE.

919
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:26,071
DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO

920
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:26,905
GET THERE?

921
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:27,972
I DON'T KNOW.

922
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,840
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME WE

923
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:30,108
HAVE LEFT.

924
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,142
BUT I AM FALLING IN LOVE WITH

925
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:31,743
HER, AND MY FEELINGS ARE VERY

926
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:35,580
STRONG.

927
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:36,248
HOW DOES IT
FEEL THAT I COULD

928
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:40,351
BE ENGAGED IN FIVE DAYS?

929
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:41,419
I THINK I WILL
BE, SO I'M GOING

930
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,354
TO BE ENGAGED IN FIVE DAYS.

931
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:43,621
I'M GOING TO SAY THAT VERY

932
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,089
CONFIDENTLY.

933
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,290
YOU KNOW, I'LL TAKE IT

934
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,592
ONE DAY AT A TIME.

935
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:48,527
I FEEL LIKE HE REALLY IS IN

936
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:51,462
THAT PLACE WHERE HE IS READY.

937
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,030
WHEN I TELL YOU EVERYTHING I

938
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:54,131
WANT IN A PARTNER, I FEEL LIKE

939
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:54,800
HE EMBODIES ALL OF THAT.

940
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:56,500
A FATHER WANTS
TO HEAR THAT.

941
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,668
I DON'T WANT TO PUT MY GUARD

942
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,136
DOWN ALREADY, BUT I LIKED HIM

943
00:28:59,137 --> 00:28:59,805
JUST BECAUSE OF
THE WAY YOU WERE

944
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:02,940
TALKING ABOUT HIM.

945
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,642
I LOVE SEEING YOU THAT HAPPY.

946
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:07,478
WHEN YOU WALK
ABOVE THE GROUND.

947
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,879
AS FAR AS, LIKE, WANTING TO

948
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,381
BE WITH HER AFTER
ALL THIS, IS,

949
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:12,316
LIKE, A NO-DOUBT MY MIND.

950
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,218
AND GETTING TO A POINT OF A

951
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,286
MARRIAGE AND A
LIFE TOGETHER IS

952
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:18,122
SOMETHING I WANT WITH HER.

953
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,557
IT'S JUST ABOUT THE TIMING

954
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:20,192
OF IT.

955
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:21,959
HAVE YOU SAID THAT TO HER?

956
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,694
I'VE EXPRESSED THAT TO HER.

957
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,263
HAVE YOU SAID,
"I DON'T KNOW

958
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:25,864
THAT I WANT TO GET ENGAGED AT

959
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:26,598
THE END OF THIS"?

960
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:27,599
I'VE EXPRESSED
THAT I'M READY

961
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,799
FOR AN ENGAGEMENT.

962
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,167
LIKE, AS FAR AS MY LIFE IS

963
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,535
CONCERNED, LIKE,
WHERE I'M AT IN

964
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:32,471
LIFE.

965
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:33,405
SHE IS READY FOR AN

966
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:34,172
ENGAGEMENT.

967
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:37,141
SHE TALKS ABOUT
IT ALL THE TIME.

968
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,277
AND IF SHE COMES HOME NOT

969
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:39,845
ENGAGED, THAT'S GOING TO BE

970
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:42,113
REALLY HARD.

971
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:42,347
YEAH.

972
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:43,981
WELL, I THINK ULTIMATELY IT

973
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,017
IS A RED FLAG.

974
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:47,718
IT'S NOT HER INTENTION TO COME

975
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,887
HOME WITH A BOYFRIEND.

976
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,323
I DO THINK AVEN NOT WANTING TO

977
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:54,025
BE ENGAGED AT THE END OF THIS

978
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:57,461
PROCESS WILL BE
A DEAL BREAKER.

979
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,763
ENGAGEMENT IS NO JOKE.

980
00:29:58,764 --> 00:29:59,231
A MARRIAGE IS NO JOKE.

981
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,065
I JUST KNOW THAT'S HER

982
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:02,566
INTENTION.

983
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:02,801
YEAH.

984
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:06,304
SO JUST TO
KEEP THAT IN MIND.

985
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:28,392
DO YOU WISH YOU COULD DATE

986
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,394

PINK SHIRT HE WAS WEARING.

998
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,190
THAT'S ALL
EVERYBODY IS TALKING

999
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:04,829
ABOUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

1000

#RealMenWearPink.

1001

WE WATCHED AS AVEN REVEALED HE

1002
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,966
MIGHT NOT BE READY TO GET

1003
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:09,167
ENGAGED.

1004
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,768
IS THAT GOING TO BE A

1005
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,103
DEAL BREAKER FOR RACHEL?

1006
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:18,042
LET'S FIND OUT.

1007
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,311
SO TELL ME EVERYTHING.

1008
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,113

I FEEL, LIKE, THIS WEEK, LIKE,

1011
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,050
I GAINED SO MUCH CLARITY IN MY

1012
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:27,184
OVERNIGHTS.

1013
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,387
AND, LIKE, I WOULD NEVER BRING

DIDN'T SEE THIS
FUTURE WITH HIM

1016
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,190
AND IF HE DIDN'T
FEEL LIKE THIS

1017
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:35,259
COULD BE MY HUSBAND.

1018
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,260
NOT ONLY COULD IT BE,

1019
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:36,995
BUT I SEE IT.

1020

AS AMAZING AS I

1022
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,465
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

1023
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,633
MY FAMILY LOVES AVEN.

1024
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,536
I AM READY FOR AN ENGAGEMENT.

1025
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:46,537
THEY KNOW HOW BIG
OF A DEAL THIS

1026
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:47,139
IS FOR ME, SO I COULD NOT BE

1027
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,340
HAPPIER.

1028
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:50,208
ON PAPER...

1029
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:51,809
MM-HMM, HE'S
THE PERFECT GUY.

1030
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,110
HE'S THE CHOICE.

1031
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:53,712
LIKE, IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE HIM,

1032
00:31:53,713 --> 00:31:55,780
YOU ARE STUPID.

1033
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:56,381
AND IT'S THE WAY THAT YOU,

1034
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,015
LIKE, SAY, LIKE,
WHEN YOU'RE IN

1035
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:57,649
A STRESSFUL
SITUATION, YOU LOOK

1036
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,083
FOR HIM.

1037
00:31:59,084 --> 00:31:59,885
LIKE, YOU WANT THAT.

1038
00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:01,719
THAT'S VALUABLE.

1039
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,187
SPEAKING ON AVEN,

1040
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:04,156
AFTER TALKING WITH HIM.

1041
00:32:04,157 --> 00:32:06,624
I WAS GOING TO SAY, DID YOU

1042
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:06,958
GUYS ASK HIM?

1043
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,192
DID YOU KILL HIM?

1044
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:08,593
DID HE KILL HIM?

1045
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:11,195
NO, HE DIDN'T.

1046
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:13,330
HE JUST SAID HE JUST WAS

1047
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,598
UNSURE THAT, LIKE, THERE WOULD

1048
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,201
BE AN ENGAGEMENT AT THE END.

1049
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:17,736
LIKE, HE COULDN'T GIVE AN

1050
00:32:17,737 --> 00:32:18,836
ANSWER.

1051
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:22,406
HE COULDN'T GIVE ME AN ANSWER.

1052
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,375
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S

1053
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:25,476
NECESSARILY READY FOR AN

1054
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:25,944
ENGAGEMENT BUT THE WAY

1055
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:26,912
THAT HE... LET
ME FINISH BEFORE

1056
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:28,078
YOU FREAK OUT.

1057
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,413
BUT, LIKE, THE WAY HE WORDS IT

1058
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,081
IS, HE KNOWS HE
WANTS TO BE WITH

1059
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,183
YOU.

1060
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:33,217
I THINK HE'S
BEING VERY LOGICAL

1061
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:35,219
ABOUT THIS.

1062
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:35,954
HE SAID I WANT
RACHEL IN MY LIFE

1063
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:36,655
FOREVER.

1064
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:37,489
HE'S, LIKE, THAT'S NOT A

1065
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,056
QUESTION.

1066
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,492
IT'S, LIKE, DO WE GET ENGAGED

1067
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:42,194

1068

1069
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:45,697

1070
00:32:45,698 --> 00:32:47,064
YEAH, BUT THIS IS, LIKE,

1071
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:47,899
SHOCKING BECAUSE THIS IS NOT

1072
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:53,304
WHAT HE TOLD ME.

1073
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,206
HE TOLD US THAT HE TOLD YOU

1074
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:56,106
ALL OF THIS.

1075

I MEAN, HE
TOLD ME, HE'S LIKE

1078
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,544
LIKE, I FEEL GOOD.

1079
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,879
LIKE, I WOULD
NEVER BRING HIM IN

1080
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,547
FRONT OF YOU IF I DIDN'T THINK

1081
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:05,716
SOMEONE WAS, LIKE, READY 100%.

1082
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:06,951
THIS IS, LIKE, SHOCKING.

1083
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:09,220
LIKE, I REALLY THOUGHT HE WAS,

1084
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:10,021
LIKE, GOING TO
SIT DOWN WITH YOU

1085
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:12,756
AND BE LIKE, 100%.

1086
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:13,058
YEAH, NO.

1087
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,059
HE WASN'T LIKE THAT.

1088
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,293
WHOA.

1089
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:19,630
NO.

1090
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:19,998
HE'S EXCITED.

1091
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:21,265
HE'S EXCITED FOR SURE.

1092
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:21,633
HE'S EXCITED.

1093
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:22,833
LIKE, HE DOES...

1094
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,301
HE CARES ABOUT
YOU SO DEEPLY.

1095
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,803
RIGHT, BUT I'M
NOT COMING OUT

1096
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:28,873
OF THIS, LIKE, NOT ENGAGED.

1097
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:31,609
AND I REALLY, LIKE, I'M HAPPY

1098
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,244
THAT YOU GUYS
DID ALSO GET THIS

1099
00:33:32,245 --> 00:33:33,310
CLARITY, TOO, BECAUSE IT'S

1100
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:34,478
SOMETHING I'M
OBVIOUSLY GOING TO

1101
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,447
HAVE TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT, YOU

1102
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:40,751
KNOW.

1103
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:41,353
TO NOT FULLY CONVINCE YOU BOTH

1104
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:41,987
THAT HE IS 100%
FOR ME, THAT'S,

1105
00:33:41,988 --> 00:33:44,021
LIKE, A VERY BIG WORRY FOR ME.

1106
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,055
MM-HMM.

1107
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,490
ESPECIALLY
WITH THE FACT THAT

1108
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:47,858
THIS WHOLE JOURNEY HAS BEEN

1109
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,994
REALLY HARD.

1110
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:51,695
LIKE, NOW TO HAVE
ANOTHER THING.

1111
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,030
YOU KNOW, I KNOW WHAT YOUR

1112
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,966
EXPECTATION IS OUT OF THIS.

1113
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:56,568
AND IF HIS EXPECTATION IS NOT

1114
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:57,801
THE SAME, THEN WE HAVE

1115
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:01,338
A PROBLEM.

1116
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,007
MM-HMM.

1117
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:02,774
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

1118
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:04,275
IT'S A CONVERSATION
YOU'RE GOING

1119
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:04,809
TO HAVE TO HAVE WITH HIM.

1120
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:05,744
I DO NOT THINK
THIS WAS GOING

1121
00:34:05,745 --> 00:34:08,178
TO HAPPEN WITH AVEN AT ALL.

1122
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:08,480
I'M SHOCKED.

1123
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:11,048
I MEAN, ME AND AVEN TALKED AT

1124
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:11,683
LENGTH ABOUT
BEING READY FOR AN

1125
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:12,650
ENGAGEMENT AND BEING READY FOR

1126
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,484
THIS NEXT STEP, AND THIS IS

1127
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:17,288
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN A COUPLE

1128
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,321
DAYS.

1129
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,790
SO WHY WOULD YOU SAY ONE THING

1130
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:20,659
TO ME AND THEN
SAY ANOTHER THING

1131
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,260
TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY?

1132
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:23,929
LIKE, I APPRECIATE
YOUR HONESTY,

1133
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:30,401
BUT WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME?

1134
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,369
OH, THAT WAS AMAZING.

1135
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,271
JUST MEETING ALL OF THEM.

1136
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:35,138
LIKE, THE CONVERSATION I HAD

1137
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,008
WITH NATE AND SAM.

1138
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,042
YEAH, HOW DID THAT GO?

1139
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,778
IT WENT SO WELL.

1140
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:41,779
I COULD JUST TELL
HOW MUCH THEY

1141
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,080
CARE ABOUT YOU
AND I CAN SEE WHY

1142
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,948
YOU HAVE THEM HERE.

1143
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,584
THEY ASKED SOME TOUGH STUFF.

1144
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,486
AND I JUST TRIED
TO BE AS HONEST

1145
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,221
AND OPEN WITH EVERYONE ABOUT,

1146
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,691
YOU KNOW, WHERE WE'RE AT AND

1147
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:54,659
WHERE I'M AT AND EVERYTHING.

1148
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:59,263
SO YEAH, DID YOU, LIKE, HAVE

1149
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,965
ANYTHING THAT YOU
WANTED TO ASK?

1150
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:01,333
OKAY.

1151
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:01,933
YEAH.

1152
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:05,235
SO OBVIOUSLY I TOLD THEM

1153
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,537
EVERYTHING I FELT AND, LIKE,

1154
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:09,206
THEY ARE SO HAPPY TO SEE ME SO

1155
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:09,407
HAPPY.

1156
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:11,208
I GUESS, LIKE, I'M, LIKE,

1157
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:14,545
A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED.

1158
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,214
BECAUSE THEY EXPRESSED TO ME

1159
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:21,352
THAT MAY BE YOU MIGHT NOT BE

1160
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,253
READY FOR AN ENGAGEMENT.

1161
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:25,222

AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

1164
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:26,791

CHANGED IN TERMS OF

00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:27,858
HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

1166

AND I WANT TO
GET TO THAT POINT

1170
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:34,698

00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,301

1179
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,984
AFTER THIS AND, LIKE, YOU KNOW

1180
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,053
THIS IS WHAT I WANT SO, LIKE,

1181
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:57,421
YOU DON'T FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE READY

1182
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:59,523
TO GET ENGAGED?

1183
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:00,824
I DO FEEL LIKE I'M READY TO

1184
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,126
GET ENGAGED.

1185
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,027
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

1186
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:02,527
IT'S RIGHT.

1187
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:03,761
I'M SO CONFUSED.

1188
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,729
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

1189
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,665
I...

1190
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,600
I STRESSED TO THEM I WANT

1191
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:10,368
NOTHING MORE THAN
TO BE WITH YOU

1192
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:13,103
AFTER THIS.

1193
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:13,638
I KNOW THAT THERE'S STILL

1194
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,506
SOMEBODY INVOLVED IN THIS.

1195
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:16,340
THAT'S ANOTHER THING.

1196
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,408
OKAY, BUT AVEN,

1197
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:18,909
THIS IS ABOUT US.

1198
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,177
I KNOW.

1199
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:20,178
BUT RACHEL, THIS
IS, LIKE, BOTH

1200
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:20,812
OF OUR LIVES.

1201
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:22,012
THIS IS A VERY BIG DEAL.

1202
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,614
I KNOW, AND I'M BEING

1203
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:22,847
SERIOUS.

1204
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,314
I KNOW YOU ARE.

1205
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:25,416
I KNOW YOU ARE.

1206
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:26,517
IS IT, LIKE, CRAZY FOR ME TO

1207
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:27,651
THINK THAT, LIKE,
WE ARE GETTING

1208
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:28,486
TO THAT POINT AND I'M JUST

1209
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:29,720
TRYING TO MAKE SURE...

1210
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:31,755
IT'S NOT CRAZY,
BUT WE TALKED

1211
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:32,057
ABOUT THIS.

1212
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:33,323
WHY AM I TELLING EVERYONE IN

1213
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,292
THERE, "I'M SERIOUS," AND

1214
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:35,293
YOU'RE, LIKE,
"I'M NOT READY TO

1215
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:37,327
GET ENGAGED."

1216
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:38,495
SO, LIKE, WHY IS
THAT HAPPENING?

1217
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,164
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHERE I'M COMING

1218
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,031
FROM?

1219
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:40,932
I DO.

1220
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:41,800
LIKE, THIS IS,
LIKE, HARD FOR

1221
00:36:41,801 --> 00:36:43,133
ME BECAUSE I SEE
YOU AT THE END

1222
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:43,468
OF THIS.

1223
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:44,035
LIKE, THAT'S HARD FOR ME TO

1224
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,537
HEAR.

1225
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:07,024
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY

1226
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:08,726
ARE SITTING THERE
BEING, LIKE "I

1227
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,627
DON'T THINK HE'S READY TO GET

1228
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:11,596
ENGAGED."

1229
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:12,930
LIKE, WHERE IS
THAT COMING FROM?

1230
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:13,598
IT'S NOT COMING
FROM ANYTHING

1231
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,799
THAT HAS TO DO
WITH WHERE I'M AT

1232
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,034
WITH YOU.

1233
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:16,868
I SEE US IN THE
END OF THIS TOO,

1234
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:17,135

I DO.

1236
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,503
I'M TRYING TO
MAKE SURE THAT THE

1237
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:20,138
ENGAGEMENT IS THE
BEST THING FOR

1238
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:20,438
BOTH OF US.

1239
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,072
MY FEELING TOWARDS
YOU HAVE NOT

1240
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:21,773
CHANGED AT ALL.

1241
00:37:21,774 --> 00:37:23,373
AT ALL.

1242
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,242
I KNOW BUT, LIKE, BUT AVEN

00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:33,917
LIKE, I DON'T
LIKE PEOPLE COMING

1249
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,052

1250
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:35,720

00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,488
LIKE, THAT'S HARD FOR ME.

1252
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:38,122
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

1253
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:38,890
LIKE, I WANTED
EVERYONE IN THERE

1254
00:37:38,891 --> 00:37:42,426

1255
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,861
LIKE, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

1256
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:45,329

00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,264
I UNDERSTAND WHERE IT'S

1258

1262
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:53,203
JUST BE AS OPEN WITH YOU ABOUT

I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

1265
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,375
I'M LISTENING TO YOU.

1266
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,009
AND I'M SORRY
IF I AM COMING

1267
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,176
OFF STRONG RIGHT NOW.

1268
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,078
I'M NOT TRYING TO.

1269
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,045
I JUST REALLY
CARE ABOUT YOU AND

1270
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:02,479
I CARE ABOUT US.

1271
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,681
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.

1272
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,517
LIKE, LIKE, I HAVE NO DOUBT IN

1273
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:12,856
MY MIND ABOUT US
GETTING THERE.

1274
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:13,391
WHETHER IT'S IN A FEW DAYS

1275
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:15,159
OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE,

1276
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,393
RACHEL.

1277
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:17,394
I JUST WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

1278
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:18,062
AND I'M SORRY IF
WHAT THEY SAID

1279
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:20,898
YOU CAME OFF DIFFERENTLY.

1280
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:21,566
BUT WHAT IF
WHAT I WANT IS TO

1281
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:23,333
GET ENGAGED?

1282
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:23,902
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,

THEN...

1284

DON'T WANT.

1287
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,373
IT'S NOT ABOUT NOT

1288
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:29,974
WANTING IT.

1289
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,241
I'M JUST TELLING YOU

OH, MY GOODNESS.

1301
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,526
EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE TO THIS

1302
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,161
POINT HAS MADE
ME FEEL THE WAY I

1303
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:51,162

1304
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,963
I'M FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU.

1305
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:56,166
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND

1306
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,235
THROW WORDS AROUND
IN YOUR FACE

1307
00:38:58,236 --> 00:38:59,870
BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU HAPPY.

1308
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:01,905
I'M GOING TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

1309
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:02,740
I KNOW, BUT YOU TOLD ME...

1310

THAT'S ONLY FAIR TO YOU.

1311
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:05,709
THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

1312
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,844
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1313
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:07,445
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE READY

1314
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,079
FOR AN ENGAGEMENT.

1315
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,746
I AM READY.

1316
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,515
BUT WHY ARE
THEY SAYING THAT

1317
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:11,983
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T?

1318
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:13,350
BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE

1319
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,018
THAT THE TIMING
OF IT IS RIGHT,

1320
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:15,253
RACHEL.

1321
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:15,987
WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT ME?

1322
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:17,387
I'M SORRY.

1323
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:17,922
I'M NOT TRYING TO YELL.

1324
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:19,623
I'M JUST VERY... I'M TRYING.

1325
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,391
I'M VERY PASSIONATE.

1326
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:21,926
I'M SORRY.

1327
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:25,729
I'M NOT TRYING TO YELL AT YOU.

1328
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,664
ALL I WANTED
WAS FOR US TO GO

1329
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,332
INTO THIS ON THE SAME PAGE.

1330
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,267
SO NOW WHY DO I FEEL LIKE YOU

1331
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:30,034
JUST DIDN'T TELL ME WHAT PAGE

1332
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,236
YOU WERE ON.

1333
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:32,937
I DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE TO

1334
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:34,805
TALK TO YOU AFTER LAST WEEK.

1335
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:35,440
AFTER OVERNIGHTS,
YOU CHANGED

1336
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:36,607
YOUR MIND?

1337
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:37,608
NO, DIDN'T.

1338
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:38,876
OH, MY GOSH.

1339
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,611
I DID NOT CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT

1340
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:40,879
ANYTHING.

1341
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,012
YOU NEED TO
UNDERSTAND ALSO,

1342
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,914
LIKE, I WANT
SOMEONE WHO CAN SIT

1343
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:44,682
IN FRONT OF MY FAMILY AND BE

1344
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:46,016
LIKE, "THIS IS 100%.

1345
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,718
I'M SO CONFIDENT."

1346
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,386
LIKE, THE FACT THAT YOU'RE,

1347
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,355
LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW,"

1348
00:39:50,356 --> 00:39:52,055
THAT'S, LIKE, HARD FOR ME.

1349
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:52,991
I'M NOT INCONFIDENT IN US.

1350
00:39:52,992 --> 00:40:00,330
AT ALL.

1351
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:01,932
I WANT YOU IN THE END OF THIS.

1352
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:02,966
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

1353
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,501
ENGAGEMENT IS THE RIGHT THING

1354
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:05,969
FOR BOTH OF US AT THIS TIME

1355
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,171
MUTUALLY, OKAY?

1356
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,374
I PROMISE YOU.

1357
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,875
AND I'M SORRY.

1358
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,377
I DO NOT WANT TO EVER SEE YOU

1359
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:14,012
UPSET, ESPECIALLY
IF IT'S LIKE,

1360
00:40:14,013 --> 00:40:15,279
LIKE, ME MAKING YOU UPSET.

1361
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,247
LIKE, I CAN'T...

1362
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:21,418
I DON'T WANT THAT AT ALL.

1363
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:26,323
YEAH.

1364
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:27,324
READY?

1365
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:34,598
YEAH.

1366
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,466
I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO END THIS

1367
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,567
ON A BAD NOTE.

1368
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:38,069
IT'S NOT A BAD NOTE.

1369
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,870
I UNDERSTAND.

1370
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,204
I JUST NEED YOU

1371
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:41,673
TO UNDERSTAND ME TOO.

1372
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:42,607
I KNOW, AND THAT'S...

1373
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:42,907
I KNOW.

1374
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:43,941
I UNDERSTAND.

1375
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:44,642
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE HONEST

1376
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:45,276
WITH YOU.

1377
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,210
AND I KNOW YOU ARE.

1378
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:47,411
EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING IS

1379
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:47,946
OBVIOUSLY ADDING TO THIS.

1380
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:49,079
I KNOW.

1381
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,482
AND I KNOW YOU'RE
BEING HONEST.

1382
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:53,684
IT'S NOT A BAD NOTE.

1383
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:57,120
OKAY.

1384
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:02,225
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

1385
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:02,627
OKAY?

1386
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,127
I'M SORRY.

1387
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,428
I HAD A REALLY GRAT

1388
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:05,029
CONVERSATION WITH ALL OF THEM.

1389
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:05,530
I LOVE ALL OF THEM.

1390
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:06,531
AND I CAME IN
HERE TRYING TO BE

1391
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:08,799
MYSELF AND BE
REAL AND BE HONEST

1392
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,434
AND CONSIDER YOUR FEELINGS

1393
00:41:09,435 --> 00:41:11,868
IN ALL OF THIS.

1394
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,203
AND I'M HERE FOR YOU, OKAY?

1395
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:13,404
I AM.

1396
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,272
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

1397
00:41:14,273 --> 00:41:16,340
I NEED YOU TO
KNOW THAT BEFORE I

1398
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:16,774
WALK AWAY FROM HERE.

1399
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:17,375
OKAY.

1400
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:20,477
OKAY?

1401
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,145
ARE YOU OKAY?

1402
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,312
I'M OKAY.

1403
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,313
PROMISE.

1404
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:23,748
MM-HMM.

1405
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:24,549
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

1406
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,582
SEE YOU.

1407
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,551
OKAY.

1408
00:41:26,552 --> 00:41:34,552
YEAH.

1409
00:41:36,128 --> 00:41:40,497
I JUST FEEL SHOOK UP.

1410
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,332
AT THIS POINT, I
JUST REALLY AM,

1411
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,601
LIKE, NOT SURE HOW AVEN AND I

1412
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,104
MOVE FORWARD FROM IT.

1413
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,138
I JUST FEEL REALLY CONFUSED

1414
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:54,177
AND BLINDSIDED.

1415
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,846
LIKE, HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO HAVE

1416
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,347
CONFIDENCE IN ANYTHING ANYONE

1417
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,751
SAYS TO ME?

1418
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:01,752
LIKE, HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO TRUST

1419
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:04,488
ANYONE?

1420
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:08,425
EVERYONE IS LYING TO ME.

1421
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:09,394
IS IT BETTER JUST TO LEAVE BY

1422
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:09,861
MYSELF?

1423
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:13,897
LIKE, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

1424
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:47,465
WELCOME BACK
TO THE TWO-NIGHT

1425
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:47,965
LIVE FINALE OF

1426
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:48,733
"THE BACHELORETTE!"

1427
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:49,267
GABBY AND RACHEL ARE HERE

1428
00:42:49,268 --> 00:42:51,368
WATCHING ALONG WITH OUR STUDIO

1429
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:51,903
AUDIENCE AND THE REST OF

1430
00:42:51,904 --> 00:42:56,273
AMERICA.

1431
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:58,542
ALL I'VE GOT TO
SAY I FEEL LIKE

1432
00:42:58,543 --> 00:42:59,843
EVERYONE HERE HONESTLY IS A

1433
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:01,211
LITTLE BIT SHOCKED
BY WHAT THEY

1434
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:03,814
JUST SAW BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

1435
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:05,649
ANYONE REALLY EXPECTED AVEN TO

1436
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,384
EVER QUESTION GETTING ENGAGED.

1437
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:08,385
RACHEL, WATCH YOUR FACE IN THE

1438
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:09,619
VIDEO AND YOU WERE TALKING TO

1439
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,988
AVEN, I THINK IT SAYS IT ALL.

1440
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,024
WHAT WAS GOING
THROUGH YOUR MIND

1441
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:16,526
WHEN AVEN WAS EXPRESSING HIS

1442
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:17,261
TREPIDATION WITH A PROPOSAL?

1443
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,596
I THINK FOR ME IT WAS JUST

1444
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,932
REALLY HARD BECAUSE I DID WALK

1445
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:22,966
IN SO CONFIDENT.

1446
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:23,868
IT'S A KIND OF GET HIT WITH

1447
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:25,735
THAT, IT WAS JUST REALLY TOUGH

1448
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:25,970
FOR ME.

1449
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:28,605
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE ON THE

1450
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,040
SAME PAGE.

1451
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:31,708
GABBY, CAN YOU HELP PEOPLE AT

1452
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:32,943
HOME UNDERSTAND
JUST HOW INTENSE

1453
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,178
ARE THOSE CONVERSATIONS YOU'RE

1454
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,713
HAVING ABOUT COMMITMENT?

1455
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,548
YOU KNOW THAT A PROPOSAL, IT

1456
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,350
MIGHT BE DAYS AWAY.

1457
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:41,551
I THINK THESE CONVERSATIONS

1458
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:42,719
ARE MAKE OR BREAK AND IT DOES

1459
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,090
SEEM LIKE THE END DATE SOMEHOW

1460
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:47,925
SPEEDS UP THEN
YOU HAVE TO WEIGH

1461
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:49,860
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

1462
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:51,328
THAT'S WHEN THINGS CATCH UP TO

1463
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:51,496
YOU.

1464
00:43:51,497 --> 00:43:53,330
YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH

1465
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:54,065
YOURSELF AND KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT

1466
00:43:54,066 --> 00:43:56,933
WHICH I THINK
THAT'S WHAT RACHEL

1467
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:57,101
DID.

1468
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:59,169
EVEN WITH
AVEN'S HESITATIONS

1469
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,738
AT THAT POINT,
YOU STILL WANTED

1470
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,106
TO MOVE FORWARD.

1471
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:03,374
HOW COME?

1472
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:06,209
I MEAN, I JUST REALLY WAS

1473
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:06,978
HOPING THIS WAS SOMETHING WE

1474
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:08,578
COULD GET PAST THAT WE COULD

1475
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:09,946
KIND OF GET BACK ON THE SAME

1476
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:10,515
PAGE.

1477
00:44:10,516 --> 00:44:12,816
THAT'S WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR.

1478
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:15,952
YOU WEREN'T THE ONLY ONE

1479
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:17,087
HAVING FAMILY IN MEXICO.

1480
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:19,890
GABBY, IT IS ERICH'S TURN TO

1481
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:20,758
MEET YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR

1482
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:21,192
BELOVED GRANDPA.

1483
00:44:21,193 --> 00:44:23,360
IT'S GOING TO BE
THE SECOND TIME

1484
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:24,628
THAT HE MEETS JOHN.

1485
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:26,196
THAT'S RIGHT.

1486
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:28,265
A DOUBLE DOSE OF GRANDPA JOHN.

1487
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:30,066
A DOUBLE SHOT.

1488
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,168
HOW IS IT GOING TO GO?

1489
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:37,908
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

1490
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:39,376
READY TO SEE GABBY.

1491
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:40,810
I KNOW.

1492
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:41,045
YEAH.

1493
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:41,712
IT'S HARD WHEN
YOU CAN'T REALLY

1494
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:43,113
HEAR FROM HER.

1495
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:47,184
WELL, MY GUESS IS SHE FOUND

1496
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,920
HER PERFECT PERSON.

1497
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,254
THERE'S OUR GIRL!

1498
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:00,664
HEY, SHRIMP.

1499
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:02,098
OH, MY GOSH, GRANDPA,

1500
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:02,500
YOU LOOK SO NICE.

1501
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,000
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1502
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,968
I DON'T ALWAYS LOOK NICE?

1503
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:05,001
I LOVE MY
FAMILY, SO, SO MUCH

1504
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:07,837
AND I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT THEY

1505
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:08,372
ARE HERE.

1506
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:11,341

I REALLY LIKED HIM A LOT.

1528
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:42,873

TELL HIM I LOVED

1529
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:43,040

1530
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,575

00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:46,944

00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:49,446
WELL, HE'S A LIKABLE GUY.

1535
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:51,081

00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:51,415

00:46:03,628 --> 00:46:07,097
EVER COME.

1546
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:09,666
I DIDN'T THINK MY FAMILY

1547
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:11,368
WOULD EVER REALLY BE MEETING A

1548
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:11,802
POTENTIAL HUSBAND.

1549
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:13,737

1552
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:20,110
THE PERSON THAT I WANT TO BE

00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:21,278

I KNOW YOU.

1562
00:46:32,758 --> 00:46:34,257
HOW ARE YOU?

1563
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,659
ARE YOU DOING ANY BOWLING

1564
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,193
BETWEEN YOUR LEGS ANYMORE?

1565
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:41,364
NO.

1566
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:42,066
I DIDN'T GET ANY BETTER.

1567
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:42,933
HOW'S IT GOING?

1568
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:43,467
NICE TO MEET YOU.

1569
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:46,102
NICE TO MEET YOU, ERICH.

1570
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:46,704
I WANT THEM TO ACCEPT ERICH

1571
00:46:46,705 --> 00:46:47,737
AND I WANT ERICH
TO ACCEPT THEM

1572
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:48,539
IN A WAY THAT HE
CAN SEE A LIFE

1573
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,407
WITH ME AND WITH THEM.

1574
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:51,242
SO HOW WAS YOUR HOMETOWN?

1575
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:53,143
MY HOMETOWN WAS AMAZING.

1576
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,411
LIKE, I KNEW GOING INTO THAT,

1577
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:55,379
LIKE, I REALLY WANTED GABBY TO

1578
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,946
MEET MY PARENTS.

1579
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:57,615
AND THEY WERE JUST, LIKE,

1580
00:46:57,616 --> 00:46:59,082
OBSESSED WITH HER.

1581
00:46:59,083 --> 00:46:59,350
REALLY?

1582
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,251
OH.

1583
00:47:00,252 --> 00:47:02,018
THE MOST APPROVAL AND

1584
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:02,953
VALIDATION YOU COULD EVER GET

1585
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:03,888
IS, LIKE, THE PEOPLE THAT MEAN

1586
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:05,255
THE MOST TO YOU.

1587
00:47:05,256 --> 00:47:06,090
ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.

1588
00:47:06,091 --> 00:47:08,291
SO AFTER THAT, I WAS PRETTY

1589
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:09,826
CONVINCED THAT,
YOU KNOW, I WAS

1590
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,961
FALLING IN LOVE WITH HER AND I

1591
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:12,962
WANTED TO TAKE THAT NIGHT TO

1592
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,631
JUST BE, LIKE,
THIS WAS A REALLY

1593
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:15,932
BEAUTIFUL AND
SPECIAL DAY FOR ME

1594
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:16,567
AND, YOU KNOW, I AM FALLING IN

1595
00:47:16,568 --> 00:47:17,934
LOVE WITH YOU.

1596
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,269
I NEEDED TO TELL HER BECAUSE I

1597
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,104
DON'T WANT TO WALK OUT OF HERE

1598
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:20,771
JUST NOT BEING 100% HONEST

1599
00:47:20,772 --> 00:47:24,174
AND TRUE TO THIS.

1600
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,109
I DON'T WANT TO
WALK OUT OF HERE

1601
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:25,676
WITH ANY REGRETS.

1602
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:26,743
I TOLD HIM
EARLIER, YOU KNOW,

1603
00:47:26,744 --> 00:47:28,445
WITH EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN

1604
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:29,779
THROUGH AND HOW
I FEEL ABOUT YOU

1605
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,848
AND HOW MUCH YOU
MEAN TO ME AND

1606
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:32,450
STUFF.

1607
00:47:32,451 --> 00:47:35,285
BUT HEARING YOU SAY IT TO THEM

1608
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:38,555
OBVIOUSLY MEANS THE WORLD.

1609
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:40,590
SO CHEERS.

1610
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,592
I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

1611
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,094
I THINK GABBY IS DEFINITELY

1612
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:44,328
IN LOVE.

1613
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:45,995
I MEAN, SHE SAID IT.

1614
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,831
SHE LOOKS IT.

1615
00:47:47,832 --> 00:47:50,033
YOU CAN TELL JUST
FROM THE GLEAM

1616
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:50,935
IN HER FACE THAT SHE POSSIBLY

1617
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:52,402
HAS FOUND THE PERSON SHE'LL

1618
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:54,104
SPEND THE REST
OF HER LIFE WITH.

1619
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:55,705
AND I THINK HE WOULD FIT IN

1620
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,307
PERFECTLY BECAUSE WE ARE A FUN

1621
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:56,974
FAMILY.

1622
00:47:56,975 --> 00:47:59,409
WE DO ENJOY EACH OTHER'S

1623
00:47:59,410 --> 00:47:59,643
COMPANY.

1624
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:00,977
WE LIKE BEING TOGETHER.

1625
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:01,379
WE'RE VERY CLOSE.

1626
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,746
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1627
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:04,180
I LIKE ERICH.

1628
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,315
HE'S A KEEPER.

1629
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:07,851
YEAH, HE IS.

1630
00:48:07,852 --> 00:48:09,719
MORE IMPORTANT, WHAT DO YOU

1631
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,087
THINK ABOUT HIM?

1632
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:11,154
HE'S BEEN,
LIKE, NOTHING BUT

1633
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:13,423
REALLY, REALLY GOOD TO ME.

1634
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:14,958
HIM EVEN BEING WITH THE FAMILY

1635
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:16,459
AND BEING ABLE TO SAY HOW HE

1636
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,695
FELT ABOUT ME, LIKE, WASN'T

1637
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:20,597
EXPECTING HIM TO DO THAT.

1638
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:22,966
I HOPE HE WOULDN'T DO THAT

1639
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:23,401
UNLESS HE WANTED TO...

1640
00:48:23,402 --> 00:48:24,402
I'M SURE, I'M SURE HE

1641
00:48:24,403 --> 00:48:26,035
WOULDN'T SAY IT
WITHOUT MEANING

1642
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:26,203
IT.

1643
00:48:26,204 --> 00:48:27,204
YEAH.

1644
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:31,474
SO I THINK
HE'S SINCERE ABOUT

1645
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:31,642
IT.

1646
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,243
YOUR GRANDMA WOULD BE TICKLED

1647
00:48:32,244 --> 00:48:33,810
PINK.

1648
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:35,044
I REALLY WISH SHE COULD HAVE

1649
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:35,479
BEEN HERE FOR THIS.

1650
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:35,846
ME TOO.

1651
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:36,647
SHE WOULD HAVE LOVED IT.

1652
00:48:36,648 --> 00:48:38,047
I KNOW.

1653
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,816
AND SHE WOULD'VE GIVEN YOU

1654
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:41,584
THE SAME ADVICE
I'M GIVING YOU.

1655
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,853
IT'S GOT TO BE 90-90.

1656
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:45,388
NOT JUST 50-50.

1657
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:45,623
YEAH.

1658
00:48:45,624 --> 00:48:47,724
OKAY.

1659
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:50,059
ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART.

1660
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,528
I LOVE YOU.

1661
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:52,029

1662
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:52,329
I LOVE YOU.

1663
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,630
YOU TAKE CARE.

1664
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:55,298
I LOVE YOU TOO.

1665
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:56,100
I JUST GET EMOTIONAL.

1666
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:56,967
I'M SORRY.

1667
00:48:56,968 --> 00:48:59,169
OH, GRANDPA.

1668
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,837
THAT'S OKAY.

1669
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:01,172
ALL RIGHT.

1670
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:02,039
I MEAN, I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR

1671
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,339
YOU GUYS AND...

1672
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,841
ME TOO.

1673
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:05,109
I KNOW.

1674
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:05,843
I WISH...

1675
00:49:05,844 --> 00:49:08,478
I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE A DANG

1676
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:11,281
BAD BEAUTIFUL GRANDDAUGHTER.

1677
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:13,349
TALKING TO MY GRANDPA IS

1678
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,251
ALWAYS, LIKE, A
BREATH OF FRESH

1679
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,353
AIR.

1680
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,856
YOU KNOW, HE DID GET REALLY

1681
00:49:19,857 --> 00:49:20,558
EMOTIONAL WITH ME TODAY AND

1682
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,125
HEARING THAT I'M LOVED FROM MY

1683
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,560
GRANDPA AND HAVING HIM GIVE IT

1684
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:26,129
TO ME SO FREELY,
HONESTLY, MEANS

1685
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,931
EVERYTHING.

1686
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:29,032
IT'S NICE TO
FINALLY MEET YOU

1687
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:30,667
AFTER THAT INTRODUCTION,

1688
00:49:30,668 --> 00:49:31,268
HOLY COW, GABBY SEEMS PRETTY

1689
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:32,469
EXCITED.

1690
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,271
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

1691
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:35,906
OBVIOULY YOU
EXPRESSED A LITTLE

1692
00:49:35,907 --> 00:49:37,674
BIT ALREADY.

1693
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:38,675
WHY DO YOU KNOW, I GUESS, THAT

1694
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:40,143
GABBY IS THE RIGHT PERSON?

1695
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,045
IF YOU REALLY FEEL THAT WAY?

1696
00:49:42,046 --> 00:49:43,179
LIKE, WE HAD THIS CRAZY

1697
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,014
CONNECTION FROM THE BEGINNING

1698
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:45,883
AND I WAS HONESTLY INTIMIDATED

1699
00:49:45,884 --> 00:49:47,450
BY HER.

1700
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:48,352
BECAUSE SHE WAS,
LIKE, MAKING A

1701
00:49:48,353 --> 00:49:50,253
LOT OF JOKES AND
PICKING POINTS

1702
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:51,855
OF MY INSECURITIES.

1703
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:53,289
I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, THIS IS,

1704
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:53,757
LIKE..."

1705
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:55,291
BUT WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE WAS

1706
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:56,459
THAT I WAS GOING TO FALL FOR

1707
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,562
YOUR DAUGHTER AND I'M OBSESSED

1708
00:49:59,563 --> 00:49:59,830
WITH HER.

1709
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:00,897
I THINK SHE'S AN
AMAZING PERSON

1710
00:50:00,898 --> 00:50:01,931
AND I CAN'T IMAGINE MY LIFE

1711
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,867
WITHOUT HER AT THIS POINT.

1712
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:05,235
WOW.

1713
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:06,036
THAT MAKES US HAPPY.

1714
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:07,837
YEAH, THAT DOES.

1715
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:08,072
YEAH.

1716
00:50:08,072 --> 00:50:08,839
WE JUST LIKE THE FACT THAT

1717
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,440
SHE GOES, "WELL, I COULD HAVE

1718
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:11,241
BROUGHT THESE OTHER PEOPLE.

1719
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:11,909
BUT WHY, WHEN I KNOW WHO I

1720
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,711
WANT?"

1721
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:15,845
SHE IS VERY CERTAIN FOR THE

1722
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,347
FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE.

1723
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:18,882
WE ARE KIND OF GUARDED OVER

1724
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:20,049
HER HEART, SO WE
DON'T WANT HER

1725
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:20,351
TO GET HURT.

1726
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:20,985
NO.

1727
00:50:20,986 --> 00:50:23,019
EXACTLY.

1728
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:23,654
JUST BECAUSE OF
WHAT SHE'S GONE

1729
00:50:23,655 --> 00:50:25,154
THROUGH, YOU KNOW, WITH MYSELF

1730
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:28,024
AND HER MOM EARLY ON.

1731
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,592
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

1732
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:31,728
I THINK SHE NEEDS SOMEBODY TO

1733
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:33,730
VALIDATE THAT SHE
IS WORTHY OF A

1734
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:35,565
GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

1735
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:36,300
YEAH.

1736
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,034
YOU KNOW.

1737
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:38,067
BECAUSE SHE IS.

1738
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,969
GABBY'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT

1739
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,437
AND SHE REALLY
DOES WANT TO FIND

1740
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:41,639
LOVE.

1741
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,239
I LIKE ERICH A LOT, AND WE ALL

1742
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,340
WANT GABBY TO FINALLY SETTLE

1743
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,476
DOWN AT SOME POINT IN TIME.

1744
00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:51,114
SO IT WOULD BE
GOOD IF SHE DOES.

1745
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:52,215
YOU'VE NEVER COME HOME WITH

1746
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:52,850
SOMEBODY WHERE
YOU SAID "THIS IS

1747
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:55,051
HIM."

1748
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:58,488
I MEAN, WHY ARE YOU SO SURE?

1749
00:50:58,489 --> 00:50:59,789
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT A COUPLE

1750
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:00,524
WEEKS FROM NOW,
YOU'RE NOT GOING

1751
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:01,091
TO BE LIKE "YEAH, THAT WAS

1752
00:51:01,092 --> 00:51:04,894
GOOD."

1753
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,029
BUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT?

1754
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:06,897
I THINK THAT'S
I'VE ALMOST

1755
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:07,997
BEEN AT ODDS WITH MYSELF WITH

1756
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,066
HIM A LITTLE BIT
BECAUSE I THINK

1757
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,234
IT WAS SOME OF
THE "TOO GOOD TO

1758
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:14,070
BE TRUE."

1759
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,872
I CAN'T BELIEVE,
LIKE, I'VE KIND

1760
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:16,774
OF MET SOMEONE LIKE ERICH.

1761
00:51:16,775 --> 00:51:19,108
HE JUST LOVES ME
IN A WAY THAT I

1762
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:21,110
REALLY HAVEN'T HAD BEFORE.

1763
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:21,912
THAT I KNOW I NEED.

1764
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:22,613
YOU DESERVE IT.

1765
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:23,447
YEAH.

1766
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:24,148
YOU DO.

1767
00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:25,715
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

1768
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:27,116
YEAH.

1769
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,151
I DO REALLY THINK WE CAN LAST

1770
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:29,252
A LONG TIME.

1771
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,854
WHICH I THINK IS WHY I GET SO

1772
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:34,624
EMOTIONAL.

1773
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:35,559
YEAH.

1774
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:36,026
YOU JUST NEED TO TRUST

1775
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:36,293
YOURSELF.

1776
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:37,927
YEAH.

1777
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:38,429
DON'T DOUBT YOURSELF.

1778
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,862
YEAH.

1779
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:40,764
WHICH IS HARD, I MEAN, IT'S A

1780
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,966
BATTLE EVERY DAY, EVEN COMING

1781
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:43,534
TODAY, I'M LIKE "IS HE STILL

1782
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:44,534
HERE?"

1783
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,670
BUT I THINK WHEN SOMETHING IS

1784
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:48,805
THAT GOOD, YOU'RE
AFRAID TO LOSE

1785
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:48,973
IT.

1786
00:51:48,974 --> 00:51:50,406
RIGHT.

1787
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:51,741
SO THAT'S HOW
I AM WITH HIM.

1788
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:53,009
I LOVE ERICH MORE THAN I EVER

1789
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:55,812
THOUGHT I COULD REALLY LOVE

1790
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:58,281
SOMEONE.

1791
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:02,118
I GET EMOTIONAL THINKING ABOUT

1792
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,922
MY DAD TALKING TO HIM.

1793
00:52:05,923 --> 00:52:08,725
BREATHE, OKAY?

1794
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:10,760
YOU'RE OKAY.

1795
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:13,196
JUST TAKE A MINUTE.

1796
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:14,397
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE, I DON'T

1797
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:15,531
KNOW IF HE EVER
THOUGHT HE WOULD

1798
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:16,400
HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH

1799
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:18,668
ANYONE.

1800
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:20,036
ALL OF THIS EXACERBATES,

1801
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:21,738
YOU KNOW, NOT HAVING, LIKE,

1802
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:23,840
REALLY FELT LOVE FROM MOM

1803
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:24,108
AND STUFF.

1804
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:25,975
I KNOW.

1805
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:26,644
I HATE THAT FOR YOU.

1806
00:52:26,645 --> 00:52:27,944
I KNOW, BUT...

1807
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:29,345
THAT SUCKS.

1808
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,848
IT'S OKAY.

1809
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:32,416
NO, IT'S REALLY NOT OKAY.

1810
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:34,050
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT.

1811
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:35,385
AND YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE HAD TO GO

1812
00:52:35,386 --> 00:52:35,719
THROUGH THAT.

1813
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,422
I'M REALLY SORRY THAT YOU DID.

1814
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:41,391
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL,

1815
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:45,194
LIKE, SEND A MESSAGE TO ERICH

1816
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:48,031
THAT I'M, LIKE, UNLOVABLE.

1817
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:49,132
IT'S, LIKE, HOW IT MAKES ME

1818
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:50,566
FEEL.

1819
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,101
I GET IT.

1820
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:53,603
I GET IT.

1821
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,405
BUT PROMISE ME SOMETHING.

1822
00:52:55,406 --> 00:52:57,874
DON'T HIDE THIS FROM ERICH.

1823
00:52:57,875 --> 00:52:59,976
IF YOU TRULY FEEL
LIKE ERICH IS

1824
00:52:59,977 --> 00:53:02,679
THE ONE FOR YOU,
LET HIM BE THE

1825
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,714
ONE TO UNDERSTAND YOU.

1826
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:06,249
YOU HAVE TO COMMUNICATE.

1827
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,184
AND YOU HAVE TO
LET HIM SEE YOU

1828
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,585
VULNERABLE AND SEE YOU AT YOUR

1829
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:11,621
WORST AND UNDERSTAND WHY YOU

1830
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:12,722
ARE.

1831
00:53:12,723 --> 00:53:15,558
BECAUSE OF THE THAT

1832
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:16,460
YOU'VE GONE THROUGH.

1833
00:53:16,461 --> 00:53:19,896
LET HIM SEE YOU
FOR ALL THAT YOU

1834
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:20,064
ARE.

1835
00:53:20,065 --> 00:53:21,297
YEAH.

1836
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,032
HAVING MY AUNT
HERE TODAY REALLY

1837
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:23,967
HELPED GUIDE ME THROUGH

1838
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:26,402
EVERYTHING, 'CAUSE
I WAS FEELING

1839
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:27,704

00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:47,277
SHOCKING.

1902
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:47,978
I JUST AM REALLY
DISAPPOINTED IN

1903
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:48,545

00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:51,882
LIKE, I'M HAPPY
ABOUT TINO, BUT

1906
00:55:51,883 --> 00:55:53,149
NOW I'M, LIKE,
OBVIOUSLY NERVOUS

1907
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:53,750
THAT TINO ALSO ISN'T READY FOR

1908
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:55,585
AN ENGAGEMENT.

1909
00:55:55,586 --> 00:56:01,524
HI.

1910
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:02,392
HELLO!

1911
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:03,293
YOU LOOK SO PRETTY.

1912
00:56:03,294 --> 00:56:04,493
THANK YOU.

1913
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:04,995
YOU GUYS LOOK SO GREAT.

1914
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:05,662
I REALLY JUST HOPE ME AND

1915
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:06,330
TINO ARE ON THE
SAME PAGE STILL

1916
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:06,997
AND THAT HE
IMPRESSES MY FRIENDS

1917
00:56:06,998 --> 00:56:08,798
AND FAMILY.

1918
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,032
THEY SEE SOMETHING
I DON'T SEE,

1919
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,133
THEN I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING

1920
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:12,002
TO DO.

1921
00:56:12,003 --> 00:56:13,703
HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

1922
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,471
WELL, I'LL BE HONEST.

1923
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:19,242
I FEEL LIKE TODAY
IS JUST ONE OF

1924
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:19,877
THOSE DAYS WHERE
I'M JUST, LIKE,

1925
00:56:19,878 --> 00:56:21,878
NOT IN THE BEST MOOD.

1926
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,179
I REALLY FELT LIKE ME AND AVEN

1927
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,781
WERE ON THE SAME PAGE, SO IT'S

1928
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,583
JUST NOT HOW I
WANTED IT TO GO.

1929
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,585
I WANTED HIM TO
WALK IN AND FOR

1930
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:30,187
YOU ALL TO BE, LIKE, "THIS IS

1931
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:30,888
IT."

1932
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:31,755
SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT'S A

1933
00:56:31,756 --> 00:56:33,623
LITTLE FRUSTRATING.

1934
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:35,057
NOW TODAY I'M
LIKE "OKAY, WHAT'S

1935
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:35,425
GOING TO HAPPEN?

1936
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:37,493
WHAT'S GOING TO GO WRONG?"

1937
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:38,728
BUT I REALLY AM
EXCITED FOR YOU

1938
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,630
GUYS TO MEET TINO.

1939
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:42,899
HE GOT MY FIRST
IMPRESSION ROSE,

1940
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,369
AND I FELL FOR TINO REALLY

1941
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:46,570
EARLY.

1942
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:48,671
BUT TINO'S FAMILY DOESN'T LIKE

1943
00:56:48,672 --> 00:56:50,907
ME, REALLY.

1944
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:51,141
WHY?

1945
00:56:51,142 --> 00:56:52,208
DID THEY NOT UNDERSTAND YOU

1946
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:53,476
OR, LIKE, YOU, OR WAS IT THE

1947
00:56:53,477 --> 00:56:54,510
PROCESS?

1948
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,544
WHAT WAS THE HESITATION?

1949
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:56,413
I DON'T KNOW.

1950
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:59,382
I THINK THIS JUST WASN'T

1951
00:56:59,383 --> 00:56:59,983
SOMETHING THAT THEY EXPECTED.

1952
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:02,118
IS IT YOUR INTERPRETATION

1953
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:03,152
THAT THEY DON'T LIKE YOU?

1954
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:03,553
OR WHAT HAPPENED?

1955
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:04,787
WE CAN ASK HIM.

1956
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,155
HE'S ALSO A GROWN ADULT AND

1957
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:07,924
IF, LIKE, THIS
IS HIS DECISION,

1958
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:08,859
I'M SURE THEY'RE
GOING TO, LIKE,

1959
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,927
EVENTUALLY COME AROUND.

1960
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:12,595
BUT I THINK I'M
GOING TO GO GET

1961
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,530
HIM.

1962
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:15,731
SO I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1963
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:22,238
I'M REALLY EXCITED.

1964
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:23,439
RACHEL CAME AND NOT AS

1965
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,041
EXCITED, NOT GUSHING LIKE SHE

1966
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:24,808
WAS THE FIRST TIME, YOU KNOW,

1967
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:27,043
YESTERDAY.

1968
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:27,844
I THINK SHE'S WORRIED THAT

1969
00:57:27,845 --> 00:57:29,445
THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER

1970
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,680
ISSUE THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND

1971
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:31,148
AND SHE'S GOING TO BE

1972
00:57:31,149 --> 00:57:32,548
DISAPPOINTED AGAIN.

1973
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,784

00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,134
SO LET'S NOT JINX IT.

1986
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:57,640

1987
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:58,241

00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:26,403
SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY

2006
00:58:26,404 --> 00:58:29,605
IMPORTANT TO HER.

2007
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:31,507
SO, DO YOU
WANT TO TELL THEM

2008
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,610
ABOUT OUR STORY?

2009
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:38,214
YEAH, SO I RODE IN ON A

2010
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:40,249
FORKLIFT.

2011
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,151
PROBABLY THIS IS THE MOST

2012
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:43,686
NERVOUS I'VE BEEN SINCE.

2013
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:47,423
BUT SO, YOU KNOW, WE, UH, WE

2014
00:58:47,424 --> 00:58:48,858
KIND OF LIKE
CAUGHT EACH OTHER'S

2015
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:52,428
EYE REALLY EARLY.

2016
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:52,963
WHAT'S THE MOST SPECIAL

2017
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:53,597
MOMENT THAT YOU
TWO HAVE SHARED

2018
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:54,564
SO FAR?

2019
00:58:54,565 --> 00:58:55,965
I THINK OUR
DINNER, OUR LAST

2020
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:58,067
DINNER WHEN YOU
WERE ABLE TO BE

2021
00:58:58,068 --> 00:58:59,902
REALLY HONEST WITH ME AND YOU

2022
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:00,170
TOLD ME...

2023
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:00,871
OH, YEAH.

2024
00:59:00,872 --> 00:59:01,904
YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH ME.

2025
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:03,305
YEAH.

2026
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:06,008
I'M IN LOVE WITH
HER AND I CAN'T

2027
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:07,243
WAIT TILL YOU GUYS ALL GET TO

2028
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:08,211
KNOW ME A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

2029
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,112
US TOO.

2030
00:59:09,113 --> 00:59:11,047
ME TOO.

2031
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,148
WHEN HE FIRST
WALKED THROUGH

2032
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:13,916
THE DOOR, HE LOOKED NERVOUS.

2033
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,351
I COULD TELL HE
LOOKED NERVOUS.

2034
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:15,952
TINO, I WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO

2035
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:16,319
YOU.

2036
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,720
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

2037
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:18,655
LET'S GO.

2038
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:20,489
BUT AFTER THE CONVERSATION

2039
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:21,191
WITH AVEN YESTERDAY, I THOUGHT

2040
00:59:21,192 --> 00:59:23,059
IT WAS VERY
IMPORTANT FOR ME TO

2041
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,628
ASK WHERE HE STANDS.

2042
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:27,129
LET'S JUST HOPE THERE'S NO

2043
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:27,831
SURPRISES.

2044
00:59:27,832 --> 00:59:29,565
DO YOU THINK YOU GUYS HAVE

2045
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:29,966
ENOUGH IN COMMON?

2046
00:59:29,967 --> 00:59:32,101
YEAH.

2047
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:33,302
I MEAN, DO
YOU HAVE A LOT TO

2048
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,371
DO TOGETHER?

2049
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:36,906
YEAH, I MEAN, LIKE, I DON'T

2050
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:39,208
EXPECT HER TO GO SURF WITH ME.

2051
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:41,777
BUT YEAH, THE
FUN THING WILL BE

2052
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,412
WE'LL PICK UP THINGS TOGETHER.

2053
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,081
DID YOU EVER BRING A GIRL

2054
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,216
HOME BEFORE?

2055
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:48,051
YEAH, I MEAN, A COUPLE MET

2056
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:49,618
THEM BUT IT WAS, LIKE...

2057
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,120
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT MEANS A

2058
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:53,856
LOT TO HER TO HAVE FAMILY,

2059
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:54,558
ESPECIALLY WHO LIKES HER.

2060
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:57,626
DO YOU THINK YOUR FAMILY WOULD

2061
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,095
BE COMING MORE UNDERSTANDING

2062
00:59:59,096 --> 00:59:59,362
ABOUT IT?

2063
00:59:59,363 --> 01:00:01,097
ABSOLUTELY.

2064
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,232
I AM A MILLION
PERCENT CONFIDENT

2065
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:03,967
THEY'LL LOVE RACHEL,

2066
01:00:03,968 --> 01:00:05,000
'CAUSE I DO.

2067
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,769
SO THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

2068
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:07,270
NO.

2069
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,004
I KNOW.

2070
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:09,271
AND THAT'S ALL
THAT MATTERS, BUT

2071
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,340
I DO KNOW FAMILY DOES MAKE A

2072
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:11,641
DIFFERENCE.

2073
01:00:11,642 --> 01:00:12,808
IT CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS IN THE

2074
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:14,610
FUTURE, TOO, IF FAMILY DOESN'T

2075
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:15,945
LIKE SOMEBODY.

2076
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,680
SO IF YOU'RE CONFIDENT.

2077
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:19,615
RACHEL WANTS THE
OTHER FAMILY TO

2078
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,883
LIKE HER TOO.

2079
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:22,618
YOU KNOW, IF
FAMILIES LIKE EACH

2080
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,220
OTHER, IT'S GOING TO MAKE THE

2081
01:00:23,221 --> 01:00:25,020
MARRIAGE BETTER.

2082
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:26,856
AND HE KNOWS HIS DAD.

2083
01:00:26,857 --> 01:00:27,691
IF HE THINKS HIS
DAD'S GOING TO

2084
01:00:27,692 --> 01:00:30,326
ACCEPT HER, THEN
I FEEL BETTER.

2085
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:31,261
HE'S SUCCESSFUL, LOVES WHAT

2086
01:00:31,262 --> 01:00:32,928
HE DOES.

2087
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,330
DOES HE BUILD TOWNHOMES OR

2088
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:37,266
DOES HE BUILD SKYSCRAPERS?

2089
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:39,101
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

2090
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:39,736
LARGE BUILDINGS
GO FOR YEARS

2091
01:00:39,737 --> 01:00:44,073
AND YOU CAN'T WORK REMOTE WHEN

2092
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:45,241
YOU'RE BUILDING A BUILDING.

2093
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:45,842
RIGHT, I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT

2094
01:00:45,843 --> 01:00:47,176
YOU.

2095
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:48,044
AND YOUR DREAMS.

2096
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:49,278
SO IF YOU WANT TO WORK IN

2097
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:49,513
EUROPE.

2098
01:00:49,514 --> 01:00:51,981
YEAH, I MEAN, DEFINITELY.

2099
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:53,549
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I NEED TO DO

2100
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:54,850
THAT RIGHT NOW IF IT DOESN'T

2101
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,385
WORK OUT, HE WANTS TO TRAVEL.

2102
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:58,387
HE LIVES A VERY INTERESTING

2103
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,789
LIFE, FROM WHAT YOU TOLD US.

2104
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:03,325
AND THAT'S GOT TO BE EXCITING.

2105
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,060
AND I KNOW THAT'S THE WAY YOU

2106
01:01:04,061 --> 01:01:05,161
LIVE LIFE.

2107
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:07,463
YEAH, HE HAS
ALL THESE CRAZY

2108
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:08,797
HOBBIES AND HE WANTS TO DO ALL

2109
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:11,200
THESE THINGS, AND IT MAKES ME,

2110
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:12,035
LIKE, WELL, I
WANT TO BE A PART

2111
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:13,003
OF THAT AND I WANT TO DO THAT

2112
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:13,970
CHARITY WORK WITH YOU AND I

2113
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:15,738
WOULD LOVE TO
LEARN HOW TO SURF

2114
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:17,606
AND LIVE IN THAT
BEACH TOWN WITH

2115
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:19,141
YOU.

2116
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:19,743
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE FUN IN

2117
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,410
LIFE.

2118
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:21,278
LIFE GOES REALLY QUICK.

2119
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,445
YEAH.

2120
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:24,480
I'M EXCITED FOR YOU

2121
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:25,282
TO TALK TO HIM.

2122
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:25,916
I'M EXCITED
TO SPEAK WITH HIM

2123
01:01:25,917 --> 01:01:27,116
ALSO.

2124
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:28,717
WHEN SHE DESCRIBED TINO,

2125
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:30,219
SHE DESCRIBED HIM WITH SUCH

2126
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,521
ENTHUSIASM.

2127
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,424
AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE MY

2128
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:36,259
DAUGHTER THAT HAPPY,

2129
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,459
BUT I'M A FATHER.

2130
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,361
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR WHAT'S

2131
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:39,796
HAPPENING TOMORROW.

2132
01:01:39,797 --> 01:01:41,263
I'M MORE CONCERNED TO SEE WHAT

2133
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:44,667
THEIR FUTURE IS GOING TO BE.

2134
01:01:44,668 --> 01:01:45,235
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?

2135
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:46,136
I'M DOING PRETTY GOOD.

2136
01:01:46,137 --> 01:01:47,803
YOU KNOW, LET'S
GET RIGHT AT IT.

2137
01:01:48,673 --> 01:01:51,373
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

2138
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,142
HOMETOWN.

2139
01:01:52,143 --> 01:01:53,742
WHAT HAPPENED
THERE THAT CHANGED

2140
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:56,378
HER MIND OR...

2141
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:59,048
MADE HER FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE?

2142
01:01:59,049 --> 01:01:59,616
YEAH, I HOPE SHE DIDN'T

2143
01:01:59,617 --> 01:02:02,384
CHANGE HER MIND.

2144
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,485
SO HOMETOWN WAS A LITTLE

2145
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:05,354
SURPRISING TO ME TOO.

2146
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:06,855
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, ALL I

2147
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:07,424
TALK ABOUT WITH MY DAD IS

2148
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:08,225
SPORTS.

2149
01:02:08,226 --> 01:02:10,059
SO IT WAS REALLY SHOCKING.

2150
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,962
BUT I AM 100%
SURE THAT IF THEY

2151
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,897
GET A DAY WITH HER WHERE WE GO

2152
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:15,832
TO THE BEACH, THEY'LL, LIKE,

2153
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:18,234
FALL IN LOVE WITH
HER JUST LIKE

2154
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:20,102
I DID.

2155
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:22,972
SHE'LL HAVE A JOB THAT SHE

2156
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:24,306
COULD LIVE IN
CALIFORNIA AND BE

2157
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:26,675
WORKING OUT OF ATLANTA.

2158
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:27,776
BUT YOU AREN'T AS MOBILE

2159
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:29,278
AS SHE IS.

2160
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:33,282
IS THAT GOING TO BE A PROBLEM?

2161
01:02:33,283 --> 01:02:34,683
IF SHE WANTED
TO GO, I DON'T

2162
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:36,619
KNOW, LIKE TO A
FOREIGN COUNTRY,

2163
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,320
I WOULD JUST SAY
OKAY, "WE NEED

2164
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:39,989
AT LEAST A COUPLE
YEARS SO I CAN

2165
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,057
BE ON THE BUILDING."

2166
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:42,292
GOOD.

2167
01:02:42,293 --> 01:02:43,359
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SHE IS THAT

2168
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,827
ADVENTUROUS TYPE, AND SHE

2169
01:02:44,828 --> 01:02:47,429
EXPLAINED ABOUT YOU BEING THE

2170
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,498
SAME TYPE OF PERSON.

2171
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:52,301
IN THE MOST
GENUINE WAY I CAN

2172
01:02:52,302 --> 01:02:54,203
PUT IT, I MEAN, YOUR DAUGHTER

2173
01:02:54,204 --> 01:02:55,537
DOES MEAN THE WORLD TO ME.

2174
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,606
LIFE IS HARD, BUT I WANT TO BE

2175
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,941
THAT PERSON WHO
IS SHARING THAT

2176
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:03,379
BURDEN WITH HER AND THERE TO

2177
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,014
EXPERIENCE THE
AMAZINGNESS THAT

2178
01:03:04,015 --> 01:03:06,015
WE BRING TO EACH OTHER.

2179
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:06,750
I'M GOING TO MAKE
YOUR DAUGHTER

2180
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,284
HAPPY FOREVER.

2181
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:11,353
WELL, I DO LIKE YOU.

2182
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:14,223
I DO LIKE YOU.

2183
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:15,424
I AM A LITTLE BIT IN AWE OF

2184
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:18,127
HOW WELL MEETING
RACHEL'S FAMILY

2185
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:18,395
JUST WENT.

2186
01:03:18,396 --> 01:03:19,396
SERIOUSLY, THANK YOU GUYS

2187
01:03:19,397 --> 01:03:21,597
SO MUCH.

2188
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:24,300
I'M KIND OF REALLY
FEELING LIKE

2189
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:27,569
WHAT I'VE WANTED FOR WEEKS NOW

2190
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:28,338
IS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN.

2191
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:29,205
NICE MEETING YOU.

2192
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:29,839
ABSOLUTELY.

2193
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,940
SO NICE MEETING YOU.

2194
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:35,377
BYE, GUYS.

2195
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:36,378
TODAY WENT BETTER THAN I

2196
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:38,447
THOUGHT IT COULD'VE WENT.

2197
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:39,715
BIG STAMP OF APPROVAL FROM

2198
01:03:39,716 --> 01:03:41,684
EVERYONE.

2199
01:03:41,685 --> 01:03:43,018
NOW WE JUST HAVE TO WORK

2200
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:43,853
ON YOUR FAMILY.

2201
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:46,322
THEY WILL LIKE YOU.

2202
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:51,060
YOU'VE ALREADY
GOT THE APPROVAL

2203
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:52,261
THE IMPORTANT ONE.

2204
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:53,362
AND THE REST WILL FOLLOW SOON.

2205
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:55,431
AND I REALLY
DO FEEL LIKE HE

2206
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:56,632
DOES WANT A LIFE WITH ME BUT I

2207
01:03:56,633 --> 01:03:57,233
DON'T KNOW HOW TO, LIKE, THINK

2208
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:57,801
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

2209
01:03:57,802 --> 01:04:01,837
NEXT.

2210
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:02,005
BYE.

2211
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:02,839
BECAUSE I STILL HAVE TO HAVE A

2212
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:03,440
DISCUSSION WITH AVEN.

2213
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,207
HE'S SOMEONE I
REALLY CARE ABOUT

2214
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:06,275
TOO AND I KNOW
HE PROBABLY ISN'T

2215
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:06,910
FEELING GOOD RIGHT NOW.

2216
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,243
I THINK HE'S PROBABLY, LIKE,

2217
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:09,278
WAITING UNTIL HE GETS A CHANCE

2218
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:11,380
TO EXPLAI THINGS TO ME AGAIN

2219
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:13,382
AND THIS REALLY HARD

2220
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:16,552
CONVERSATION HAS TO HAPPEN.

2221
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:18,153
SO YEAH, I JUST
HAVE TO TAKE IT

2222
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:19,789
ONE STEP AT A TIME RIGHT NOW.

2223
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:36,806
WE ARE BACK.

2224
01:04:36,807 --> 01:04:38,440
WE ARE LIVE.

2225
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:39,675
AND YOU ARE
WATCHING THE HIGHLY

2226
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:43,879
CHARGED "BACHELORETTE" FINALE.

2227
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:48,784
TWITTER RIGHT NOW IS ON FIRE.

2228
01:04:48,785 --> 01:04:51,353
SOME FOLKS ARE TEAM RACHEL.

2229
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:52,621
SO MARTIN AVEN.

2230
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:55,357
SUMMER TEAM GABBY AND EVERYONE

2231
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:57,826
IS TEAM GRANDPA JOHN.

2232
01:04:57,827 --> 01:05:00,996
I AM NOT SURE IF GRANDPA JOHN

2233
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:02,231
GETS DMs.

2234
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,868
BUT IF HE DOES, LOOK OUT.

2235
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:08,404
I WANT TO CIRCLE
BACK WITH YOU.

2236
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:11,206
I WANT TO GO BACK
TO THAT REALLY

2237
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:12,674
INTENSE CONVERSATION YOU HAD

2238
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:13,842
WITH AVEN WHEN HE TOLD HIM HE

2239
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,844
WASN'T SURE IF HE COULD SEE

2240
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:17,513
HIMSELF GETTING ENGAGED YOU AT

2241
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:19,314
THE END OF ALL THIS AND

2242
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:20,183
UNDERSTANDABLY
WAS VERY SHOCKING

2243
01:05:20,184 --> 01:05:23,619
TO YOU.

2244
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,487
WHAT ABOUT THAT
MOMENT MADE YOU

2245
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:25,922
SO UPSET?

2246
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:26,489
WALKING IN, ALL I REALLY

2247
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:30,626
WANTED FOR US TO
BE ON THE SAME

2248
01:05:30,627 --> 01:05:32,227
PAGE AND TO REALIZE WE WEREN'T

2249
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:33,196
WAS REALLY THE
HARDEST THING FOR

2250
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:33,930
ME.

2251
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:35,564
GOING INTO
THAT FINAL NIGHT,

2252
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:36,665
WHAT WERE YOU HOPING FOR?

2253
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:39,368
WHAT DOOMED TO HEAR FROM HIM?

2254
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:41,503
I DON'T KNOW
IF I NECESSARILY

2255
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:42,005
NEEDED TO HEAR ANYTHING.

2256
01:05:42,006 --> 01:05:44,873
I JUST NEEDED TO
THE SEE ACTIONS

2257
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:46,842
WITH WHAT HE TOLD ME BEFORE.

2258
01:05:46,843 --> 01:05:48,043
IT SEEMS LIKE AT THIS POINT

2259
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:51,447
THE RELATIONSHIP IS ON ROCKY

2260
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:52,182
GROUND.

2261
01:05:52,183 --> 01:05:56,418
MAYBE REACHING THE BREAKING

2262
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:57,586
POINT.

2263
01:05:57,587 --> 01:05:58,787
AVEN HAS ONE LAST SHOT.

2264
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,023
IS HE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TURN

2265
01:06:01,024 --> 01:06:02,291
THINGS AROUND WITH RACHEL?

2266
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:10,292
LET'S FIND OUT.

2267
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:11,868
TONIGHT IS MY LAST DATE

2268
01:06:11,869 --> 01:06:14,636
WITH AVEN.

2269
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,572
AND I AM EXTREMELY NERVOUS

2270
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:18,674
TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

2271
01:06:18,675 --> 01:06:22,244
BECAUSE I WAS SO CONFIDENT

2272
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:24,746
IN AVEN, AND WE HAD A FULL

2273
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:27,583
OVERNIGHT DATE TOGETHER WHERE

2274
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:29,117
AVEN TOLD ME HE IS 100% READY

2275
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:31,687
FOR AN ENGAGEMENT.

2276
01:06:31,688 --> 01:06:32,888
BUT WHEN HE TALKED
TO MY FAMILY,

2277
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:34,022
HE TOLD THEM SOMETHING

2278
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:38,560
DIFFERENT.

2279
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:39,462
AND THERE WAS A POINT WHERE I

2280
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:41,597
WAS, LIKE, I SEE MY LIFE WITH

2281
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:41,798
AVEN.

2282
01:06:41,799 --> 01:06:46,268
LIKE, AVEN IS IT.

2283
01:06:46,537 --> 01:06:50,239
SO I NEED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT

2284
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:50,940
WHETHER OR NOT
WE ARE COMPLETELY

2285
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:58,480
ON THE SAME PAGE.

2286
01:06:58,481 --> 01:06:59,315
HI, BEAUTIFUL.

2287
01:06:59,316 --> 01:07:00,782
HI.

2288
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:01,950
HOW ARE YOU?

2289
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,085
I'M GOOD.

2290
01:07:03,086 --> 01:07:05,754
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

2291
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:06,256
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

2292
01:07:06,257 --> 01:07:08,524
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

2293
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,692
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

2294
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,829
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

2295
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:14,163
DOING OKAY.

2296
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:18,634
I REALLY MISSED YOU.

2297
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:20,435
I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

2298
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:21,004
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO

2299
01:07:21,005 --> 01:07:23,138
TODAY, AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

2300
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:23,940
SOME STUFF THAT I WANT TO TALK

2301
01:07:23,941 --> 01:07:26,742
TO YOU ABOUT.

2302
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:27,943
BUT, LIKE, BEFORE KIND OF

2303
01:07:27,944 --> 01:07:29,111
GETTING INTO IT, DO YOU WANT A

2304
01:07:29,112 --> 01:07:30,679
GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE?

2305
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,813
LET'S JUST...

2306
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:32,814
DO YOU WANT TO JUST TALK?

2307
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:33,550
I JUST FEEL LIKE WE NEED...

2308
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:34,816
YOU WANT TO...

2309
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:35,084
YEAH.

2310
01:07:35,085 --> 01:07:37,786
ABSOLUTELY.

2311
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:40,689
WELL, I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT

2312
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,424
THESE LAST COUPLE DAYS FOR ME

2313
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:46,128
HAVE BEEN REALLY HARD.

2314
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:47,930
JUST FROM THE PURE FACT OF,

2315
01:07:47,931 --> 01:07:49,197
LIKE, HOW I SAW YOU THE OTHER

2316
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:51,099
DAY WHEN WE HAD
A CONVERSATION.

2317
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,101
I AM SO, LIKE, DEEPLY SORRY

2318
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:55,671
ABOUT MAKING YOU
FEEL LIKE THAT.

2319
01:07:55,672 --> 01:07:56,339
IT REALLY KILLED ME TO SEE YOU

2320
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,973
LIKE THAT.

2321
01:07:57,974 --> 01:07:59,541
I NEVER WANT TO BE THE REASON

2322
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:01,643
WHY YOU CRY OR ARE UPSET OVER

2323
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:03,312
ANYTHING.

2324
01:08:03,313 --> 01:08:05,881
IT REALLY CRUSHED ME.

2325
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:08,550
AND I KNOW A LOT OF IT IS

2326
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:11,753
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT
HAVE FELT THAT

2327
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,423
THAT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, AND

2328
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:15,924
I'M TRULY SORRY ABOUT THAT.

2329
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,360
AND THE NEXT STEP
IN ALL OF THIS

2330
01:08:18,361 --> 01:08:19,062
IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME

2331
01:08:19,063 --> 01:08:22,564
BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT YOU.

2332
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:25,933
BUT YOU KNOW, REALIZING THAT I

2333
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:29,538
WANT MORE TIME WITH YOU AND I

2334
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:31,306
WANT TO COME VISIT YOU IN

2335
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:32,574
FLORIDA AND SEE
WHERE YOU LIVE.

2336
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:33,142
I WANT YOU TO COME VISIT ME.

2337
01:08:33,143 --> 01:08:35,377
I WANT TO DO LIFE OUTSIDE OF

2338
01:08:35,378 --> 01:08:35,978
THIS WITH YOU, AND I JUST FEEL

2339
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:37,111
LIKE THAT'S SO
IMPORTANT FOR US

2340
01:08:37,112 --> 01:08:39,147
AT THIS POINT BEFORE THAT NEXT

2341
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:43,050
STEP, AND I WANT
US TO BE FULLY,

2342
01:08:43,051 --> 01:08:46,120
FULLY IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.

2343
01:08:46,121 --> 01:08:47,923
SO THAT'S THAT
POINT WHEN WE GET

2344
01:08:47,924 --> 01:08:48,591
HERE IS SO SPECIAL
FOR US AND WE

2345
01:08:48,592 --> 01:08:49,891
CAN GO RIGHT INTO
A MARRIAGE AND

2346
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:53,461
START OUR FAMILY TOGETHER WITH

2347
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,030
OUR KIDS, OUR TWO OR FOUR,

2348
01:08:55,031 --> 01:08:55,497
HOWEVER MANY YOU WANT.

2349
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:58,700
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE SO FAR?

2350
01:08:58,701 --> 01:08:59,335
YEAH.

2351
01:08:59,336 --> 01:09:03,371
I THINK...

2352
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:05,475
I'M SORRY.

2353
01:09:05,476 --> 01:09:08,209
I'M JUST, LIKE, STRUGGLING.

2354
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:11,313
LIKE, I HATE THE WAY WE LEFT

2355
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:13,115
THINGS REALLY.

2356
01:09:13,116 --> 01:09:14,683
AND I NEED YOU
TO KNOW I HAVEN'T

2357
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:16,618
STOPPED, LIKE, THINKING ABOUT,

2358
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:19,655
LIKE, HOW THINGS WERE LEFT.

2359
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:21,389
AND, LIKE, I NEED YOU TO KNOW,

2360
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:24,959
LIKE, HOW HARD
IT IS FOR ME TO,

2361
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:30,132
LIKE, WALK IN TO MY FAMILY AND

2362
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:33,067
BE, LIKE...

2363
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:35,736
WHEN AVEN SAYS
SOMETHING TO ME,

2364
01:09:35,737 --> 01:09:38,607
HE MEANS IT AND
HE WOULD NEVER,

2365
01:09:38,608 --> 01:09:40,842
LIKE, LIE TO ME.

2366
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,545
AND I THINK THE ONE THING I

2367
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:45,047
WANTED OUT OF
THIS WAS WHEN YOU

2368
01:09:45,048 --> 01:09:50,686
SAT DOWN WITH MY
FAMILY THAT WE

2369
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,654
WERE ON THE SAME PAGE.

2370
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:56,290
AND I FEEL SO
BLINDSIDED BY YOU,

2371
01:09:56,291 --> 01:09:58,860
LIKE, I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU.

2372
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,028
WHEN I SAT DOWN WITH SAM AND

2373
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,297
NATE AND THEY LOOKED AT ME AND

2374
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:03,166
SAID "YOU DON'T
KNOW WHERE HE'S

2375
01:10:03,167 --> 01:10:04,533
AT RIGHT NOW," DO YOU KNOW HOW

2376
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:07,803
THAT FELT TO ME?

2377
01:10:07,804 --> 01:10:10,072
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
WHEN WE TALKED

2378
01:10:10,073 --> 01:10:11,272
THAT NIGHT THAT WE WERE ON THE

2379
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:19,273
SAME PAGE.

2380
01:10:19,514 --> 01:10:22,384
I REALLY, LIKE, I THINK A

2381
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:23,618
PART OF YOU IS THINKING THAT I

2382
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:26,388
DON'T WANT THIS ANYMORE, AND

2383
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:28,623
THAT IS 1000% NOT THE CASE.

2384
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:31,526
I WANT TO LEAVE HERE WITH YOU.

2385
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:33,261
I WANT THAT MORE
THAN ANYTHING.

2386
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,896
AND I'M SITTING HERE TRYING TO

2387
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:38,600
FIGHT FOR IT.

2388
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:39,568
AND I KNOW THAT I MIGHT HAVE

2389
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:42,370
BEEN...

2390
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:44,106
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT IS, CAUGHT

2391
01:10:44,107 --> 01:10:46,040
UP A LITTLE BIT IN SOME OF IT.

2392
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,209
CAUGHT UP?

2393
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,077
NOT IN A BAD WAY, RACHEL.

2394
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:49,644
NOT IN A BAD WAY.

2395
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:50,645
I DON'T WANT THAT TO COME OFF

2396
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:53,115
IN A BAD WAY.

2397
01:10:53,116 --> 01:10:53,983
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,

2398
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:54,282
"CAUGHT UP"?

2399
01:10:54,282 --> 01:10:54,884
IN SAYING THAT I THOUGHT I

2400
01:10:54,884 --> 01:10:55,684
MIGHT'VE BEEN
READY FOR THIS IN

2401
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:56,685
TWO WEEKS.

2402
01:10:56,686 --> 01:10:57,653
BUT I'M TELLING YOU THAT MY

2403
01:10:57,654 --> 01:10:59,454
FEELINGS TOWARDS YOU HAVE NOT

2404
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:00,123
CHANGED AT ALL,
AND A LIFE AFTER

2405
01:11:00,124 --> 01:11:01,623
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I WANT

2406
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:09,624
WITH YOU.

2407
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,869
IT REALLY HURTS TO HEAR YOU

2408
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:15,003
TELL ME ONE THING AND THEN SAY

2409
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:17,105
YOU GOT CAUGHT
UP IN IT WITH ME.

2410
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,473
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR IT...

2411
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:19,941
BUT I THINK
YOU NEED TO KNOW

2412
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,676
THAT, LIKE, LIKE, I WANT TO BE

2413
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:23,477
ENGAGED.

2414
01:11:23,478 --> 01:11:26,147
I WANT SOMEONE
WHO'S SURE ABOUT

2415
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:27,749
ME AND, LIKE, I'M
NOT WILLING TO

2416
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:31,386
SACRIFICE THAT
AT THE END OF THE

2417
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:32,721
DAY.

2418
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:33,623
AND I'M HAVING
SUCH A HARD TIME

2419
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:36,258
BECAUSE, LIKE,
I FEEL LIKE FROM

2420
01:11:36,259 --> 01:11:37,893
THE BEGINNING, I'VE SEEN THIS,

2421
01:11:37,894 --> 01:11:42,364
LIKE, WITH...

2422
01:11:42,365 --> 01:11:43,965
LIKE I CAN SEE THIS LIFE WITH

2423
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,834
YOU OUTSIDE OF THIS AND I FEEL

2424
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:47,334
LIKE IF THIS WAS ANY OTHER

2425
01:11:47,335 --> 01:11:50,872
SITUATION THAT IT WOULD BE ME

2426
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,308
AND YOU OUTSIDE OF THIS.

2427
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,376
BUT I'M JUST NOT WILLING TO

2428
01:11:54,377 --> 01:11:56,845
SACRIFICE THAT.

2429
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:58,180
LIKE, I NEED
SOMEONE WHO IS SURE

2430
01:11:58,181 --> 01:11:58,948
ABOUT ME AND YOU'RE NOT SURE

2431
01:11:58,948 --> 01:11:59,816
ABOUT ME.

2432
01:11:59,817 --> 01:12:03,051
I AM SURE ABOUT YOU.

2433
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:04,852
BUT I FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T

2434
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:07,088
GIVE ME WHAT I NEED RIGHT NOW.

2435
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:07,723
I WANT TO GIVE THAT TO YOU.

2436
01:12:07,724 --> 01:12:13,261
AVEN, YOU CAN'T, THOUGH.

2437
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:14,963
LIKE, I ULTIMATELY FEEL LIKE I

2438
01:12:14,964 --> 01:12:18,533
JUST CAN'T, LIKE,
I CAN'T, LIKE,

2439
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:21,536
MOVE FORWARD.

2440
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:26,808
IT'S OVER.

2441
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:34,809
OH.

2442
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:44,959
I'M SO...

2443
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,261
RACHEL.

2444
01:12:46,262 --> 01:12:47,963
I'M SITTING HERE TELLING YOU

2445
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:50,932
THAT I...

2446
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:56,438
LIKE, I'M
NEVER GOING TO GET

2447
01:12:56,439 --> 01:13:02,843
OVER THIS.

2448
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:17,993
THIS...

2449
01:13:17,994 --> 01:13:18,661
I DID NOT INTEND FOR THIS

2450
01:13:18,662 --> 01:13:20,161
TO HAPPEN AT ALL.

2451
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:21,030
I'M SO SORRY.

2452
01:13:21,031 --> 01:13:22,230
I JUST FEEL LIKE MY HEART IS,

2453
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,299
LIKE, BREAKING RIGHT NOW.

2454
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:30,038
LIKE...

2455
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:38,039
I'M SORRY.

2456
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:42,049
I JUST WANT
YOU TO BE HAPPY.

2457
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:42,652
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY

2458
01:13:42,653 --> 01:13:50,125
IN ALL OF THIS.

2459
01:13:50,126 --> 01:13:51,027
CAN I GIVE YOU A HUG?

2460
01:13:51,028 --> 01:13:54,396
YEAH.

2461
01:13:54,397 --> 01:13:58,633
I'M SO SORRY, RACHEL.

2462
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:03,204
DO YOU WANT TO WALK ME OUT?

2463
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:10,712
I FAILED.

2464
01:14:10,713 --> 01:14:15,049
BYE.

2465
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:15,851
I'M SO SORRY.

2466
01:14:15,852 --> 01:14:23,852
I'M SORRY.

2467
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:32,834
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE I'M

2468
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:33,902
GOING FROM HERE
BECAUSE I DIDN'T

2469
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:34,804
THINK I WAS GOING
TO BE LEAVING

2470
01:14:34,805 --> 01:14:42,805
HERE WITHOUT RACHEL.

2471
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:48,083
I SAW A LIFE WITH HER.

2472
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:50,819
AND I WILL ALWAYS
THINK THAT IF

2473
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,887
I DID SOMETHING DIFFERENT,

2474
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:53,621
THINGS WOULD HAVE
BEEN DIFFERENT

2475
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:56,524
WITH US.

2476
01:14:56,525 --> 01:15:04,525
FOREVER.

2477
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:12,607
I'M UPSET THAT I WASN'T THERE.

2478
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:14,876
I KNOW THAT WE
WOULD HAVE GOTTEN

2479
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:22,877
THERE.

2480
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:27,388
IT'S JUST
REALLY SAD BECAUSE

2481
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:30,592
IT'S JUST, LIKE, HARD TO KNOW

2482
01:15:30,593 --> 01:15:38,593
IT'S OVER.

2483
01:15:50,813 --> 01:15:51,980
I DID SEE IT BEING HIM AND I

2484
01:15:51,981 --> 01:15:59,981
AT THE END.

2485
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:04,994
I'M HAVING TOO MANY OF THESE

2486
01:16:04,995 --> 01:16:07,729
MOMENTS.

2487
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:08,997
LIKE, HOW MUCH LONGER CAN I GO

2488
01:16:08,998 --> 01:16:15,504
ON THIS ROLLER COASTER?

2489
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:30,285
RACHEL, I'M SORRY.

2490
01:16:30,286 --> 01:16:34,055
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

2491
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:35,390
THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY COMPLETELY,

2492
01:16:35,391 --> 01:16:36,491
COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED.

2493
01:16:36,492 --> 01:16:38,093
I WAS WATCHING YOU WATCH THAT

2494
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:40,195
BACK AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE

2495
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:41,930
STILL TRYING TO PROCESS

2496
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:42,764
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

2497
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:43,632
YEAH.

2498
01:16:43,633 --> 01:16:44,833
I THINK THERE'S
REALLY NO WORDS

2499
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:48,436
TO DESCRIBE IT.

2500
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,205
IT'S OBVIOUSLY HURTS TO WATCH

2501
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:50,439
BACK.

2502
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,638
IT STILL FEELS
THAT WAY WATCHING

2503
01:16:51,639 --> 01:16:53,074
IT BACK AGAIN.

2504
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:54,609
I KNOW THIS WHOLE THING IS

2505
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,977
BEEN SUITABLY
EMOTIONAL FOR YOU

2506
01:16:56,978 --> 01:16:57,246
OBVIOUSLY.

2507
01:16:57,247 --> 01:16:58,745
THAT MIGHT'VE BEEN THE MOST

2508
01:16:58,746 --> 01:16:59,881
EMOTION THAT WE
SAW FROM YOU ON

2509
01:16:59,882 --> 01:17:00,216
THIS JOURNEY.

2510
01:17:00,217 --> 01:17:02,183
WHEREDO YOU THINK THAT WAS ALL

2511
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:03,152
COMING FROM?

2512
01:17:03,153 --> 01:17:05,986
I MEAN,
EVERYTHING I SAID IS

2513
01:17:05,987 --> 01:17:07,088
EXACTLY, LIKE, WHAT I WAS

2514
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:07,990
FEELING.

2515
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:08,724
I REALLY DID SEE HIM AND I AT

2516
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:10,692
THE END OF IT SO IT WAS REALLY

2517
01:17:10,693 --> 01:17:11,327
HARD TO SAY GOODBYE.

2518
01:17:11,328 --> 01:17:15,196
I CAN SEE THE
EMOTION ON YOUR

2519
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:15,397
FACE.

2520
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:16,731
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE
FIGHTING BACK

2521
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,633
TEARS.

2522
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,868
IS THAT TRUE?

2523
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:21,302
IS THAT HOW YOU FEEL?

2524
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:24,272
I'M ALWAYS FIGHTING BACK

2525
01:17:24,273 --> 01:17:25,141
TEARS, JESSE.

2526
01:17:25,142 --> 01:17:26,574
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

2527
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:29,010
GABBY, YOU'VE
BEEN SUPPORTING

2528
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:30,678
EACH OTHER ON THIS ENTIRE

2529
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:30,913
JOURNEY.

2530
01:17:30,914 --> 01:17:32,046
I KNOW HOW YOU BEEN SUPPORTING

2531
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:32,748
EACH OTHER.

2532
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:35,016
HOW EMOTIONAL WAS IT FOR USING

2533
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:36,183
RACHEL GO THROUGH ALL THIS?

2534
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:38,520
IT'S DEVASTATING
JUST KNOWING

2535
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:41,589
HOW MUCH YOU WENT THROUGH.

2536
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,892
AND BEING A GOOD FRIEND, MY

2537
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:46,895
HEART HURTS WHEN HERS DOES.

2538
01:17:46,896 --> 01:17:49,397
NONE OF THIS IS REALLY EASY.

2539
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:51,132
AVEN IS HERE.

2540
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:52,834
HE'S BACKSTAGE.

2541
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:54,135
DO YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE READY TO

2542
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:56,704
TALK TO HIM AND
HEAR WHAT HE HAS

2543
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:57,939
TO SAY?

2544
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:58,407
YEAH.

2545
01:17:58,408 --> 01:18:00,608
WE'LL DO THAT.

2546
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:02,043
WHEN WE COME BACK, RACHEL AND

2547
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:03,012
AVEN WILL GO FACE
-TO-FACE IS THE

2548
01:18:03,013 --> 01:18:04,946
FIRST TIME THEY BROKE UP IN

2549
01:18:04,947 --> 01:18:06,448
MEXICO.

2550
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:29,070
WELCOME BACK TO THE LIVE

2551
01:18:29,071 --> 01:18:31,272
FINALE OF THE BACHELORETTE.

2552
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:33,808
THIS ENTIRE JOURNEY HAS BEEN A

2553
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:34,643
MASSIVE ROLLER COASTER.

2554
01:18:34,644 --> 01:18:35,843
OBVIOUSLY TONIGHT IS NO

2555
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:36,111
DIFFERENT.

2556
01:18:36,112 --> 01:18:39,013
WE ARE AT THAT POINT NOW.

2557
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:40,281
EVERYONE HAS JUST WATCHED YOU

2558
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:41,950
END THINGS WITH AVEN.

2559
01:18:41,951 --> 01:18:43,985
ARE YOU READY TO SEE HIM?

2560
01:18:43,986 --> 01:18:45,453
I AM CHECKING BECAUSE YOU SEEM

2561
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:47,088
NERVOUS.

2562
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:47,990
ARE YOU SURE?

2563
01:18:47,991 --> 01:18:49,824
YEAH.

2564
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:51,125
ALL RIGHT, LADIES AND

2565
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:59,126
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE
WELCOME AVEN.

2566
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:03,605
HOW ARE YOU?

2567
01:19:03,606 --> 01:19:04,406
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

2568
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:10,178
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

2569
01:19:10,179 --> 01:19:11,946
RACHEL AND AVEN, IT'S GREAT

2570
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:13,013
SEEING YOU BOTH BACK HERE

2571
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:13,282
TOGETHER.

2572
01:19:13,283 --> 01:19:15,583
I WILL START WITH YOU, RACHEL.

2573
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:18,218
WHAT'S IT LIKE SEEING AVEN FOR

2574
01:19:18,219 --> 01:19:19,121
THE FIRST TIME
SINCE THAT DAY IN

2575
01:19:19,122 --> 01:19:20,221
MEXICO?

2576
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:21,556
IT'S REALLY BITTERSWEET

2577
01:19:21,557 --> 01:19:22,757
OBVIOUSLY BUT IT'S REALLY GOOD

2578
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:23,058
TO SEE YOU.

2579
01:19:23,059 --> 01:19:26,060
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO

2580
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:27,227
PITTSBURGH I'M
SURE YOU'VE GOT A

2581
01:19:27,228 --> 01:19:27,730
LOT ON YOUR MIND.

2582
01:19:27,731 --> 01:19:29,497
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO

2583
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:29,732
RACHEL?

2584
01:19:29,733 --> 01:19:30,999
YEAH.

2585
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,334
I'LL MISS SAM'S
SO NERVOUS RIGHT

2586
01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:33,502
NOW.

2587
01:19:33,503 --> 01:19:35,937
I'VE BEEN VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE

2588
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:37,171
YOU.

2589
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:38,539
I THINK ONE THING
THAT I WANT TO

2590
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:41,009
SAY IS I'M
EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY

2591
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:41,577
SORRY THE WAY THINGS ENDED

2592
01:19:41,578 --> 01:19:46,114
BETWEEN US.

2593
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,915
I KNOW THAT I HURT YOU.

2594
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:50,251
THE WAY THAT THINGS KIND OF

2595
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:52,086
TRANSPIRED, I BLINDSIDED YOU

2596
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:54,455
WITH EVERYTHING THAT WASN'T

2597
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:54,657
FAIR.

2598
01:19:54,658 --> 01:19:56,991
I CARED ABOUT YOU
TOO MUCH TO DO

2599
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:57,960
THAT TO YOU.

2600
01:19:57,961 --> 01:19:59,593
SO I KNOW I
DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE

2601
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:01,763
I LET YOU DOWN IN THAT MOMENT.

2602
01:20:01,764 --> 01:20:02,531
I'M TRULY SORRY.

2603
01:20:02,532 --> 01:20:04,799
THAT'S THE FIRST
THING I WANTED

2604
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,200
TO SAY.

2605
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:07,935
RACHEL, WAS THERE ANYTHING

2606
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:09,437
AVEN COULD HAVE
SAID OR DONE TO

2607
01:20:09,438 --> 01:20:11,406
SALVAGE THE RELATIONSHIP THAT

2608
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:12,740
NIGHT WHEN YOU SAW HIM?

2609
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:15,977
IT'S HARD BECAUSE IT'S NOT

2610
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:17,078
LIKE ANYTHING WENT WRONG.

2611
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:19,013
WE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM.

2612
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:20,715
AT THE END OF
THE DAY, YOU JUST

2613
01:20:20,716 --> 01:20:22,984
KNEW WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR YOU.

2614
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:23,585
AND THAT'S OKAY.

2615
01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:26,287
I DON'T KNOW IF
THERE'S ANYTHING

2616
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:27,121
WE COULD HAVE DONE TO SALVAGE

2617
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:27,289
IT.

2618
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:28,790
WE WERE BEING TRUE TO HOW WE

2619
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:31,259
FELT IN THE MOMENT
AND I RESPECT

2620
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:31,827
THAT.

2621
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:34,128
YOU ARE ABLE TO BE HONEST WITH

2622
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:34,563
ME.

2623
01:20:34,564 --> 01:20:35,629
ABSOLUTELY.

2624
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:39,767
I THINK A BIG
PART OF IT TOO IS

2625
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:40,402
I JUST DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND

2626
01:20:40,403 --> 01:20:42,437
WHAT YOU NEEDED AND WHAT YOU

2627
01:20:42,438 --> 01:20:42,671
WANTED.

2628
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:43,072
THAT WAS ON ME.

2629
01:20:43,073 --> 01:20:46,841
THAT WAS MY FAULT.

2630
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:47,643
AGAIN, I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

2631
01:20:47,644 --> 01:20:49,477
AS FAR AS SALVAGING
IT, I DON'T

2632
01:20:49,478 --> 01:20:50,745
KNOW IF WE COULD HAVE OR NOT.

2633
01:20:50,746 --> 01:20:53,448
WE TRIED.

2634
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:55,216
BUT I AGREE.

2635
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:57,385
AVEN, YOU SEEMED BLINDSIDED

2636
01:20:57,386 --> 01:20:58,619
WHEN SHE ENDED THINGS WITH YOU

2637
01:20:58,620 --> 01:20:59,254
THAT NIGHT.

2638
01:20:59,255 --> 01:21:01,388
GOING INTO THAT
NIGHT, WHAT WERE

2639
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:03,958
YOU HOPING?

2640
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:05,626
YEAH, OBVIOUSLY LEAVING YOU

2641
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:08,229
THAT DAY ON THE BRIDGE WAS TO

2642
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:08,996
TOUGH.

2643
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:10,765
I WASN'T FEELING GOOD ABOUT

2644
01:21:10,766 --> 01:21:14,001
WHERE WE ARE AT OBVIOUSLY.

2645
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:15,536
I THINK THAT NIGHT
I REALLY JUST

2646
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:18,406
WANTED TO REITERATE
TO YOU THAT

2647
01:21:18,407 --> 01:21:19,941
I WASN'T GIVING UP ON US.

2648
01:21:19,942 --> 01:21:22,009
I WANTED TO CONTINUE WITH YOU.

2649
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:23,611
I WANTED TO CONTINUE OUR

2650
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:25,879
RELATIONSHIP AND MOVE PAST AND

2651
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,781
MOVE FORWARD.

2652
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:30,317
BUT OBVIOUSLY
KIND OF REALIZING

2653
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:31,419
AGAIN THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING

2654
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:33,488
THAT YOU WANTED BETWEEN US.

2655
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:35,423
I'M SORRY THAT I WASN'T THERE.

2656
01:21:35,424 --> 01:21:36,958
I'M SORRY THAT
WE WEREN'T THERE.

2657
01:21:36,959 --> 01:21:38,393
I FELT LIKE WE
WEREN'T THERE IN

2658
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:39,061
THAT MOMENT.

2659
01:21:39,062 --> 01:21:40,161
I WAS JUST HOPING THAT WE CAN

2660
01:21:40,162 --> 01:21:43,464
CONTINUE THINGS.

2661
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:44,499
OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T REALLY SEE

2662
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,267
EYE TO EYE ON THAT.

2663
01:21:45,268 --> 01:21:47,935
RACHEL, HOW
DO YOU FEEL ABOUT

2664
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:48,137
THAT?

2665
01:21:48,138 --> 01:21:50,104
I THINK IT'S ALL COMPLETELY

2666
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:50,472
UNDERSTANDABLE.

2667
01:21:50,473 --> 01:21:52,140
AT THE END OF
THE DAY, YOU WERE

2668
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:54,475
BEING HONEST WITH YOURSELF AND

2669
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:56,677
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY
REALLY HARD TO

2670
01:21:56,678 --> 01:21:58,579
HEAR BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE WERE

2671
01:21:58,580 --> 01:21:59,415
ON THE SAME PAGE.

2672
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:01,682
BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTY

2673
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:02,484
AND YOU DON'T
HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

2674
01:22:02,485 --> 01:22:06,486
HELP US CLEAR
THAT UP, AVEN.

2675
01:22:06,487 --> 01:22:07,121
OBVIOUSLY IN THE FANTASY SUITE

2676
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:08,589
YOU TOLD RACHEL THAT YOU ARE

2677
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,258
READY FOR AN
ENGAGEMENT BUT THEN

2678
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:11,893
YOU MET HER FAMILY AND HER

2679
01:22:11,894 --> 01:22:14,796
FRIENDS AND ALL
OF A SUDDEN, YOU

2680
01:22:14,797 --> 01:22:15,063
WEREN'T.

2681
01:22:15,064 --> 01:22:16,798
WHAT CHANGED?

2682
01:22:16,799 --> 01:22:17,433
WHAT HAPPENED?

2683
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:18,032
YEAH.

2684
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:19,534
I THINK KIND OF LEADING UP TO

2685
01:22:19,535 --> 01:22:22,970
MEETING YOUR FAMILY, I KIND OF

2686
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:24,638
JUST HAD SOME TIME AND TOOK A

2687
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:27,674
LOOK AT WHERE WE
WERE AT, WHERE

2688
01:22:27,675 --> 01:22:30,011
I WAS AT.

2689
01:22:30,012 --> 01:22:31,345
I WAS REALLY ANTICIPATING

2690
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:32,114
MEETING THEM
BECAUSE I WANTED TO

2691
01:22:32,115 --> 01:22:33,414
GO UP THERE AND BE AS HONEST

2692
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:35,983
WITH HOW I WAS FEELING IN THAT

2693
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:37,485
MOMENT TOWARDS THE PEOPLE THAT

2694
01:22:37,486 --> 01:22:39,954
MEAN THE MOST TO YOU.

2695
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:42,423
I JUST UNFORTUNATELY
DIDN'T GET

2696
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:44,459
THE OPPORTUNITY TO TELL YOU

2697
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,093
FIRST.

2698
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:45,727
WHICH OBVIOUSLY
WAS THE DOWNFALL

2699
01:22:45,728 --> 01:22:49,230
TO THE WHOLE THING.

2700
01:22:49,231 --> 01:22:51,165
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY THAT WEEK

2701
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:53,401
LEADING UP, I STILL DIDN'T

2702
01:22:53,402 --> 01:22:54,303
REALLY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AT

2703
01:22:54,304 --> 01:22:55,703
WITH TINO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

2704
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:58,573
THINGS SO THAT WEIGHT ON THE A

2705
01:22:58,574 --> 01:22:59,341
LITTLE BIT.

2706
01:22:59,341 --> 01:22:59,942
ULTIMATELY I THOUGHT THAT WE

2707
01:22:59,943 --> 01:23:02,143
COULD HAVE GOTTEN THERE.

2708
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:04,779
IF WE WOULD'VE CONTINUED ON.

2709
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:06,647
BUT I JUST DIDN'T GET THE

2710
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,415
OPPORTUNITY TO
KIND OF SPEAK TO

2711
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,418
YOU BEFORE AND
I DIDN'T WANT TO

2712
01:23:10,419 --> 01:23:11,519
NOT TO BE HONEST WITH YOUR

2713
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,254
FAMILY.

2714
01:23:12,255 --> 01:23:14,555
I'M SORRY THE WAY THINGS

2715
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:16,557
TRANSPIRED.

2716
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:18,226
WHEN YOU MET HER FAMILY AND

2717
01:23:18,227 --> 01:23:21,796
YOU SPOKE TO HER
FRIENDS, DO YOU

2718
01:23:21,797 --> 01:23:24,165
FEEL LIKE HER
FRIENDS SABOTAGED

2719
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,500
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH RACHEL?

2720
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,034
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

2721
01:23:27,035 --> 01:23:28,302
THEY DIDN'T SABOTAGE THE

2722
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:29,303
RELATIONSHIP AT ALL.

2723
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:31,439
THE QUESTIONS THEY WERE ASKING

2724
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,407
ME WERE WAY FORWARD, UP FRONT,

2725
01:23:32,408 --> 01:23:34,475
THEY A PURPOSE.

2726
01:23:34,476 --> 01:23:37,945
IN THAT MOMENT I WANTED TO BE

2727
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:38,914
HONEST ABOUT WHERE I FELT WE

2728
01:23:38,915 --> 01:23:43,518
WERE AT AND I WAS AT.

2729
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:44,552
YEAH, GOING BACK TO YOU AND

2730
01:23:44,553 --> 01:23:45,887
LETTING YOU KNOW
WHAT I SAID AND

2731
01:23:45,888 --> 01:23:46,855
EVERYTHING LIKE THAT.

2732
01:23:46,856 --> 01:23:48,623
YEAH, I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE

2733
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:50,491
HONEST WITH THEM
WHEN THEY WERE

2734
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:51,692
ASKING THOSE TOUGH QUESTIONS.

2735
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,394
YOUR FRIENDS LOVE YOU SO

2736
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:53,594
MUCH.

2737
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:56,063
WHEN YOU SAW THAT
BACK, WHAT DID

2738
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:56,798
YOU THINK?

2739
01:23:56,799 --> 01:23:58,299
I ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS TO

2740
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,500
EVERYONE.

2741
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:00,735
I FEEL LIKE
EVERYONE IS A TOUGH

2742
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:00,936
BUNCH.

2743
01:24:00,937 --> 01:24:03,104
THEY REALLY WANTED
TO MAKE SURE

2744
01:24:03,105 --> 01:24:04,372
THAT HE WAS READY ND THAT'S

2745
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:06,007
WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

2746
01:24:06,008 --> 01:24:06,642
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE EVER

2747
01:24:06,643 --> 01:24:09,410
TRYING TO SABOTAGE ANYTHING.

2748
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:11,279
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

2749
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,713
AVEN, OBVIOUSLY YOU AND

2750
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:14,949
RACHEL HAVE BEEN
THROUGH SO MUCH

2751
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:15,217
TOGETHER.

2752
01:24:15,218 --> 01:24:17,218
UPS AND DOWNS, WHEN YOU LOOK

2753
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,954
BACK AT THIS WHOLE THING, ANY

2754
01:24:19,955 --> 01:24:21,222
REGRETS?

2755
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:25,860
I MEAN, YEAH.

2756
01:24:25,861 --> 01:24:27,461
I COULD HAVE GONE ABOUT

2757
01:24:27,462 --> 01:24:28,196
COMMUNICATING TO
YOU ABOUT WHERE

2758
01:24:28,197 --> 01:24:34,334
I WAS AT A LOT BETTER.

2759
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:35,304
BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE

2760
01:24:35,305 --> 01:24:37,104
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU

2761
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:37,839
BEFORE THAT DAY OBVIOUSLY IS A

2762
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:41,842
BIG REGRET OF MINE.

2763
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:44,345
AGAIN, JUST NOT TAKING ENOUGH

2764
01:24:44,346 --> 01:24:46,914
TIME TO REALIZE
WHAT YOU WANTED

2765
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:47,382
OUT OF ALL OF THIS.

2766
01:24:47,383 --> 01:24:49,717
AND WHAT WAS IMPORTANT TO YOU.

2767
01:24:49,718 --> 01:24:51,052
IT'S SOMETHING
I REGRET BECAUSE

2768
01:24:51,053 --> 01:24:52,053
I COULD HAVE DONE A WAY BETTER

2769
01:24:52,054 --> 01:24:53,588
JOB AT THAT.

2770
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:56,290
I REGRET THAT DEEPLY.

2771
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:58,793
RACHEL, I KNOW FOR YOU WITH

2772
01:24:58,794 --> 01:24:59,761
RESPECT TO AVEN, NONE OF THIS

2773
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:01,829
HAPPENED BECAUSE OF A LACK OF

2774
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:02,097
FEELINGS.

2775
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:05,700
HOW HARD IS IT
FOR YOU NOW THESE

2776
01:25:05,701 --> 01:25:08,002
LAST COUPLE MONTHS, TRYING TO

2777
01:25:08,003 --> 01:25:10,605
AVOID THE THOUGHTS
OF "WHAT IF"

2778
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:11,772
WITH AVEN?

2779
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:13,441
I THINK YOU CAN ALWAYS GO

2780
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:15,009
BACK ON "WHAT IF."

2781
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:17,011
AT THE TIME, HE WAS DOING WHAT

2782
01:25:17,012 --> 01:25:18,779
WAS BEST FOR HIM.

2783
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:19,914
MY FEELINGS WERE ALWAYS THERE.

2784
01:25:19,915 --> 01:25:22,049
IT JUST WAS KIND
OF, WE WEREN'T

2785
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:23,784
ON THE SAME PAGE AT THE END OF

2786
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:25,319
THE DAY AND THERE'S NOTHING

2787
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:25,654
BESIDES THAT.

2788
01:25:25,655 --> 01:25:27,989
YOU ARE PERFECT.

2789
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:30,358
IT WAS HARD.

2790
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:31,692
CANT REALLY LOOK BACK.

2791
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:33,227
WHAT ABOUT YOU, AVEN?

2792
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:34,762
AT THE TIME YOU
WERE SAYING YOU

2793
01:25:34,763 --> 01:25:35,664
WERE FALLING IN LOVE WITH

2794
01:25:35,664 --> 01:25:35,964
RACHEL.

2795
01:25:35,965 --> 01:25:37,765
DO YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT HER AND

2796
01:25:37,766 --> 01:25:39,133
WONDER WHAT COULD
HAVE HAPPENED,

2797
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,802
CONSIDERING THAT
THE TIMING JUST

2798
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:42,937
WASN'T RIGHT?

2799
01:25:42,938 --> 01:25:43,672
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

2800
01:25:43,673 --> 01:25:46,774
LIKE I SAID THAT NIGHT, I WAS

2801
01:25:46,775 --> 01:25:48,542
TRYING TO FIGHT FOR OUR

2802
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:50,011
RELATIONSHIP
WHERE IT WAS AT AT

2803
01:25:50,012 --> 01:25:50,746
THAT POINT.

2804
01:25:50,747 --> 01:25:53,748
I WANTED TO CONTINUE.

2805
01:25:53,749 --> 01:25:54,915
I WASN'T GIVING UP ON YOU.

2806
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:56,083
UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE EVENTS

2807
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:58,218
THAT HAPPENED AND
THE WAY THAT I

2808
01:25:58,219 --> 01:25:59,954
WENT ABOUT THINGS, YOU JUST

2809
01:25:59,955 --> 01:26:01,322
DIDN'T AGREE.

2810
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:04,058
I THINK THAT'S
ALL ABOUT TIMING

2811
01:26:04,059 --> 01:26:04,960
AND ALIGNING THINGS.

2812
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:05,661
YEAH.

2813
01:26:05,662 --> 01:26:07,528
I WANTED TO CONTINUE WITH

2814
01:26:07,529 --> 01:26:07,829
EVERYTHING.

2815
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:08,995
BUT I AGREE THAT MAYBE THE

2816
01:26:08,996 --> 01:26:10,698
TIMING WAS OFF ABOUT WHERE WE

2817
01:26:10,699 --> 01:26:12,033
WERE AT NOT BEING ON THE SAME

2818
01:26:12,034 --> 01:26:13,034
PAGE.

2819
01:26:13,035 --> 01:26:15,169
BEFORE WE MOVE
ON, RACHEL, I

2820
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:15,937
WILL GIVE YOU THE FINAL WORD.

2821
01:26:15,938 --> 01:26:17,571
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO

2822
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:17,839
AVEN?

2823
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,341
I'M REALLY
HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

2824
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:22,243
I REALLY JUST WISH YOU NOTHING

2825
01:26:22,244 --> 01:26:23,310
BUT THE BEST.

2826
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:24,979
I REALLY JUST UNHAPPY THAT WE

2827
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:26,914
WERE ABLE TO HAVE
THE CHANCE TO

2828
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:27,549
SIT DOWN AND TALK.

2829
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:28,649
I FEEL LIKE IT WAS REALLY

2830
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:29,251
HELPFUL.

2831
01:26:29,252 --> 01:26:31,018
IT IS REALLY
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

2832
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:33,387
AVEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

2833
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:33,689
BEING HERE.

2834
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:34,922
I KNOW THESE THINGS ARE ALWAYS

2835
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:35,424
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

2836
01:26:35,425 --> 01:26:37,191
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING

2837
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:37,993
HONEST.

2838
01:26:37,994 --> 01:26:39,459
WISH YOU ALL THE BEST MOVING

2839
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:40,128
FORWARD.

2840
01:26:40,129 --> 01:26:41,962
APPRECIATE IT.

2841
01:26:41,963 --> 01:26:43,897
WHEN WE RETURN, GABBY WILL BE

2842
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:47,935

2843
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:49,637
ERICH.

2844
01:26:49,638 --> 01:26:53,841
RACHEL HAS ONE GUY LEFT.

2845
01:26:53,842 --> 01:26:54,142
THAT'S TINO.

2846
01:26:54,143 --> 01:26:55,942
WILL THESE TWO MEN GIVE THESE

2847
01:26:55,943 --> 01:26:57,812
INCREDIBLE WOMEN THE LOVE THEY

2848
01:26:57,813 --> 01:26:58,180
SO DESERVE?

2849
01:26:58,181 --> 01:26:59,413
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WANT TO

2850
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:01,749
MISS WHAT HAPPENS
NEXT WHEN THE

2851
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:02,517

2853
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,134
WELCOME BACK TO THE LIVE

2854
01:27:20,135 --> 01:27:20,736
FINALE OF "THE BACHELORETTE."

2855
01:27:20,737 --> 01:27:22,002
I AM HERE WITH
GABBY AND RACHEL,

2856
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:26,474
TWO AMAZING WOMEN
WHO HAVE BEEN

2857
01:27:26,475 --> 01:27:27,442
IN THIS THING
TOGETHER FROM THE

2858
01:27:27,443 --> 01:27:29,810
VERY BEGINNING.

2859
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:30,478
IT'S BEEN QUITE A SURPRISING

2860
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:35,349
NIGHT SO FAR,

2861
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:36,318
SO MANY TWISTS AND TURNS.

2862
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:37,785
AND WE'RE NOT DONE YET.

2863
01:27:37,786 --> 01:27:41,388
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

2864
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:42,490
WE ARE OVER OUR ALLOTTED TIME

2865
01:27:42,491 --> 01:27:45,025
BUT WHAT WE ARE
DISCUSSING IS SO

2866
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:45,293
IMPORTANT.

2867
01:27:45,294 --> 01:27:47,261
WE'VE GOTTEN
SPECIAL PERMISSION

2868
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:47,929
FROM ABC TO
CONTINUE THIS SO WE

01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,730

2872
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:55,201
RACHEL, I WANT
TO ASK, WHAT HAS

2873
01:27:55,202 --> 01:27:55,837
IT BEEN LIKE
REHASHING A LOT OF

2874
01:27:55,838 --> 01:27:58,973
STUFF IN FRONT OF A LIVE

2875
01:27:58,974 --> 01:27:59,241
AUDIENCE?

2876
01:27:59,242 --> 01:28:02,376
VERY EMOTIONAL.

2877
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:07,181
GETTING SOME GOOD CLOSURE.

2878
01:28:07,182 --> 01:28:09,784
HOPEFULLY CAN
COME OUT POSITIVE.

2879
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:10,652
GABBY, HOW ABOUT YOU?

2880
01:28:10,653 --> 01:28:13,220
YES, THE SAME.

2881
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:17,491
IT'S ALWAYS HARD.

2882
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:17,925
HARD FOR BOTH OF US.

2883
01:28:17,926 --> 01:28:20,127
I'M SO GRATEFUL TO HAVE

2884
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:22,797
RACHAEL'S SUPPORT
AND TO BE HERE

2885
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:23,798
FOR YOU.

2886
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:24,366
A LOT OF NERVOUS ENERGY.

2887
01:28:24,367 --> 01:28:29,736
IT'S NOT JUST YOU.

2888
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:33,741
HAVING YOU BOTH HERE TONIGHT.

2889
01:28:34,644 --> 01:28:35,910
HAVING YOU BOTH
HERE, THANK YOU

2890
01:28:35,911 --> 01:28:40,347
BOTH SO MUCH.

2891
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:40,615
MS. GABBY.

2892
01:28:40,616 --> 01:28:42,082
IT'S TIME FOR YOUR FINAL DATE

2893
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:49,022
WITH ERICH.

2894
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:56,264
TAKE A LOOK.

2895
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:02,903
I'M SO EXCITED TO SEE ERICH

2896
01:29:02,904 --> 01:29:03,305
TONIGHT.

2897
01:29:03,306 --> 01:29:04,438
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT HIM ALL

2898
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:05,073
DAY.

2899
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:05,773
I JUST WANT TO
BE WRAPPED UP IN

2900
01:29:05,773 --> 01:29:06,773
HIS ARMS AGAIN.

2901
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:12,513
I CAME HERE TO FIND MY PERSON,

2902
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:13,148
AND ERIC REALLY HAS SHOWN ME

2903
01:29:13,149 --> 01:29:21,149
THAT HE'S IT FOR ME.

2904
01:29:25,927 --> 01:29:26,228
HI.

2905
01:29:26,229 --> 01:29:27,795
I LOVE HIM
'CAUSE HE MAKES ME

2906
01:29:27,796 --> 01:29:28,829
FEEL SAFE.

2907
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:29,297
HE MAKES ME FEEL SEEN.

2908
01:29:29,297 --> 01:29:29,965
AND HE JUST HAS
EVERYTHING THAT

2909
01:29:29,965 --> 01:29:30,665
I'VE EVER LOOKED
FOR IN SOMEONE.

2910
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:32,066
SO I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY

2911
01:29:32,067 --> 01:29:33,334
REALLY, REALLY HOPE THAT HE'S,

2912
01:29:33,335 --> 01:29:34,635
AT THE END OF
THIS, PROPOSING TO

2913
01:29:34,636 --> 01:29:36,604
ME AND FEELS THE SAME.

2914
01:29:36,605 --> 01:29:39,540
YOU KNOW, IF HE
WAS, LIKE, "I'M

2915
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:41,442
NOT READY," I THINK THAT WOULD

2916
01:29:41,443 --> 01:29:44,044
MAKE ME THINK,
LIKE, "IS IT ME?"

2917
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:45,045
LIKE, "IS THERE SOMETHING THAT

2918
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:45,981
WENT WRONG?

2919
01:29:45,982 --> 01:29:47,281
ARE WE NOT READY FOR EACH

2920
01:29:47,282 --> 01:29:49,783
OTHER?"

2921
01:29:49,784 --> 01:29:51,051
IT'S, LIKE, CRAZY THAT THIS IS

2922
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:54,588
OUR LAST DAY.

2923
01:29:54,589 --> 01:29:58,259
AND I DO FEEL, LIKE, MORE THAN

2924
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:01,595
GOOD ABOUT LEAVING HERE WITH

2925
01:30:01,596 --> 01:30:01,796
YOU.

2926
01:30:01,797 --> 01:30:05,799
AND THAT'S SCARY
FOR ME TO SAY.

2927
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,903
I'M SURE IT'S
THE SAME TO HEAR.

2928
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:09,537
BUT I HONESTLY
CAME HERE, LIKE,

2929
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:10,138
NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS GOING TO

2930
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:13,774
HAPPEN AT THE END.

2931
01:30:13,775 --> 01:30:14,409
EVERYTHING ALONG
THE WAY, LIKE,

2932
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:15,043
SOME OF MY HARDEST GOODBYES I

2933
01:30:15,044 --> 01:30:17,778
FEEL LIKE HAVE
ALWAYS LED ME TO

2934
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:18,079
YOU.

2935
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,247
SO I DON'T KNOW.

2936
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:20,916
I DON'T KNOW.

2937
01:30:20,917 --> 01:30:28,254
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A LOT.

2938
01:30:28,255 --> 01:30:29,924
I THINK THIS IS... IT'S, LIKE,

2939
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:32,192
INSANE TO LOOK BACK ON.

2940
01:30:32,193 --> 01:30:36,063
NO, HONESTLY, WHICH IS WHY,

2941
01:30:36,064 --> 01:30:37,097
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE I DON'T WANT

2942
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:39,566
TO PUT PRESSURE ON ME OR YOU.

2943
01:30:39,567 --> 01:30:42,002
YEAH.

2944
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:44,972
I THINK IT'S,
LIKE, I OBVIOUSLY

2945
01:30:44,973 --> 01:30:46,640
DIDN'T EXPECT TO
EVER BE HERE IN

2946
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:48,075
THIS POSITION OR EVEN, LIKE,

2947
01:30:48,076 --> 01:30:48,943
STEPPING OUT OF THE LIMO NIGHT

2948
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:49,611
ONE, LIKE, LOOKING BACK ON IT

2949
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:50,245
NOW, IT'S JUST, LIKE, "WHAT IN

2950
01:30:50,246 --> 01:30:52,980
THE HELL?"

2951
01:30:52,981 --> 01:30:53,380
LIKE, IT'S INSANE.

2952
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:54,882
AND IT WAS, LIKE, FROM THAT

2953
01:30:54,883 --> 01:30:56,750
POINT, I, LIKE,
I REALIZED THAT

2954
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:59,119
I WAS STARTING
TO FALL FOR YOU.

2955
01:30:59,120 --> 01:30:59,955
AND IT JUST KEPT
GETTING, LIKE,

2956
01:30:59,956 --> 01:31:03,624
MORE AND MORE.

2957
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:06,060
I THINK THAT'S KIND OF, LIKE,

2958
01:31:06,061 --> 01:31:06,594
OUR RELATIONSHIP IN THE

2959
01:31:06,595 --> 01:31:07,695
BEGINNING WAS, LIKE, PHYSICAL

2960
01:31:07,696 --> 01:31:15,696
AND FUNNY.

2961
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,406
AND THEN I WAS,
LIKE, ALL RIGHT,

2962
01:31:20,407 --> 01:31:20,976
I'M GOING TO TAKE A RISK AND

2963
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:21,576
JUST OPEN UP TO THIS GIRL AND

2964
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:22,243
JUST GIVE HER,
LIKE, 100% OF ME.

2965
01:31:22,244 --> 01:31:23,244
AND YOU MATCHED
ME, LIKE, EVERY

2966
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:23,945
STEP OF THE WAY,
WHICH I KNOW IS

2967
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:24,312
NOT EASY TO DO.

2968
01:31:24,313 --> 01:31:25,379
AND FOR ME, IT WAS NOT EASY TO

2969
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:25,847
DO EITHER.

2970
01:31:25,847 --> 01:31:26,380
IT'S BEEN CRAZY.

2971
01:31:26,381 --> 01:31:27,614
BUT I TRULY LOVE YOU, AND I

2972
01:31:27,615 --> 01:31:27,816
DO...

2973
01:31:27,817 --> 01:31:29,283
I DO WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF

2974
01:31:29,284 --> 01:31:30,151
MY LIFE WITH YOU.

2975
01:31:30,152 --> 01:31:31,152
AND I DON'T WANT TO RUSH

2976
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:32,218
ANYTHING AND I
DON'T WANT THERE

2977
01:31:32,219 --> 01:31:35,055
TO BE ANY EXPECTATIONS OR

2978
01:31:35,056 --> 01:31:37,790
ANYTHING THAT WOULDN'T BE

2979
01:31:37,791 --> 01:31:40,894
NATURAL TO US.

2980
01:31:40,895 --> 01:31:41,796
I'M TELLING YOU
HOW MUCH I LOVE

2981
01:31:41,797 --> 01:31:48,968
YOU.

2982
01:31:48,969 --> 01:31:54,408
I STILL HAVE SO MANY

2983
01:31:54,409 --> 01:31:55,843
QESTIONS THAT I
JUST HOPE I CAN

2984
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:56,478
FIGURE OUT,
BECAUSE I DO WANT A

2985
01:31:56,479 --> 01:32:04,479
PROPOSAL FROM HIM.

2986
01:32:08,089 --> 01:32:08,723
AND I'M JUST
LOOKING FOR HONESTY

2987
01:32:08,723 --> 01:32:09,591
WITH HIM.

2988
01:32:09,592 --> 01:32:11,258
I KNOW, LIKE, THE
TRUTH, IF IT'S

2989
01:32:11,259 --> 01:32:11,860
NOT WHAT I WANT TO HEAR, IF HE

2990
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:12,494
SAYS HE'S NOT
READY TO PROPOSE,

2991
01:32:12,494 --> 01:32:13,193
IT'S GOING TO HURT NO MATTER

2992
01:32:13,193 --> 01:32:13,628
WHAT.

2993
01:32:13,628 --> 01:32:14,195
BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW THE

2994
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:14,529
TRUTH.

2995
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:15,230
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, I WANT TO

2996
01:32:15,231 --> 01:32:18,799
LEAVE HERE WITH YOU.

2997
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,367
I DO.

2998
01:32:19,368 --> 01:32:21,502
I KNOW THIS
IS A BIG DEAL, AN

2999
01:32:21,503 --> 01:32:24,905
ENGAGEMENT AND EVERYTHING.

3000
01:32:24,906 --> 01:32:26,206
I WISH I KNEW BETTER AND I CAN

3001
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:26,875
JUST BE, LIKE, "THIS IS 100%

3002
01:32:26,876 --> 01:32:28,876
EVERYTHING AND I'VE BEEN HERE

3003
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:29,942
BEFORE AND I KNOW
HOW TO HANDLE

3004
01:32:29,943 --> 01:32:30,944
THE SITUATION."

3005
01:32:30,945 --> 01:32:37,351
BUT IT'S JUST, I DON'T KNOW.

3006
01:32:37,352 --> 01:32:38,286
I FEEL PRETTY
GOOD ABOUT WHAT

3007
01:32:38,287 --> 01:32:40,988
A LIFE WITH YOU WOULD BE LIKE.

3008
01:32:40,989 --> 01:32:42,522
I HOPE IT'S LIKE THIS.

3009
01:32:42,523 --> 01:32:44,424
THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS

3010
01:32:44,425 --> 01:32:47,161
PUT PRESSURE ON YOU.

3011
01:32:47,162 --> 01:32:55,135
BUT I DON'T... I'M NOT THE ONE

3012
01:32:55,136 --> 01:32:57,771
PROPOSING, AND
THAT'S WHY, LIKE,

3013
01:32:57,772 --> 01:32:59,106
I DON'T KNOW, WE KIND OF LIKE

3014
01:32:59,107 --> 01:33:01,075
SEE, MAYBE.

3015
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:03,510
BUT IF WE HAVE
TO, LIKE, LISTEN

3016
01:33:03,511 --> 01:33:05,012
TO OURSELVES.

3017
01:33:05,013 --> 01:33:08,048
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, "SEE?"

3018
01:33:08,049 --> 01:33:13,554
I DON'T KNOW.

3019
01:33:18,827 --> 01:33:20,761
I REALLY WANT US
TO WORK, AND I

3020
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:22,196
KNOW, LIKE, I
THINK ALL ODDS ARE

3021
01:33:22,197 --> 01:33:24,565
KIND OF WORKING AGAINST THAT.

3022
01:33:24,566 --> 01:33:25,766
BUT I JUST, LIKE,
I WANT TO DATE

3023
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:27,801
YOU.

3024
01:33:27,802 --> 01:33:29,236
IN THE REAL WORLD, LIKE,

3025
01:33:29,237 --> 01:33:30,071
I WANT TO DATE YOU.

3026
01:33:30,072 --> 01:33:31,972
AND IT'S...

3027
01:33:31,973 --> 01:33:33,006
GETTING ENGAGED BEFORE THAT

3028
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:33,808
HAPPENS, IS THAT HOW THINGS

3029
01:33:33,809 --> 01:33:37,744
USUALLY GO?

3030
01:33:37,745 --> 01:33:40,747
YEAH.

3031
01:33:40,748 --> 01:33:47,120
ALL I WANTED WAS CLARITY.

3032
01:33:47,121 --> 01:33:48,155
I'M SORRY IF THIS HAS BEEN

3033
01:33:48,156 --> 01:33:48,556
UPSETTING.

3034
01:33:48,557 --> 01:33:49,756
I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T REALLY

3035
01:33:49,757 --> 01:33:53,560
TALK ABOUT IT.

3036
01:33:53,561 --> 01:34:00,067
OKAY.

3037
01:34:00,068 --> 01:34:02,002
HE SAID "I WANT TO CONTINUE

3038
01:34:02,003 --> 01:34:04,204
TO DATE YOU."

3039
01:34:04,205 --> 01:34:04,672
SO THAT DOESN'T SCREAM

3040
01:34:04,673 --> 01:34:07,674
"I WANT TO PROPOSE."

3041
01:34:07,675 --> 01:34:08,709
I DON'T WANT TO FORCE HIM

3042
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:09,843
INTO A DECISION.

3043
01:34:09,844 --> 01:34:14,848
THIS IS ACTUALLY CRAZY.

3044
01:34:14,849 --> 01:34:20,420
I DON'T WANT TO
DO THIS ANYMORE.

3045
01:34:20,421 --> 01:34:21,022
NO, I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO BE

3046
01:34:21,023 --> 01:34:22,089
FORCED, JUST...

3047
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:29,396
LIKE, I AM SO SICK OF THIS.

3048
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:29,664
GABBY.

3049
01:34:29,665 --> 01:34:30,864
WHAT IS THIS?

3050
01:34:30,865 --> 01:34:32,165
HE'S NOT READY.

3051
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:34,501
HE JUST TOLD ME.

3052
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:36,537
HE SAID "I WANT TO DATE YOU."

3053
01:34:36,538 --> 01:34:39,272
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

3054
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:40,674
WHEN HIM AND I WERE OUT ON THE

3055
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:41,609
BALCONY, HE SAID "I WANT TO

3056
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:43,277
LEAVEHERE AND I WANT TO DATE

3057
01:34:43,278 --> 01:34:44,477
YOU."

3058
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:48,549
I WANT TO BE WITH ERICH.

3059
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:48,782
FOREVER.

3060
01:34:48,783 --> 01:34:51,418
SO I WANT HIM TO PROPOSE.

3061
01:34:51,419 --> 01:34:53,387
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, WALK

3062
01:34:53,388 --> 01:34:54,155
AWAY BECAUSE HE'S NOT READY TO

3063
01:34:54,156 --> 01:34:56,590
PROPOSE?

3064
01:34:56,591 --> 01:35:00,294
SO HERE WE ARE, BIG FAT

3065
01:35:00,295 --> 01:35:01,795
DUMPSTER FIRE.

3066
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:04,064
BIG MESS.

3067
01:35:26,187 --> 01:35:29,122
WELCOME BACK TO THE LIVE

3068
01:35:29,123 --> 01:35:29,724
FINALE OF "THE BACHELORETTE."

3069
01:35:29,725 --> 01:35:31,325
I AM HERE WITH
RACHEL AND GABBY

3070
01:35:31,326 --> 01:35:32,859
WHO HAVE BEN WATCHING WITH US

3071
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:33,528
ALL NIGHT.

3072
01:35:33,529 --> 01:35:38,198
AT THIS POINT,
ALL I CAN SAY IS

3073
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:38,633
WOW.

3074
01:35:38,634 --> 01:35:41,268
OBVIOUSLY I WAS THE BACHELOR

3075
01:35:41,269 --> 01:35:42,669
YEARS AND YEARS AGO.

3076
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:44,471
ANYTHING AS
EMOTIONAL AS WHAT WE

3077
01:35:44,472 --> 01:35:45,340
ARE SEEING.

3078
01:35:45,341 --> 01:35:46,540
THE BIG QUESTION RIGHT NOW IS,

3079
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:50,343
HOW IS THIS WHOLE
THING GOING TO

3080
01:35:50,344 --> 01:35:50,511
END?

3081
01:35:50,512 --> 01:35:52,279
EVERYBODY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

3082
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:56,450
ARE YOU READY
FOR A SNEAK PEEK?

3083
01:35:56,451 --> 01:35:56,784
ALL RIGHT.

3084
01:35:56,785 --> 01:36:04,785
HERE IT IS.

3085
01:36:05,559 --> 01:36:07,194
THIS IS CRAZY.

3086
01:36:07,195 --> 01:36:09,763
WE ARE LITERALLY ABOUT TO BE

3087
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:12,466
ENGAGED TOMORROW TO OUR DREAM

3088
01:36:12,467 --> 01:36:13,799
GUYS.

3089
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:14,235
LITERALLY DREAMS.

3090
01:36:14,235 --> 01:36:14,902
TINO TRULY IS THE MAN OF MY

3091
01:36:14,902 --> 01:36:15,136
DREAMS.

3092
01:36:15,136 --> 01:36:15,670
THIS IS THE DAY I'VE BEEN

3093
01:36:15,671 --> 01:36:17,838
WAITING FOR MY WHOLE LIFE.

3094
01:36:17,839 --> 01:36:19,406
I DO LOVE ERICH WITH ALL MY

3095
01:36:19,407 --> 01:36:20,275
HEART, SO I DO WANT A PROPOSAL

3096
01:36:20,276 --> 01:36:24,745
FROM HIM.

3097
01:36:24,746 --> 01:36:26,346
LIKE, I'M SO SICK OF THIS.

3098
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:27,948
I JUST REALLY NEED TO TELL

3099
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:30,484
YOU SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN

3100
01:36:30,485 --> 01:36:30,852
WEIGHING ON ME.

3101
01:36:30,852 --> 01:36:31,452
THERE IS NO WAY THIS WORKS

3102
01:36:31,453 --> 01:36:34,288
OUT.

3103
01:36:34,590 --> 01:36:38,859
NOBODY CAN
TELL ME I'M CRAZY.

3104
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:39,827
HE SAID I WANT TO LEAVE HERE

3105
01:36:39,828 --> 01:36:42,162
AND I WANT TO DATE YOU.

3106
01:36:42,163 --> 01:36:42,764
SHE'S THROWING ME UNDER THE

3107
01:36:42,765 --> 01:36:46,165
BUS SAYING ALL
OF THIS IS LIES?

3108
01:36:46,166 --> 01:36:47,401
SHE CALLED IT.

3109
01:36:47,402 --> 01:36:48,036
ALL I KNOW IS REJECTION.

3110
01:36:48,037 --> 01:36:49,670
IT'S SCARY AS HELL.

3111
01:36:49,671 --> 01:36:50,538
YOU'RE LYING STRAIGHT TO MY

3112
01:36:50,539 --> 01:36:51,938
FACE.

3113
01:36:51,939 --> 01:36:53,106
LOOK ME IN THE EYES

3114
01:36:53,107 --> 01:36:53,841
AND LIE TO ME AGAIN.

3115
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:54,275
YOU DID SAY THAT.

3116
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:54,942
YOU SAID THAT.

3117
01:36:54,943 --> 01:36:56,843
I WANT TO LEAVE
HERE ENGAGED.

3118
01:36:56,844 --> 01:36:58,912
IF HE DOESN'T PROPOSE,

3119
01:36:58,913 --> 01:36:59,913
I'LL BE DEVASTATED.

3120
01:36:59,914 --> 01:37:01,248
I WANT AN ANSWER FOR WHY

3121
01:37:01,249 --> 01:37:04,418
YOU DID WHAT YOU DID.

3122
01:37:04,419 --> 01:37:07,220
HONESTLY, I THINK HE MIGHT

3123
01:37:07,221 --> 01:37:10,957
WALK AWAY.

3124
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:11,492
I HAVE NEVER FELT THIS

3125
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:13,293
BLINDSIDED AND BETRAYED.

3126
01:37:13,294 --> 01:37:21,294
I'M DONE.

3127
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:25,673
SEE?

3128
01:37:25,674 --> 01:37:26,772
I TOLD YOU.

3129
01:37:26,773 --> 01:37:30,911
THIS WAS THE MOST DRAMATIC

3130
01:37:30,912 --> 01:37:31,546
FINALE IN
BACHELORETTE HISTORY.

3131
01:37:31,547 --> 01:37:35,015
WE'LL BE BACK HERE ON STAGE.

3132
01:37:35,016 --> 01:37:37,217
WHO WILL BE ON
STAGE WITH A RING

3133
01:37:37,218 --> 01:37:38,951
ON HER FINGER?

3134
01:37:38,952 --> 01:37:40,087
WILL IT BE GABBY?

3135
01:37:40,088 --> 01:37:41,555
WILL IT BE RACHEL?

3136
01:37:41,556 --> 01:37:42,090
MIGHT IT BE BOTH?

3137
01:37:42,091 --> 01:37:44,758
WE CERTAINLY HOPE IT IS.

3138
01:37:44,759 --> 01:37:47,694
WHO IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT

3139
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:48,162
BACHELOR?

3140
01:37:48,163 --> 01:37:50,564
YOU'LL GET THE
ANSWERS TO ALL OF

3141
01:37:50,565 --> 01:37:51,598
THOSE QUESTIONS NEXT WEEK.

BACHELOR NATION

3146

3147
01:38:04,344 --> 01:38:05,412
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

3148
01:38:05,413 --> 01:38:09,850
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU.

3149
01:38:09,851 --> 01:38:12,718
BIG TONY IS GOING TO BE HERE.

3150

INTERACTIVE EVENT.
