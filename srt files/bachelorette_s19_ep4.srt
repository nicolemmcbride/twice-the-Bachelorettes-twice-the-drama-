1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:03,237
- Tonight
on "The Bachelorette"...

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,272
Gabby and Rachel!

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,474
We're the Bachelorettes!

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,944
- Paris is romantic.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,913
There's something in the air.

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,215
- Paris just does something
to you.

7
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,893
- There's gonna be
two separate groups now.

8
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:19,319
We're on two separate journeys.

9
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:20,721
- You bring sunshine

10
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,122
to rainy days in Paris.

11
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,626
I never thought I would
be able to find someone.

12
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,028
And, like, now it's
right in front of my face.

13
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:29,630
- If you can't find
the romance here,

14
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,940
take that long flight home,
baby.

15
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,232
- It feels like a fairy tale.

16
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,902
And I wish I could just
hang out here forever.

17
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,871
- Rachel gave me a rose.

18
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,106
But every time I'm in

19
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,641
the same room
as Gabby and Rachel,

20
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,010
I realize my feelings
toward Gabby.

21
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,811
- He made a vulgar comparison.

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,381
Something about,
"I don't trust these bitches."

23
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,584
- I've tried hard
to put my feelings aside,

24
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,119
but the heart
wants what it wants.

25
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,555
- I want someone who
is going to fight for me.

26
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:56,557
- Every single day

27
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,158
is like a roller coaster.

28
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,465
- Why does she look pissed off?

29
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,237
- Do you know why I'm
talking to you right now?

30
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,529
The shock on their faces.

31
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,598
No one even knew
what it was coming from.

32
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,009
- Rachel was given
some information

33
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:09,836
about some things said
that was really disturbing.

34
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,573
- I hate every single day
having to get to the point

35
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,740
of wanting to leave.

36
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,442
I'm just so over this.

37
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,810
I'm so done.

38
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:26,053
- So who here is with Gabby?

39
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,322
- Team Gabby.

40
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,990
- Okay, who here's with Rachel?

41
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,326
Jeez.

42
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,561
- And who's here
for the right reasons?

43
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,228
- Yeah, who's here
for the right reasons?

44
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,335
- The guys are split
amongst two Bachelorettes.

45
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,437
Going into
the last Rose Ceremony,

46
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,238
the girls picked
their group of guys,

47
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,508
so it's a lot easier
for us to deduce,

48
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,611
like, where we stand
in the house.

49
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,179
I'm team Gabby all the way.

50
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,648
- I think that last night
was pretty intense.

51
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,183
- That was a lot for me.

52
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,684
I'm still trying to digest that.

53
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,120
- Yeah, I feel lucky
to still be here.

54
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,789
Rachel has given me
a second shot.

55
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,791
- Last night,
drama kind of ensued.

56
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,059
Rachel was upset

57
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,562
because three guys
declined her rose.

58
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,869
And then from my understanding,

59
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,799
there was a...
An issue with Hayden.

60
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,570
I think he said some
untoward things about Gabby.

61
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,940
- I used the word
"rough around the edges."

62
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,247
And what I meant by that was...

63
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,211
- Oh...

64
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,517
- But I gave context behind it.

65
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,689
It wasn't just, like,
a single word.

66
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,914
- Mm, that's...
- All right?

67
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,516
- That's kind of rough,
though, bro.

68
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,160
- Hayden's in the hot seat
because of, like,

69
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,719
the last Rose Ceremony.

70
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,955
He got a rose from Rachel.

71
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,691
But Gabby brings up
hurtful things have been said.

72
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,235
Maybe there is something
he possibly could have said

73
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,327
a little bit differently.

74
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,462
Hey, Hayden.

75
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,864
Good luck, dog.

76
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,266
- Gabby's the one
that used the word

77
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,702
"rough around the edges."

78
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:49,703
- She said that?

79
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,837
- Twice.

80
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,572
- Oh, really?
- And I used that word

81
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,141
to describe her.

82
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:57,077
And that's what they threw
back in my face.

83
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,024
- Mind if I slide in here?
- Yeah, buddy.

84
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,683
- Thanks.

85
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,818
- Like, I would hope that Gabby

86
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,587
is a little bit more mature
than that.

87
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,966
I don't think I said anything
wrong, to be honest with you.

88
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,958
My dumb ass uses
the same verbiage

89
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,894
that Gabby uses
to describe herself,

90
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,929
and she didn't like that.

91
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,206
Well, bitch,
maybe you shouldn't use

92
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,941
that word
to describe yourself then.

93
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,468
- Oh, my God.

94
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,645
I'm definitely seeing Hayden

95
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,904
in a totally different light.

96
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,605
You know,
he's saying things like

97
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,008
they overreacted,
both Gabby and Rachel.

98
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,077
He called them bitches.

99
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,845
It's disturbing,
and it's not how

100
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,281
you should treat
or speak about women at all.

101
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,583
- Yeah, dude.

102
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,951
And... and that happened,

103
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,762
and so, like,
now I've been comparing, right?

104
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,088
I've been comparing my ex

105
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,825
to, like... like, this, right?

106
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,160
They don't hold a candle to her.

107
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,496
And I don't want to just settle.

108
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,732
I can tell you right now,
I don't see

109
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,233
how any guy in here
could be, like,

110
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,203
"I'm marrying
these girls."

111
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,439
- Hearing this from Hayden
is shocking,

112
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,508
and that doesn't sit well
with me.

113
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,144
You know, Rachel gave me
a second chance,

114
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,280
and I want to be as honest
with her as possible.

115
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,516
If he's not totally invested
in Rachel,

116
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,485
then he should go home.

117
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,486
- Jesse.

118
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,920
- Hey.
- Jesse.

119
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,021
How we doing?

120
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,590
What's up, fellas?

121
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,301
All right, well, I hope
you all got some sleep.

122
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,459
You're gonna need it,

123
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:20,660
because today,

124
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:21,804
a whole new part of this journey

125
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,164
is about to start
for all of you.

126
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,633
Gabby and Rachel have moved
out of their mansion.

127
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,436
And they've left Los Angeles.

128
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,571
Right now, Gabby and Rachel
are on an airplane

129
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,306
somewhere over
the Atlantic Ocean,

130
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,775
and they are heading
to a country

131
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,578
that is world-famous
for romance.

132
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,581
Gabby and Rachel
are headed to France.

133
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,484
Ooh!

134
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:47,120
- Yes, all of you are gonna
be joining them there.

135
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:48,855
Yo!

136
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,892
- Here's the thing.

137
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,561
Not all of you
are headed there yet,

138
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,063
and that's because two
lucky gentlemen from this room

139
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,698
are gonna be joining
Gabby and Rachel

140
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,801
in one of the world's
most famous cities.

141
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,002
Paris.

142
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,538
- Ooh!
- To have two incredible dates

143
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,339
to start the week.

144
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,974
- There's nothing
I would want more

145
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,011
than to be on a plane
to go see Rachel in Paris.

146
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,013
I mean, that just validates

147
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,357
she really wants
to get to know me,

148
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,149
really wants to talk to me.

149
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,417
- I want that one-on-one time,

150
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,821
so I hope I get a date
with Ms. Gabriela.

151
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,123
Oui, oui. Oui, oui.

152
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,300
- So Gabby and Rachel,
they thought

153
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,458
long and hard about this.

154
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,327
And for this first
amazing date in Paris,

155
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,596
Gabby wants to spend it with...

156
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,866
Jason.

157
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:33,867
- Wow.
- Damn.

158
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,335
- Ooh.
- And Rachel's decided

159
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,504
that she wants
to spend her date...

160
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,572
with Tino.

161
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:39,573
- Ooh!
- Yes, sir.

162
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,907
Tino, Tino.

163
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,552
- All right, so, Tino, Jason,
say your goodbyes.

164
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,887
Car's waiting for you outside.
It's taking you to the airport.

165
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,422
You're flying to Paris
to meet the ladies.

166
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,824
Good luck, fellas.

167
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,749
- And for the rest of you,
go pack your bags.

168
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,351
Wheels up in an hour.

169
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:52,352
I'll see y'all in France.

170
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,420
- Yeah!
- Let's go!

171
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,522
- Let's do it.
- All right, guys.

172
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:56,723
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

173
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,892
- Yes!
- Let's go!

174
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,293
So fired up right now.

175
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,162
I'm, like...
I've been dying for, like,

176
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,396
this one-on-one time.

177
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,132
- This is so sick.
- Can't get over it.

178
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,568
I got a one-on-one with Gabby.

179
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,872
Dream girl, dream city.

180
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,206
I'm feeling it in my stomach.

181
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,441
Just, like, butterflies.

182
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,809
- Jason got the one-on-one.

183
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,878
Wish that could have been me,
but for now,

184
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,247
we're headed to France!

185
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,357
- I don't even know
how to feel right now.

186
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,381
Like, this is crazy.

187
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,950
- What do I know about France?

188
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,410
They eat a lot
of croissants there.

189
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,754
And it's a good love story

190
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,122
to fall in love in France.

191
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,124
Like, "We always have Paris."

192
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,295
- Au revoir, Bachelor mansion.

193
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,796
I'm coming, France.

194
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,231
I'm coming!

195
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,014
- Paris is romantic.

196
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,882
There's something in the air.

197
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,685
There's little tiny
cobblestone streets,

198
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,687
beautiful architecture.

199
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,522
So much history.

200
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,057
It's so beautiful.

201
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,426
So I feel incredibly grateful.

202
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:07,827
- I can't believe
we're in Paris.

203
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:08,894
- I know.

204
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,730
Especially after last week.

205
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:14,734
- The last Rose Ceremony
was the most unexpected thing.

206
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:18,104
I really just didn't
see it coming at all.

207
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,207
It's just really difficult
to be so vulnerable, like,

208
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,543
offering someone a rose,
standing up there,

209
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,880
and having them tell you no
multiple times.

210
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,782
I just...

211
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,417
- Like, rejection just hurts.

212
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,885
- That's the thing.
- Like, yeah.

213
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,421
- In that moment, I'm like,
no one wants to date me.

214
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,957
Like, why am I here?
- Mm-hmm.

215
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,092
- It was really... like,
that was probably my...

216
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,527
I thought I had
my lowest moment.

217
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,262
- Yeah.
- That was my lowest moment.

218
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,263
Hopefully.
- Yeah.

219
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,864
Yeah.

220
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:53,773
- At the last Rose Ceremony,
three men rejected my rose.

221
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,577
It's really, like, hurtful
and embarrassing, frankly,

222
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,845
to have that happen.

223
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,289
It really was
the most embarrassing thing

224
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,448
that's ever happened to me.

225
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,516
You feel rejected and you think,

226
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,884
well, what's wrong with me?

227
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,453
You just start to question

228
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,488
why anyone accepted your rose.

229
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,790
It has been a challenge
for Gabby and I

230
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:14,561
to have our insecurities
brought out

231
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,363
as being compared
to one another.

232
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,766
- There's always, like,
high highs after the low lows,

233
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,301
and I'm glad it happened
when it did.

234
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,578
- Mm-hmm.
- Because I feel like I have

235
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,238
so much more room
and space for other men now.

236
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,585
- That you know
are here for you.

237
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,741
- Yeah.

238
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,175
- I have a huge fear

239
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,543
that the men in my group

240
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,512
might not even
be interested in me

241
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:36,483
and will want to switch over
to pursue Gabby.

242
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,151
Or that they might feel like

243
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,053
they are in the loser group.

244
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,888
Oh, no, I'm nervous.
- Did you just see 'em?

245
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,056
- No.

246
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:46,226
Paris is supposed
to be romantic.

247
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:50,430
I don't want my insecurities
to ruin everything.

248
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,565
This date with Tino might be

249
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,001
the most important date
I've had.

250
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,871
Hopefully, we're able to
kind of get this back on track.

251
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:58,938
Oh, I see him.

252
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,774
You do?

253
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,209
- Because if it doesn't,
I just don't really

254
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,911
see a point in moving forward.

255
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,190
- Yo, we're in France right now.

256
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,291
- Fellas!
- Jesse.

257
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,459
- Hey.
- What's up?

258
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:20,894
- Welcome to France.

259
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,830
Yeah!

260
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,046
Anything?

261
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,582
Anybody speak French?

262
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:43,817
- No.
- Uh.

263
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,418
- Better to go back to English?

264
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:46,419
Yeah.

265
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,954
- Welcome to the port city

266
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,255
of La Havre, France.

267
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,990
We are a very short
distance away

268
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,126
from the incredible city
of Paris.

269
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,495
Now, you're not actually
gonna be living here

270
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:59,199
in La Havre because you're
going to be staying on a ship.

271
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,868
The Virgin Voyages'
Valiant Lady.

272
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,871
And she is a luxurious
state of the art ocean liner

273
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,240
that is gonna be your home base

274
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,984
while you embark on this
international journey

275
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,245
towards finding love
with Gabby or Rachel.

276
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,013
As we go,
you're gonna be stopping

277
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,584
to go on some
unbelievably romantic dates

278
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,487
in some of Europe's
most world-renowned cities.

279
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,188
All right,
I can tell you're all jonesing

280
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,666
to get on board
and check out your new digs.

281
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,791
So, guys, have at it.

282
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,359
The ship is yours.

283
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,562
- I just can't believe it.

284
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,564
The biggest thing I've
ever been on is a kayak.

285
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,066
- Wow, look at this, huh?

286
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,602
- They've got bars,
they've got stores,

287
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:36,936
they have a tattoo shop.

288
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,404
Everything is brand new.

289
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,506
It's pretty wild.

290
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,407
I wasn't expecting this.

291
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,119
- It's like no other
cruise ship I've ever seen.

292
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,344
It's more like a yacht.

293
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,345
It's, like, unbelievable.

294
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,546
- Let's go.
- Hey!

295
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:47,780
- Whoa, look at this!

296
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,249
- Bro, what?
- Look at all this.

297
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,893
- We're completely separated
in these two groups.

298
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,895
A Rachel group, and there's
gonna be a Gabby group.

299
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,296
We live on different floors,
we're segregated.

300
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,698
We have our own,
like, hang out groups.

301
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,266
It's gonna be
a way different experience

302
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,290
than it was at the house.

303
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,659
- Let's go.
- Whoo!

304
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:00,760
- Whoa!
- Oh!

305
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,128
- The rooms are incredible.

306
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,930
The hang out room, the bar

307
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,465
is a lot better
than the mansion.

308
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:06,532
Not even a question.

309
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,001
I love it.

310
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,335
- Ooh, a leather couch?

311
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,247
- We went straight from
that crazy Rose Ceremony

312
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,405
to a flight to Paris.

313
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,482
And now we're on a cruise ship.

314
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,674
I'm excited and I'm ready

315
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,609
to get a date with Rachel.

316
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,746
Bonjour, Rachel!

317
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,681
- You know,
Gabby's out right now.

318
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,550
The date's probably
going fantastic.

319
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,760
- I mean, if you can't
find the romance here...

320
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,985
- Yeah.
- In Paris.

321
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,296
- Then you can't find
the romance nowhere.

322
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,888
- Take that long flight home,
baby.

323
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,360
- I feel so good
going into this date.

324
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,396
Oh, I see him.

325
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,463
Hi!
- Hello!

326
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,531
- What's up, ladies?

327
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,366
- Oh, my... hi!

328
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,969
Rachel and I being able
to start over

329
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,338
in a new country
with Tino and Jason,

330
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,440
we're both really excited
for our opportunities

331
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,441
to go our separate ways.

332
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,442
- We're going that way.

333
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,044
- This could really be

334
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,246
the start of the rest
of our journey.

335
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,914
- Bye.
- And really change things

336
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:55,982
for both of us.

337
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,049
Bye, bye!
- Bye, guys!

338
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,921
- Wow.
- Oh, this is epic.

339
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,723
- It's so beautiful.

340
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,793
We're in France.
- I know.

341
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:07,970
- Started at
the Bachelor mansion.

342
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:10,063
- I came in
confident and all that,

343
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,465
but I didn't think it
would take off like this.

344
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,542
- Oh, you didn't think so?

345
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,926
You didn't think
you would like me?

346
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,645
- Well, I didn't think
you'd like me as much

347
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,469
as you do right now, okay?
- I don't like you.

348
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,675
- Well, then, I'm gonna keep
working on it, so good luck.

349
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,411
- Last week brought up
more fear and anxiety

350
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,146
than I ever thought
I could handle.

351
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,514
- Where's your hand?

352
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,019
- I was pretty low last week.

353
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:37,423
I really need Paris
to bring me back on track.

354
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,425
Tino's always made me
feel comfortable

355
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,728
and confident
in our relationship.

356
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,264
What do you think
about chocolate?

357
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,898
- Bring it on.
- So hopefully Tino's

358
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,735
the perfect partner
to experience Paris with

359
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,803
and to help me put
that fear behind me.

360
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,171
- I got you, you're good.

361
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,173
- Ooh!
- Bonjour.

362
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,241
- Bonjour.

363
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,310
- Jason.
- Jason.

364
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,178
Jason, oui, oui.

365
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,389
That's all I know how to say.

366
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,081
Oui, oui.
- Oui, oui.

367
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,252
I picked Jason for my date today

368
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,389
because he is really,
really shy.

369
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,225
And I did want to wait
until I felt

370
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,826
he was in a comfortable position

371
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,862
so he could really
open up to me.

372
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,732
Are you having fun, though?

373
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,034
Do you hate it here?

374
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,368
- No, I actually love Paris.

375
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,113
This is the best thing
that could have happened.

376
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,271
- Really?
- Yeah.

377
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,140
- Yeah, 'cause where else
have you been?

378
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,776
- I've been to France,
actually, but not Paris.

379
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,544
- Oh.

380
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,380
The last time we went,
I was with all my girlfriends,

381
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,258
and we have a picture
in front of the Eiffel Tower.

382
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,052
There's, like, eight of us
with matching Paris shirts.

383
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,987
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

384
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,157
- This is my first time
in Paris.

385
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,693
I'm so excited.

386
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,998
- Jason is a man of few words.

387
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,976
That's one of the first things
I noticed about him

388
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,336
and one of the things that
I was really attracted to.

389
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,472
He's never been
to the most romantic city,

390
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,774
so I feel grateful that
I get to share that with him.

391
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,812
But I also hope today
he could try in his own way

392
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,980
to break out of his shell
a little more.

393
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,047
- We need hats.
- Bonjour.

394
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,083
- Hi.

395
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,951
How are you?
- Fine, and you?

396
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,186
- Good.

397
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,530
They're gonna measure our heads.

398
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,223
- Yes.
- I'm so stoked for this.

399
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,495
- Is that big or small?

400
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:23,863
So you're a small.

401
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,065
- 56 centimeters.
- Oh, my God, I'm flattered.

402
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,968
- Oh.
- You're an extra large.

403
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,670
Exactly, exactly.

404
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,038
Yeah.

405
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,248
- You pick one for me.
- This is a hard decision.

406
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,440
Okay.

407
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,876
I feel like I need a baguette
ASAP.

408
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,678
Yes.

409
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,046
- What is this thing?

410
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,547
- Oh, no!
- Okay.

411
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,417
- I don't know about this.
- I think you need a cap.

412
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,619
- Can you fit it
over this thing?

413
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,488
I'm gonna look bald.

414
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,323
- It's more like a hat,
you know,

415
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,724
it's a big beret.
- Oh, no!

416
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,826
Obviously, I didn't wear
the right hairstyle

417
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,128
to look good in a beret.

418
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,964
I look like maybe a bald baby,

419
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,566
that queen from "Snow White."

420
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,168
A chef.

421
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,936
Anything but good.

422
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,471
- Now you look French.

423
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,340
- Perfect.
- Actually, I like this one.

424
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,008
I actually like this one.

425
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,244
- Have you had a crepe yet?
- No, this looks so good.

426
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,246
- This is so hard to eat.

427
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,747
This'll look really sexy.

428
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,893
You look really cute.

429
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:22,989
- Oh.
- Do you want to go make one?

430
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,090
- Definitely.

431
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,825
- Absolutely.

432
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,493
It's cold.
- I got you.

433
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,828
- Oh, thank you.

434
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:29,829
Press it.

435
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:30,930
- Press it.

436
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,107
Rachel, you want to go for it?

437
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,299
- Okay.

438
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,768
- Two fingers like this.
- Okay.

439
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:36,936
- Perfect.
- It's burning.

440
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,206
- Being in Paris
and getting to explore

441
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,976
such a romantic city in the rain

442
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,179
with literally, like,

443
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,515
the most amazing girl
I've ever met,

444
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:52,819
I mean, I'm just, like,
I'm on cloud nine.

445
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,655
I just... I can't imagine
a better day.

446
00:15:56,856 --> 00:16:00,126
To see her get hurt last week
by people sitting on the fence

447
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:04,630
or not as sure as me, like,
it's just... like, it sucks.

448
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:05,832
I hate seeing her sad.

449
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,268
She's the most stunning girl
I've ever

450
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,670
gotten to spend time with.

451
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,671
And...

452
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,905
After you, beautiful.

453
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,007
I don't want her
to ever not be happy.

454
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,109
- Bonjour.

455
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,045
- It's weird,
it's been so long, like,

456
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,248
kind of being like this,
like, with somebody.

457
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,850
- Really?

458
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:28,488
- Like, this, like,
excited about it, yeah.

459
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,323
- Why?

460
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,433
- 'Cause you're so charming.

461
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,025
- Ooh, I like it.
Tell me more.

462
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,470
- Have you been told
that you're charming?

463
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,494
- No.

464
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,442
- You make
the rainy days in Paris...

465
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,710
- More rainy?
- Sunny, sunny!

466
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:55,481
You bring sunshine
to rainy days in Paris.

467
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,083
- Oh, oui, oui.
- Cheers.

468
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,051
I was hoping to have
a date with Gabby

469
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,620
away from a big group.

470
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,422
And the fact
that the stars aligned

471
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,691
for Gabby and I
to come to Paris together

472
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,094
and get this date
is everything to me.

473
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,395
That one, this one!

474
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,163
- No, no, it's going so fast!
- Go, go!

475
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,301
- Jason and I just
have fun goofing around

476
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,304
and act like kids together,

477
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,673
which I personally love.

478
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,910
Jason is somebody that I
can kind of feel their warmth

479
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,013
and we don't always
have to be talking.

480
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,981
But I do kind of need him

481
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,917
to open up
a little bit more to me

482
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,919
because we don't have
a ton of time

483
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,186
to learn about each other.

484
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,323
And that's what these
one-on-one dates are for.

485
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,158
- This is, like,
the cutest little street.

486
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,228
- Oh, my God, I love
little bookstores like that.

487
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,138
Kissing Tino in the rain,

488
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:57,310
I feel excited again
after a really hard week.

489
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,413
I see why they call Paris
the city of love.

490
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,549
It does something to you.

491
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,484
I can't explain it.

492
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:10,456
I really don't want this day
to end at all.

493
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,392
It really feels like
a fairy tale.

494
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,364
- How was your date?

495
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,775
- It was good!
- What'd you guys do?

496
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,079
- We tried on berets.
- Carousel.

497
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,034
Oh, we got hats.
- That was second.

498
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,302
- Did they measure your heads?

499
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,013
- Yes, she's a medium.
- He's an extra large.

500
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,172
I'm a medium.
- Small.

501
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,740
I got, like, a star hat.

502
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,575
- Gabs, do you have to go
to the bathroom?

503
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:30,643
- Yeah.
- Okay.

504
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,645
- Okay, good. Okay.
- Bye.

505
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,780
- Please move.
- Sorry, sorry.

506
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,651
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

507
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:39,785
- Tell me.
- How was it?

508
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,054
No, you go first.

509
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,289
I'm in love.

510
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:46,692
Oh!

511
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:47,760
- What do you...

512
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:48,761
- It went well, man.

513
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,229
Like, it went really well.

514
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,098
I haven't had that much fun
in a while.

515
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,266
- Yeah.
- Like, she's just fun,

516
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,837
and, like,
effortless to be with.

517
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,739
- Yeah.

518
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,116
- Yeah, I'm feeling good
about it, so.

519
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,308
- Same here.

520
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,876
- Hmm.
- I love that.

521
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:04,877
- Me too.

522
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,512
It really was, like, magical.

523
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,913
- But that's so good.

524
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,050
- Yeah, it is, but we
didn't get into anything deep.

525
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,361
- Mm-hmm, same.
- We, like, talked about

526
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,686
surface level stuff,

527
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,788
so I'm excited to just,
like, know more about him.

528
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,657
But tell me about you.

529
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,859
- I already liked him so much.
- Yeah.

530
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,260
- We had such
a great connection.

531
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,996
And then today,
it was just so amazing.

532
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:27,166
- Mm-hmm.
- And I'm so scared.

533
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,734
- Yeah.
- I was not

534
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,636
expecting today to go
as go... like,

535
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,905
Paris is just insane.

536
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,373
It does something to you.

537
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,475
- Yeah, it really does.
- Mm-hmm.

538
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,477
- But it's okay to be scared.

539
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,280
Like, I feel like
he likes you so, so much.

540
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,616
- Tino and I had
such an amazing date.

541
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,418
I think it
was absolutely perfect.

542
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,820
And so now I am feeling
really strong feelings for him,

543
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,656
and I'm not sure
how to handle them.

544
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:53,626
To feel feelings this strong
this early on,

545
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,563
it's terrifying
because I have been through

546
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,465
so much rejection in the past.

547
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:03,836
And, like, if Tino does
the same thing to me,

548
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,238
that would be ten times worse.

549
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,841
Of course,
I don't want that to happen.

550
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:11,277
So tonight,
I'm really looking to see

551
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,279
if we do fit into
each other's lives,

552
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,948
because I want to make sure
that going forward,

553
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,284
every single rose I hand out
is to someone

554
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,020
that I genuinely could see
being my husband.

555
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,122
- Before we jump in,

556
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:26,058
I know the Rose Ceremony
was hard last week

557
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,962
and didn't go smoothly
by any means.

558
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:31,731
No.

559
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,833
No, thank you for checking in.

560
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,069
It truly was, like,
the hardest moment

561
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,370
I've had as the Bachelorette.

562
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,373
And... ah, it's, like,
so hard to talk about.

563
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,608
It's like, you stand up there

564
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:43,943
and you are so vulnerable,

565
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,078
and to have people
just so blatantly

566
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:48,314
not care about
how it would affect me.

567
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,717
And I think it has to do
with me being, like,

568
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,953
a little insecure, I guess,

569
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,521
because no one really wants
to feel...

570
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,223
- Yeah.
- Like they're rejected.

571
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,567
And obviously,
I've had some, like,

572
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,226
tough relationships in the past.

573
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,027
- I mean, it's... it's never easy,

574
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,363
like, hearing any sort
of news like that.

575
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,499
And I'm sure that was,
you know, uncomfortable

576
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,735
or, you know,
probably a little bit scary.

577
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:13,606
- Yeah, it was definitely...
It was tough.

578
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,275
But I did kind of want
to talk today about

579
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,511
aligning, like,
on career and family

580
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,045
because it's kind of, like,

581
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,914
a reason my last relationship
failed.

582
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,116
- Mm-hmm.
- I had a boyfriend

583
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,285
who just wasn't supportive
of my career,

584
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,621
which is a really big fear
of mine.

585
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,990
I feel like when people
first meet me,

586
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,259
it's, "Oh, you're...
That's so cool."

587
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,395
This is, like, a job
that not a lot of people have.

588
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,130
And then when you get into it

589
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,232
and they start to realize,
like, okay...

590
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,103
At least my last boyfriend,
when things got serious,

591
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,205
he would get,
like, really scared.

592
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,440
Like, he would be like,
"Well, pilots cheat,

593
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,842
"and you will be away.

594
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:52,344
"And there will be times
where I'll have to

595
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,980
"take care of the kids for,
like, a day that you're gone

596
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,458
and you're not
always gonna be there."

597
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,692
- Right.
- And of course, kind of

598
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,718
reaffirmed what
everyone's always told me,

599
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,596
which is that when you're
a woman in this field...

600
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,755
- Mm-hmm.
- You can't have

601
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,223
the traditional family life.

602
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,325
But I think it can work.

603
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:07,593
- I totally understand that.

604
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,828
I mean, that is...

605
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,596
It's really tough.

606
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,165
In my industry, a lot of people
get married young

607
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:16,602
and then, like, the tolls of
long hours and stuff like that.

608
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,837
- Yeah.

609
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,281
- But your passion
for your career is just,

610
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,841
like, it lights me up inside

611
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:25,244
because like, I need somebody
who has that kind of devotion,

612
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:29,148
like... but equal to, like,
the relationship working.

613
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:32,451
And that's what, like,
I want to be for somebody.

614
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,854
- And you do want a family?

615
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,555
- Yeah.

616
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,557
Is that a deal breaker for you?

617
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:39,625
No, I do.

618
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:40,626
- That's something that's, like,

619
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,194
really important for me.

620
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,195
- It's kind of what I was hoping

621
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:44,563
for you to say.
- Yeah.

622
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,941
It does make me really happy.
- I couldn't agree more.

623
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,967
I mean, this was, like,

624
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,835
a conversation I was, like,
really scared of

625
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:51,179
'cause, like,
I don't... I don't know,

626
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,280
like, I mean,
you could have said,

627
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,624
like,
"Oh, I don't want a family."

628
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,841
And, you know, we just had,
like, an amazing day,

629
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,219
and I would've been like...
- I know.

630
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:59,378
- Oh, wow, that's a lot, yeah.
- No, I really do.

631
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,413
- So...
- Like, I really want a family,

632
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,982
and I really want
to get married.

633
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,651
Like, I really want both.
- 100%.

634
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,520
I mean, I can't... I can't,
like, promise you

635
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,222
it'll always be easy.
- Mm-hmm.

636
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,958
- But I totally see it
being possible.

637
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:15,127
Like, I always had parents

638
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,862
that both worked full time

639
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:19,865
and made sacrifices
and commitments

640
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,200
to me and my little brothers.

641
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:23,569
I mean, there was so much
partnership when I was

642
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,838
growing up where they always
supported each other.

643
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,406
That's, like,
the only thing I know.

644
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:30,442
My dad did work the long hours,
but he would get up early

645
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,977
to make us lunches and stuff,

646
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:34,013
and, like, that... those kind
of little things

647
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,515
really speak on, like,
how I'm programmed

648
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,959
that there's always a way
to make it work.

649
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,084
- Yeah.

650
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,719
- And I mean,
with the right person,

651
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,856
I mean, there's just
no other way around it.

652
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:47,259
- Yeah, I can... I really
can tell you're serious,

653
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:52,164
and I really think
I needed today

654
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:55,367
to get back on track
and truly feel like

655
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,368
this is working for me.

656
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,805
And I really, really do.

657
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,608
I really like you,
and that scares me,

658
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:06,645
'cause it is really early,
and I want to make sure

659
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,948
that we're on the same page.

660
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,849
- I wouldn't keep
accepting roses from you

661
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,252
if I wasn't, like, willing
to go... go to war for it

662
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,587
and didn't see that potential.

663
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,890
- That means a lot.

664
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,591
- Happy to say it.

665
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,427
It's terrifying for me, too, so.

666
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,428
- Yeah, I know.

667
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,196
It's... it's really scary.

668
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:51,390
I truly did not know

669
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:53,726
if I could get to this point
last week.

670
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,596
You truly have turned
this around for me,

671
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:01,200
and this is the easiest rose
I've had to give.

672
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,969
So, Tino...

673
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,637
will you accept this rose?

674
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,539
- Always.

675
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,855
Today has been
absolutely perfect,

676
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,025
and tonight somehow
has even been better,

677
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,561
because this rose means
that she sees a future with me.

678
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,631
And I really do think
I was meant

679
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,634
to find this girl
and make her happy forever.

680
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,870
So it's like falling
in love with Rachel

681
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,205
is coming faster than I could
have ever imagined.

682
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,975
- This is perfect.

683
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,576
- It really is.

684
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,049
- Paris with Tino was definitely

685
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:53,152
the restart that I needed.

686
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,587
I had high hopes for our date,

687
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:59,358
but all my expectations
were exceeded.

688
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:02,161
He's just so amazing.

689
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,764
I think I'm definitely going
to fall in love with Tino.

690
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,042
- What do you guys think
of the ship?

691
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,043
- I like this.

692
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,278
Yeah.

693
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,889
- We got our own bar here,
we got our own

694
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:21,847
bachelor pad down here, kind of.

695
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,082
- Yeah, yeah.

696
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,359
Kind of like a little clubhouse.

697
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,027
- Yeah, we have our own...
- Rachel clubhouse.

698
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,086
- Balcony over there.

699
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,087
We can kind of go outside
if we want.

700
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,088
- Yeah.

701
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,089
- The reality is, like,

702
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,290
now it actually starts.

703
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,991
- Yeah.
Definitely a new chapter.

704
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,927
- And now there's nine of us.
- Nine of us.

705
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,162
We all get to be intentional
with Gabby.

706
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,032
- The date card.

707
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,333
- I got it.

708
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,877
It's really interesting
to see this group

709
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,236
compared to Rachel's because

710
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,939
I think we are significantly
more competitive.

711
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,516
I don't know how the group
dates are gonna work,

712
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,442
but I think it's gonna
get intense very quickly

713
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:53,545
because we're all
laser-focused on Gabby.

714
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,917
Nate.

715
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,752
Kirk.

716
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,688
Quincey.

717
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,289
Erich.

718
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,358
Michael.

719
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,293
Mario.

720
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,129
Spencer.

721
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,930
And Johnny.

722
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,334
"Love conquers all,
but not without a fight.

723
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,502
Love, Gabby."
- Oh!

724
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,203
- Oh!

725
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,205
- Big fight.
- Something competitive.

726
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:21,206
- Not without a fight.

727
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:22,207
- We're fighting
for Gabby's love.

728
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,208
- Yeah.
- I mean,

729
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:24,209
I'ma bring it, I guess,

730
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,320
whatever we're doing, but...

731
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:26,778
- Let's see some blood.
- Yeah.

732
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:29,047
- We're probably gonna get
down and dirty tomorrow,

733
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:32,851
but all I know is Gabby is
absolutely worth fighting for.

734
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,788
- Did you have a good break?

735
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,524
- Yeah, I took two showers.

736
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,758
- These European showers

737
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,102
are sometimes hard
to figure out.

738
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,662
They always stop at 38 Celsius.

739
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:46,165
And I'm like, hotter!

740
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,833
- I think Jason and I
are more alike

741
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,234
than what we seem,

742
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,737
which is why
I am so drawn to him.

743
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,305
There's something about him

744
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,440
that makes me feel
really at ease.

745
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,742
Oh, thank you.

746
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,178
Going into tonight,
I'm just hoping

747
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,113
that we find some solid ground

748
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,483
to bond us together
to help me decide,

749
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,452
are we as compatible
as I hope we are?

750
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,259
I...

751
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,562
am, like...

752
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:19,598
I feel like
you're pretty reserved.

753
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:21,266
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

754
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:25,237
- Yeah, no, I was... yeah,
it's like, really...

755
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:28,740
Like, I'm typically
a pretty private guy.

756
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,442
- Yeah.
- And it's hard for me

757
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:34,746
to open up unless I'm in, like,
a comfortable situation.

758
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,782
- Yeah.
- And this is, like, completely

759
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,450
out of my comfort zone.
- Yeah, yeah.

760
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,385
- Like, like,
to be honest, like,

761
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:44,356
I got here
and was seriously overwhelmed.

762
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:45,958
- Yeah, I bet.
- And I didn't realize

763
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,659
how crazy that house
would be and, like,

764
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,163
I didn't eat for... or sleep
for, like, three days.

765
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,864
- Oh, totally, yeah.

766
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,032
- And then I was like,

767
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,534
I can't do this.

768
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:58,036
- Yeah.
- And, yeah, it was like,

769
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,905
I almost had, like,
a breakdown... or I did.

770
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,140
Oh, you're telling me, yeah.

771
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,775
Welcome.
- And, um, yeah.

772
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,812
And I think I'm,
like, a highly sensitive,

773
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,047
like, person in terms
of energy because like...

774
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,316
- Yeah.
- Um...

775
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,320
I feel like growing up,
I was always, like...

776
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:19,191
Like as a kid, I would look
at my friends and, like...

777
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,629
I don't know, I just always
felt like I wasn't

778
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,298
good enough, in a way.

779
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,033
It was just kind of hard.
- Yeah.

780
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,577
- And then I would try
to prove myself

781
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,404
with, like, tennis and, like,
try to win and stuff.

782
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:33,405
- Yeah.
- And then I started

783
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,307
to hate tennis and then I quit.

784
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:38,310
- Yeah.
- So that kind of, like,

785
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:41,179
I think is why it takes me,
like, a little bit more

786
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,557
to open up to people.
- Of course.

787
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,316
- 'Cause, like,
I think I, you know,

788
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,451
took ev...
Took everything personally

789
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:49,021
and just, like, kept it
inside of me because of that.

790
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,422
Years and years of that.

791
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:51,657
- Totally.

792
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,993
- And now as, like, an adult,

793
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,663
through therapy,
I've, like, figured out

794
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,665
to, like, speak up
for what I want.

795
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:00,732
- Yeah.
- And, like,

796
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,200
it's like, helped
with everything

797
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,536
in my life from, like, work,
friends, and relationships.

798
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,471
Every aspect of my life.
- Oh, that's amazing.

799
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:07,906
- Like, I have my power again.

800
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,441
- Yeah.
- And feel... and, like,

801
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,443
it's something, like, as a kid

802
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,146
that I wish I knew
and, like, wish I had, and...

803
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,614
- Yeah, but...
- I don't even know

804
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,916
if I'm making sense.
- No, you are, and I...

805
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,418
- I'm in this environment,
I'm like,

806
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,119
what do I even say?
- No, you really are.

807
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,322
And I think, like, I have, like,

808
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:26,525
a little bit
of a similar experience.

809
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:31,163
My, like, mom and I
are estranged.

810
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,732
She didn't have the capacity

811
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:37,636
to kind of, like,
love me as a kid.

812
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:40,872
And she was, like,
really quick to take away love.

813
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,775
Like, oh, you know,
if you don't do this and that,

814
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,286
like, you'll have to go
live with your dad.

815
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,446
And it's like, I don't
ever want to lose my mom.

816
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,047
Like, that was so scary for me.

817
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,483
And then when I left
for college,

818
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,819
she, like,
washed her hands of me

819
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:57,723
and didn't want anything
to do with me.

820
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,225
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It's okay.

821
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,127
But through a ton of therapy,

822
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,762
I've kind of had to learn

823
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,965
how... really how to allow
people to love me,

824
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:10,969
because I never had an example
of receiving it as a child.

825
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,672
And, like, I think
the hardest part

826
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:17,242
is, like, I, like,
love her, like, so much.

827
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:20,345
But, you know,
you can't always...

828
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:22,681
Like, she just can't
be in my life.

829
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:26,785
She just doesn't have
the tools to love me back.

830
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,820
- Damn, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

831
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,724
It's honestly, like, I've had,
like, so much anxiety from it,

832
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,527
but from that, I've built,
like, a ton of humor,

833
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:38,563
and I think I have a lot
of grace for other people.

834
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,232
- Mm-hmm.
- But it's really hard

835
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,134
with dating, and I have, like,

836
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,770
a lot of fears, honestly.

837
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,239
- Have you ever heard
of, like, inner child work?

838
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,241
- Yeah, like,
to reparent yourself and stuff.

839
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,276
- Yeah, exactly.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

840
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,344
- It's changed my life.

841
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,146
- It's really rare to meet a man

842
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,114
who appreciates therapy.
- Yeah, I know.

843
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,749
- Because I feel like
you understand.

844
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,084
So, like, when Hayden was like,

845
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:00,161
"You're rough around the edges,"

846
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:03,355
I was like, to you, yeah, I am.

847
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:04,465
- Because...
- Yeah.

848
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,824
You're a ass bitch.

849
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:07,626
But, like,

850
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:10,462
that is what
I was terrified of hearing.

851
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,831
Like, something about me
is wrong,

852
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,700
and I am too rough and tough.

853
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,436
- Yeah, and, like,
he doesn't deserve

854
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,037
for you to open up to him.

855
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,672
Like, those are his issues...
- Yeah.

856
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:22,073
- He's projecting onto you.

857
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,875
- Yeah, absolutely.

858
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:28,079
Honestly, I knew there
was something about you,

859
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:31,082
and that was, like,
my intuition, I think.

860
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:33,418
And I'm really glad,
like, I listened to it,

861
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:37,255
and I feel like this is, like,
all the validation I need.

862
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,491
- Yeah, I'm...

863
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:40,992
I'm glad you listened to it.

864
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,527
Yeah.

865
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:45,430
- 'Cause I had good intuition
about you too.

866
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,141
Like, sometimes you just
have to trust even though...

867
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,900
- Yeah, yeah.

868
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,836
- It's hard.
- It is so hard.

869
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:54,372
- Yeah.
- But this is, like, so good.

870
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,174
- Yeah, I agree.

871
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,787
- Tonight, Jason tells me that

872
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:11,323
he has been in therapy
to just help him through

873
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:14,092
some things that he's
been through in his life.

874
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,328
It feels really good
to know that he is

875
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,864
kind of on the same,
like, life path as me.

876
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,468
Do you want to go outside?

877
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:27,439
I'd love to go outside.

878
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,242
- I see a lot of myself
in Jason.

879
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,781
A lot of things
that I didn't know

880
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,317
I would ever see
in somebody else.

881
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,687
I feel really grateful
that it was you today.

882
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,656
I don't just, like,
want to give you a rose.

883
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:49,528
I want to give you that belief
that this could go somewhere.

884
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:53,899
So, Jason,
will you accept this rose?

885
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,134
- Of course, I would love
to accept this rose.

886
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,874
- This was just what I needed
to keep moving forward.

887
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,075
It's, like, I never thought

888
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:09,247
I would be able or deserving
to find someone.

889
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:12,450
And, like, now it's
right in front of my face.

890
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,587
It is, like,
such a beautiful moment.

891
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:18,723
Like, I never thought
this day would come.

892
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,259
I just can't believe
I'm so lucky.

893
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:34,105
- One, two.

894
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,532
- Oh, we definitely
throwing hands.

895
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,708
- Oh.
- Oh, my goodness.

896
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,276
Oh.
- Oh.

897
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:39,878
- This is my first
group date alone

898
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,680
where they're all my boyfriends.

899
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,715
I'm just excited
to spend time with them

900
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,884
and have this new experience
with them.

901
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,752
They chose me.

902
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,120
Hi, everyone.

903
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,388
- Hi.
- How are you?

904
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,490
- I see Gabby atop
this boxing ring,

905
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,468
and she's, like, throwing
some kicks and punches.

906
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,670
And I'm just like, oh, my God.

907
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:56,962
One, she's beautiful.

908
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,697
Two, definitely makes it
worth the wait.

909
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,865
- Today,
we're actually going to be

910
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:05,103
practicing the art
of French boxing, or savate.

911
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,505
I brought two friends in
to help.

912
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,342
Haifa and her husband, Kareem.

913
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,444
- Gabby is looking for someone

914
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,646
who's willing to fight
for her love.

915
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:17,282
You will be competing,
one against another.

916
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:18,617
- Oh, God.
- Head to head

917
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,051
in a boxing match.

918
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,020
We will ask you
to share with her

919
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:24,489
why you are
the perfect match for her.

920
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:25,490
- All right.

921
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:27,359
- Gabby?

922
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,427
- I've decided that tonight,

923
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:32,564
there will be
a special dinner with me

924
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,766
and just one other person.

925
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:38,003
And there will be
a rose as well.

926
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,404
- All right.

927
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,474
- Breaking the guns out
today, baby.

928
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,243
I think it's time to finally
get that one-on-one time.

929
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,310
Gabby, this is for you.

930
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,489
- Allez, go, go, go!

931
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,190
- Punch, punch, punch, punch!

932
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,258
- Two!

933
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,626
Three!

934
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,328
Four!
- Oh, it's burning!

935
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:05,063
- 20 seconds, don't give up.

936
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,631
- The last time
I talked to Gabby

937
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,767
was the second Rose Ceremony,
which was...

938
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,068
Like, it's been a long time.

939
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:11,545
- Jump!
- I don't... I have absolutely

940
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:12,737
no clue where I stand.

941
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:15,140
I need to go as hard
as I possibly can.

942
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,709
I want her to see
how serious I am

943
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:19,411
and hopefully get
that one-on-one.

944
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,046
- Pom, pom, pom, stay up.

945
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,180
- Oh, god, no.

946
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,882
- Pom, pom, pom.

947
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,884
- I'm trying
to stand out for Gabby.

948
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,687
I'm a competitor,
so hopefully she notices today.

949
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,056
Only one person is gonna get
that time with her tonight.

950
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,458
I know guys are gonna be
putting in 100%.

951
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,826
- I think it's much better

952
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:37,062
that you can focus on, like,
a select group of guys

953
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,572
instead of trying
to go through people

954
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,066
who are, like, wishy-washy,
which isn't fair to you.

955
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,400
- Yeah, Totally.
No, thank you.

956
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,502
I didn't, like,
want to be too dramatic,

957
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,371
but Rachel and I have just
been going through

958
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:48,206
so much last week, but...
- Yeah.

959
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:50,175
- But I'm excited
to kind of explore.

960
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,385
- Same.
- I think it'll be fun.

961
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,379
- Me too. I miss you.

962
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:56,281
- I think I'm worth
fighting for,

963
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,149
and I'm seeing men fight for me

964
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,151
in their subtle
and different ways,

965
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,353
and it definitely
doesn't go unnoticed.

966
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,455
- It looks like you guys

967
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,865
are tickling each other.
- Oh, I know.

968
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,126
- And I think they are
in it for the long haul.

969
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:10,361
They're here kind of
for the right reasons,

970
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,996
that they're dedicated.

971
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:15,467
- I need an oxygen tank.

972
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,405
- Right now,
I just feel so hopeful.

973
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:23,274
My date with Tino
went really well.

974
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,276
He truly has
turned it around for me.

975
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:28,480
And now I'm so excited
to see my guys.

976
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,716
I haven't seen these guys
in at least a couple days,

977
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:34,018
so I've got
a little surprise today.

978
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,321
- Whoo! Bring out the boys!

979
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,324
- Bring on the men.

980
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,193
- I'm taking them
on Gabby's date.

981
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,595
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

982
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,097
- It's a chance to have
a little interaction

983
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:47,866
or a little conversation

984
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,667
before our own group date
tomorrow.

985
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,114
- So we do our walkouts,

986
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:05,083
and they've got people
in the stands.

987
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,285
And then there's all
Rachel's guys down there too.

988
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:09,454
- Whoo!

989
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,723
- And Rachel's there,
like, oh, my God,

990
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,024
this is, like, ridiculous.

991
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,434
Yeah!

992
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,271
- Let's get it on!

993
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,607
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

994
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,176
- It's good to see you guys.

995
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,177
- Hey.
- Miss you guys.

996
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,411
- Good to see you.

997
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,746
- My boys are being so aggro.

998
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,214
Not one of them looked at me.

999
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:37,348
Look at them.

1000
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:38,550
Look at the eyelines.

1001
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,318
Someone look at me.

1002
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:41,619
One of you look at me.

1003
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,397
I'm trying... I'm literally
trying to look at them.

1004
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,756
Tino's up,
jumping in the corner.

1005
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:45,757
- No.

1006
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,692
- Yes!

1007
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:53,064
- Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Nate versus Erich.

1008
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,399
- I've had to go a couple days

1009
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,434
without this amazing lady.

1010
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,803
And there's a few things
that I've realized

1011
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,538
that I can't bear to miss
anymore.

1012
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:03,575
Like the way you cross
your legs when you stand.

1013
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:04,843
Oh!

1014
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,911
- How you look down
when you think pensively.

1015
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:10,193
- And the way you do
this cute little head shake

1016
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:11,716
when you start to talk.

1017
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:13,451
I pay attention to everything.

1018
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,196
And that's something
I will continue to do.

1019
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,888
Wow.

1020
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:24,929
- All right, Gabby.

1021
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:27,465
When I love, I love
unconditionally and deeply.

1022
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:28,843
And I don't let
a lot of people in...

1023
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,101
- Gabby's guys

1024
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,170
are professing
these feelings for her

1025
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,705
and giving her
these big speeches.

1026
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:34,706
And the whole time, no one

1027
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,374
can make eye contact with me.

1028
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:39,143
As much as Gabby was having
a moment with her guys,

1029
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,145
I wanted to have a moment
with mine

1030
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,214
or, like, just say something
or make eye contact.

1031
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:45,917
No one looked at me, no one
sat by me, no one did anything.

1032
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,556
- Erich working the body.

1033
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:53,124
A lot of body blows.

1034
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:54,826
- I did not think
I would end up here

1035
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,228
watching some of my friends
duke it out.

1036
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:59,530
You know,
I am happy to see them.

1037
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:03,902
But also, it's the first time
I've seen Gabby in a while.

1038
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:08,806
It definitely brought up
some old feelings.

1039
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,642
I'm worried that I find myself

1040
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,177
still kind of looking
to the other side.

1041
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,147
- Johnny versus Michael!

1042
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:19,050
Oh, big headshot!

1043
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:21,486
- After the last Rose Ceremony,

1044
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:24,155
watching man after man
reject me...

1045
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,423
- Michael!

1046
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,058
- I think everyone
should have been

1047
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,160
trying so hard
to have a moment with me.

1048
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:31,262
- Quincey and Mario.

1049
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,365
- Dude!

1050
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,467
- It really just does
feel like a big insecurity

1051
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,202
that continues to reveal itself.

1052
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,072
The wanting to have someone
who makes you feel

1053
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,607
like you're the only person here

1054
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:45,043
and that they're
100% invested in you.

1055
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,880
- Gabby, if I get down
on one knee for you,

1056
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:52,183
I have to get back up and fight.

1057
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,352
And that's
what I'm gonna do today.

1058
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:57,588
- I've been through
so much rejection.

1059
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:01,359
It's really easy to get down
on yourself and feel unwanted.

1060
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:03,561
- Gabby,
I would love to laugh together

1061
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,129
for a lifetime with you.

1062
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:09,567
- No one cares.

1063
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,470
Oh!

1064
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,405
- Today just made it that much

1065
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:19,010
more apparent to me that I just
have no idea where anyone is.

1066
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:23,548
- Tonight, I'm awarding
this big fat belt...

1067
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,616
- I'm by myself
as Gabby's up there.

1068
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,752
Feels like
no one's trying at all.

1069
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,988
- To Spencer.

1070
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:37,695
- I'm having too many
of these moments.

1071
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,133
It's like, how much more
can I take?

1072
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,768
No one cares.

1073
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:44,769
- Wow.
- Hey!

1074
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,137
- I'm proud of you.

1075
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,124
- You did good out there,
you did good out there.

1076
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,178
- My boy.
- Appreciate you.

1077
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,847
- I'm so done.

1078
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:05,123
- I really appreciate you,

1079
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,824
like, choosing,
like, me to come.

1080
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,593
- You tried really hard,

1081
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:09,903
and that's what matters.
- Thank you.

1082
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,372
That is what matters.
- That's why you're here.

1083
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:14,198
Tonight, I'm spending
the evening with Spencer.

1084
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,967
He's tall, dark, and handsome.

1085
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,536
And he's been in the military.

1086
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:21,839
Coming from a military family,
I find that pretty attractive.

1087
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,709
- I really enjoyed,
like, my... my service.

1088
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:25,919
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't... I think...

1089
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,245
Did your dad, right?
- Mm-hmm.

1090
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:30,481
- There's a lot of things
people can do to better,

1091
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,825
you know, the world around them.

1092
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,718
And that was just
kind of my path.

1093
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:36,621
You know,
I felt kind of indebted to...

1094
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,523
- Wow, not a lot of people
feel like that.

1095
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,590
That's really special.

1096
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:40,897
- I appreciate you saying that.

1097
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,260
- Growing up
in a military family,

1098
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,095
I feel like
it really is special.

1099
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:45,096
- Yeah.

1100
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:46,564
- After the group date,

1101
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:50,535
I feel kind of just rejuvenated.

1102
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:51,803
I feel like I'm truly building

1103
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:55,006
these really strong connections.

1104
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:01,446
- Right now, I feel
so disappointed and hurt.

1105
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:05,183
Today was Gabby's date and it
was all about her and her guys.

1106
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,553
But my guys
were totally ignoring me.

1107
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,322
They were in their own world
with their own friends.

1108
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:13,057
- Spencer came out hot.

1109
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:14,759
Two big punches,

1110
00:43:14,826 --> 00:43:17,395
and then Kirk just... was just
like, what is going on?

1111
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,865
- And after that last
Rose Ceremony,

1112
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,834
like, it really is
tough because I just

1113
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,802
genuinely feel like
no one's here for me.

1114
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,580
- Yeah, it just feels
li... it feels like a lifetime

1115
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,604
since we've actually had

1116
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:28,849
some real time with her.
- Yeah.

1117
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:31,142
- Last time we saw her
was what, in LA?

1118
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:32,143
- The Rose Ceremony.

1119
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,211
- Yeah.
- In LA.

1120
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,979
- We saw her tonight, didn't we?

1121
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:36,681
- Oh, well, not tonight,
before that.

1122
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,282
Before tonight.

1123
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:41,519
- At this point,
I want to feel chosen.

1124
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:46,424
I'm not here to beg these guys
to act like they want me.

1125
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:49,227
- I think walking into the room
after last Rose Ceremony,

1126
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,963
I kind of felt
kind of elated in a sense.

1127
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:54,932
- Yeah.
- I felt having been chosen,

1128
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,034
which I feel really,
really lucky.

1129
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,870
And that means a lot.

1130
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:04,542
- I'm just so over
feeling like this.

1131
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:07,812
It's, like...

1132
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,152
I don't know why
I feel more insecure,

1133
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:17,021
more desperate on the side
of being the Bachelorette

1134
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:20,158
than I did on the side
of being a contestant

1135
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:21,425
on Clayton's season.

1136
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,828
Truly, he made me feel
more wanted

1137
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:26,030
than these guys make me feel.

1138
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,944
- You know, seeing the rest
of the guys was really cool.

1139
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,603
- Yeah.
- Looking forward to tomorrow

1140
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,381
and kind of compete and get in
after with you guys.

1141
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:35,716
- I hope
it's something competitive

1142
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,108
like the other guys did.

1143
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,676
- Truly, it hurts your feelings

1144
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:43,014
'cause you're supposed to be
the only thing they care about.

1145
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,550
I feel like Gabby's guys get it.

1146
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,052
This is such a roller coaster.

1147
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,687
Like, every day, it's like

1148
00:44:49,754 --> 00:44:52,623
a really good day
or a really bad day.

1149
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,601
And I don't know how
I'm supposed to fall in love

1150
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,628
when I'm having mostly bad days.

1151
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,401
I don't feel like I deserve
to be the Bachelorette.

1152
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,340
- We've all been
in the doghouse,

1153
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:11,742
a Rose Ceremony not
going great, you know.

1154
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,053
We're in a new country,

1155
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,712
a new chance for everyone,
really.

1156
00:45:14,779 --> 00:45:16,156
So I'm excited.
- It is, and that's a good...

1157
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,615
That's a great way
to look at it.

1158
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:22,486
- Oh.
- Wow.

1159
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,622
- Oh.

1160
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:25,856
- Whoa.

1161
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,828
- As you guys can see,
I'm pretty upset.

1162
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:36,033
I think I went through a lot
at the last Rose Ceremony

1163
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,501
and I was really looking forward

1164
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,936
to the next time I saw you guys.

1165
00:45:39,003 --> 00:45:41,639
You did accept my rose,
you did tell me

1166
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:44,575
you want to be here,
and I do want you all here.

1167
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:49,347
But you really made me feel
hurt and unseen.

1168
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,782
I want you guys to want
to be here for me,

1169
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,293
and I didn't feel that tonight
at all.

1170
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,686
I felt like I was trying so hard

1171
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,755
to just make eye contact
with someone

1172
00:45:57,822 --> 00:46:00,558
and no one was looking at me,
no one came over.

1173
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:03,327
And every single moment
you get...

1174
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:04,695
We don't get that many.

1175
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,932
So any chance you get
just to have a little moment

1176
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:09,800
could have meant
a lot to me tonight.

1177
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:12,470
I feel like my feelings
are just extremely hurt

1178
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:15,239
and it's hard for me
to sleep on it tonight

1179
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:17,251
and go in tomorrow and pretend
like this didn't happen

1180
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:20,511
because I was upstairs
crying about it.

1181
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:24,215
I just genuinely do want
to have these moments with you

1182
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:27,451
and I haven't seen
a lot of you guys in a while.

1183
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,122
And it's good
to have you guys here,

1184
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,757
but it's just hard for me,

1185
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,760
especially after kind of
what I went through.

1186
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,671
At the end of the day,
this is what we're here for.

1187
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:39,163
So I want to, like,
remind you guys,

1188
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,631
because it did hurt my feelings.

1189
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,078
The shock on their faces.

1190
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,847
No one even knew
what I was coming from.

1191
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,316
No one knew.

1192
00:46:58,382 --> 00:46:59,626
- There was definitely
an opportunity.

1193
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,119
Yeah, I think we that one up.

1194
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:04,221
- I'm just so over this.

1195
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:06,557
I'm so done,
and I hate every single day

1196
00:47:06,624 --> 00:47:10,194
having to get to the point
of wanting to leave.

1197
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:11,729
- Tomorrow's a huge day now.

1198
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:13,597
Even bigger than it was before.

1199
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:27,745
- Today, we are going
on a group date with Rachel.

1200
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:31,482
Last night,
Rachel was very, very upset.

1201
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:33,351
Seeing her that disappointed

1202
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,853
and sad last night, I mean,
that just was a gut punch.

1203
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,923
- Hi, guys.

1204
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,434
- Get in there, dude.
- Absolutely gorgeous, really.

1205
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:41,659
- Thank you.

1206
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:43,060
- It's not a good feeling

1207
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:44,371
seeing the person
that you're dating

1208
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:45,696
with tears in her eyes,

1209
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:48,366
feeling like she wasn't noticed.

1210
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,835
It was a poor reflection
on everybody,

1211
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,803
and I take full fault for that.

1212
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,705
You got to be better.

1213
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:57,241
- In LA, I gave
each one of you a rose

1214
00:47:57,308 --> 00:47:58,876
to come on this journey with me,

1215
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:01,846
and I just really want
to feel chosen back.

1216
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,381
And I didn't yesterday,

1217
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:06,183
and it was tough for me today
to show up.

1218
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,453
And I really want
to move forward

1219
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,855
and I want to get past this.

1220
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,190
And I really hope that today,
you guys can prove

1221
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:16,160
that you do choose me
and you do want to be here.

1222
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,471
So you guys want to head inside?

1223
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:18,429
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

1224
00:48:18,496 --> 00:48:19,663
- All right, let's go.

1225
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,165
- After seeing Gabby
at the fight,

1226
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,534
it put a different context
on today's group date.

1227
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:25,970
I need to find complete clarity

1228
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,671
that Rachel and I have
that kind of

1229
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,641
lightning bolt connection
that can stick.

1230
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:40,184
- Oh, my goodness.

1231
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,958
- There's this French couple.

1232
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,193
They just kept making out.

1233
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:52,873
We just stood there
and were like,

1234
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:54,565
"Do they know we're here?"

1235
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:59,170
Have no idea what we're doing.

1236
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:02,206
So this will be fun
and interesting.

1237
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:05,576
Oh.

1238
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:06,844
- We didn't see you there.

1239
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:08,078
- Bonjour.

1240
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:09,079
Bonjour.

1241
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,448
- Bienvenue.

1242
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:15,119
- So, guys, these are my
two friends, Flora and Boris.

1243
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:17,922
And they are experts
in all things romance.

1244
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:20,858
- Gentlemen,
the French are the most

1245
00:49:20,925 --> 00:49:23,160
romantic people in the world,

1246
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:25,763
and today, we get to experience

1247
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,765
the art of romance.

1248
00:49:27,832 --> 00:49:31,936
- We're gonna take you
through a series of tasks.

1249
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:35,906
- And everything
is for seducing Rachel.

1250
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,675
Don't forget.

1251
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,844
- Today's date is all about

1252
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:43,314
the art of romance
and pursuing your partner.

1253
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,716
- Take a seat.

1254
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:47,418
- And I think today
will put these men

1255
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,453
to the test, French-style.

1256
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,922
- Flirting is
an very important step

1257
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,558
in any romantic relationship.

1258
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,160
- So let's get started.

1259
00:49:56,227 --> 00:49:58,162
Zach.
- I'm up? All right.

1260
00:49:58,229 --> 00:49:59,363
- Thank you.

1261
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,065
- The first task we have to do

1262
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,533
is to flirt with Rachel.

1263
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:07,838
I want to make this
just as perfect as I can.

1264
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:10,975
- Oh!

1265
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,409
- Sorry.
- What are we doing?

1266
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:13,878
- We're gonna dance.
- Okay.

1267
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:16,313
But is this how you
approach people at a bar?

1268
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,715
- Uh...

1269
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:18,959
- Is this how
you flirt with them?

1270
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:20,618
I hope not.

1271
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,486
- Okay.
- Eh...

1272
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:23,864
- What do you guys think
about this?

1273
00:50:23,888 --> 00:50:25,289
- What is that?

1274
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,234
- I... you guys can stop me...
- Is he choking me?

1275
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:28,893
- Oh, am I choking?

1276
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,027
Oh, this is bad.

1277
00:50:30,094 --> 00:50:31,295
We flirted.

1278
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,297
Not well, but it happened.

1279
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:35,966
- Ooh.

1280
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:49,680
- A lot of guys were
kind of grabbing Rachel

1281
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:51,949
and dancing and holding her.

1282
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:53,183
- Oh!
- I don't know.

1283
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,728
I don't think
Rachel was that into it.

1284
00:50:54,752 --> 00:50:56,153
A little awkward.

1285
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,354
- Peter?

1286
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:59,290
- Oh, okay.

1287
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,758
You're only in France once,

1288
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,860
showing off
your flirtatious abilities,

1289
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:05,429
so you gotta go all out.

1290
00:51:14,872 --> 00:51:16,073
- What?
- Oh.

1291
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,311
- Ethan's crawling up to her.

1292
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:21,912
He's giving a lot of energy,

1293
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:23,714
a little sex panther
kind of look going on.

1294
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,253
- Even though I made
a total fool of myself,

1295
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,888
just seeing her smile and laugh,

1296
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:32,256
it made me feel really good.

1297
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,794
- The second test is one by one,

1298
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,397
we have to put on a show
French kissing our own fists.

1299
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:44,368
- Oh, there we go.

1300
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:47,204
- Tongue, lips, teeth.

1301
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,271
There was noises.

1302
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,574
It was disgusting.

1303
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:52,209
Oh, okay.

1304
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:55,646
- So the next task
was the armpit smelling.

1305
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:59,650
And what the actual hell
was that?

1306
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:09,426
- There you go.

1307
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:10,561
I don't know.

1308
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,497
- No, no, don't... don't do that.

1309
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:14,965
Oh, come on.

1310
00:52:15,032 --> 00:52:16,967
- Rachel almost fainted.

1311
00:52:17,034 --> 00:52:19,336
That's none of my business
what he's got brewing

1312
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:21,472
in that armpit stew.

1313
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:23,140
- Okay.

1314
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:25,476
It's a little different,
but good...

1315
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,645
I feel like.

1316
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:31,348
- Definitely didn't expect to
be doing that ever in my life.

1317
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:32,883
You just got to embrace it.

1318
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:36,320
And I think everyone's
pretty much on the same page.

1319
00:52:36,387 --> 00:52:38,427
Just trying to make this day
as special as possible,

1320
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,057
make her feel
as special as possible.

1321
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:44,828
- Next one is you will write
a love letter to Rachel.

1322
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:48,632
Writing love notes is the most
romantic gesture you can do.

1323
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:52,436
- "At the end of all this,
I hope I'm your guy.

1324
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:56,273
I just love how we both grew up
watching planes fly."

1325
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,175
- "I want to be someone
you can count on,

1326
00:52:58,242 --> 00:52:59,877
"someone you can trust,

1327
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,713
and most importantly,
someone you can love."

1328
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,683
- You guys,
you make me feel so special.

1329
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,385
I came into today
feeling super low

1330
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:10,954
and having a really rough night.

1331
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,158
But these guys really did
turn it all around.

1332
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,593
- "Our adventure's coming.

1333
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,596
"There's no need to rush.

1334
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,632
From Logan with love."

1335
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:24,234
- It's really showing me
how much they care.

1336
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,603
I could tell that they
want to change

1337
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,006
and they want me to feel better.

1338
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:30,708
- Last night, I wrote something

1339
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:34,611
and I was hoping I would
get an opportunity today.

1340
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:37,981
"I'd wake up happy at
just the thought of her smile.

1341
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,917
"My plans for the day,
making sure

1342
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:42,553
"she always knew
I'd go that extra mile.

1343
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:47,958
"I finally felt like I had
a purpose in this world...

1344
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:50,694
and I'd do whatever I could
for this girl."

1345
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,699
"Though I may
get hurt once again,

1346
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:57,634
"it's worth every second
to feel again.

1347
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,970
Mi amour."

1348
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:01,271
- So sweet.

1349
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:05,175
Right now,
I feel noticed and supported

1350
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,611
and uplifted
by all of these guys.

1351
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:10,314
And I feel wanted.

1352
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,716
It just is such
an incredible feeling.

1353
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:16,386
Thank you all, I can tell
you guys seriously put

1354
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:17,521
so much effort into it

1355
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,989
and that's all I asked for
today.

1356
00:54:19,056 --> 00:54:21,492
So from the bottom of my heart,
thank you.

1357
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,961
I do have a dinner tonight,

1358
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:25,896
and there is going
to be a rose there,

1359
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:28,398
and the decision
is so difficult.

1360
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,367
I'm gonna take
a little bit of time

1361
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:34,104
to decide who I want
to take on the date tonight.

1362
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:35,105
- It would really mean the world

1363
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:36,306
if I got that one-on-one.

1364
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,575
There's a lot more I want to say

1365
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,378
and, you know, a lot more
I want to know about her.

1366
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,648
- I'm a bit torn at the moment.

1367
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:47,818
I've gotten to know Rachel
as this wonderful person,

1368
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:51,588
but I didn't feel a strong
spark and connection.

1369
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:55,492
And I walk away
from the group date

1370
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:56,794
thinking about Gabby.

1371
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,205
- Today was really crazy,

1372
00:55:08,272 --> 00:55:11,508
because I started off
really emotional,

1373
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:13,477
but the guys really did
step it up

1374
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:16,180
and I got to make
a tough decision tonight,

1375
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,215
which was
to bring someone over...

1376
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:24,054
And to have some one-on-one
time with them.

1377
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:26,423
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hello!

1378
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,791
- Hello, how are you?
- Welcome.

1379
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:29,660
- You look absolutely gorgeous.

1380
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:33,230
- I truly think having
Tyler over tonight

1381
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:35,132
is the best decision.

1382
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:37,634
He really stood out to me today.

1383
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:38,869
Oh!

1384
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:40,971
That was perfect.
- That was good, right?

1385
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:43,040
- I'm just really excited
to get to know him

1386
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:45,108
because I feel like
something could be there.

1387
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,410
I'm happy you're here.

1388
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:48,345
- I am more than happy I'm here.

1389
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:50,881
- I think today,
you were extremely vulnerable.

1390
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:53,851
Everything you did
truly touched me,

1391
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,285
especially down to the poem

1392
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,763
and the fact that you just
had it in your pocket!

1393
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:58,222
- I know, I know.

1394
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:00,991
I just... I just had a lot
of feelings from last night,

1395
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:02,669
and I wasn't sure
if I was gonna get a chance

1396
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:03,927
to read it today.

1397
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:06,430
But I was really glad
I got the opportunity.

1398
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:07,431
- Well, me too.

1399
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:08,899
Cheers to you.
- Cheers to you,

1400
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:10,043
are you kidding me?
- And to France.

1401
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:12,236
- And to France, absolutely.

1402
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,340
- But kind of like you said...

1403
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:17,941
- Mm-hmm?
- I am very curious

1404
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:19,376
to hear more.

1405
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:21,078
- With the poem.
- Mm-hmm.

1406
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,388
Yeah,
I wanted to know more about it.

1407
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:24,448
- Yeah, no, absolutely.

1408
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:26,917
In the beginning,
you know, kind of, like,

1409
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:29,419
talking about a past
relationship that I had.

1410
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:32,256
- Mm-hmm.
- It was deeper than,

1411
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:34,524
you know, anything I've
ever experienced before.

1412
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:37,995
I... I was ready to commit fully.

1413
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,429
I bought a house for us.

1414
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:40,697
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

1415
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:43,800
And out of nowhere,

1416
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:47,104
kind of, she just said
she couldn't do it.

1417
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,940
Said that, you know, she...

1418
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:51,341
She couldn't be with me anymore.

1419
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,886
That, you know, she was
going through her own stuff.

1420
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,244
- That must
have been really hard.

1421
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:55,412
- Yeah, it was tough.

1422
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:58,015
But the thing was
that I took from it,

1423
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,485
I knew the pain that I went
through and it hurts like hell.

1424
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,954
But the love,
that unconditional love

1425
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:06,089
that I was able to feel,

1426
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:08,458
was the best feeling
in the world.

1427
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:11,695
And I want to give that
to the right person, you know?

1428
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:12,963
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm not scared

1429
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,710
of getting hurt again
because, like I said,

1430
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:18,101
that feeling is ten times
better than the pain.

1431
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:20,370
- Yeah.
- And it's worth every second.

1432
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,206
- I feel like I see
so much of myself in you.

1433
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,608
- Yeah.
- Like, you seem like

1434
00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:28,912
you're just so willing
to just love and be hurt

1435
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:32,349
because love to you
is just the ultimate thing.

1436
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:34,885
- Yes.
- And that's exactly how I am.

1437
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,154
And I haven't met
many people like me.

1438
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,564
- Neither have I.
- Not even saying that, like,

1439
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:40,824
I'm special, but I just
feel like getting hurt

1440
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:43,460
is so worth it to feel love.
- Yeah, absolutely.

1441
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:44,962
It's the best feeling
in the world.

1442
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,229
- Mm-hmm.
- It's what I want

1443
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,296
at the end of the day.

1444
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:49,099
I want the unconditional love.

1445
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:50,443
- Me too.
- And, like, the hardest part

1446
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,202
was trying to find somebody

1447
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:53,637
who can love as hard as you can.

1448
00:57:53,704 --> 00:57:55,105
- Mm-hmm.
- And it seems like you

1449
00:57:55,172 --> 00:57:57,441
really, really love hard.
- Mm-hmm.

1450
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:59,776
- And that's when I was just,
like, oh, my gosh,

1451
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:02,112
I would do anything
to meet this girl, you know,

1452
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:04,114
to have a conversation
with her, at least.

1453
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:05,916
Like, I came here for you.

1454
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,093
And you know that.

1455
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:09,286
So prime example, like,

1456
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:11,788
when I knew how passionate
you were about

1457
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:13,156
being, like, a pilot.
- Mm-hmm.

1458
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,058
- And if I had to take care
of the house,

1459
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:17,060
I'd be doing the cooking
and the cleaning,

1460
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:19,529
whatever I had to do
just for my wifey.

1461
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:20,530
- So you're okay with that?

1462
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:21,798
- Absolutely, yeah.
- Okay.

1463
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:23,333
- 100% okay with that.
- Yeah.

1464
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,668
Mm-hmm.
- So...

1465
00:58:24,735 --> 00:58:26,045
- You're saying
all the right things.

1466
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,213
- That's what I want in life.

1467
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:31,675
I want to be somebody's rock,
you know?

1468
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:33,410
- I love that.
- Yeah.

1469
00:58:33,477 --> 00:58:36,146
- And I want you to know
that when you walk into a room,

1470
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:38,315
you're the only person I see.

1471
00:58:38,382 --> 00:58:40,650
So, yeah.

1472
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,927
- I am so excited about Tyler.

1473
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:54,231
He is so unafraid of love.

1474
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:58,635
He truly did make me realize
that this was working for me.

1475
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:01,038
I think that fear
is definitely behind me.

1476
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,240
It's such a good feeling.

1477
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,780
- So what's on your mind?

1478
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:14,184
- Every time I'm in the same
room as Gabby and Rachel,

1479
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:16,920
I realize
my feelings toward Gabby.

1480
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:18,522
At the first group date,

1481
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,223
we had a great connection.

1482
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:23,293
It was like fireworks at first.

1483
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,729
- Mm-hmm.
- But after that night,

1484
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:28,665
I never got to talk
to Gabby again.

1485
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,435
But then Rachel gave me a rose.

1486
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:35,338
- These roses are extremely,
extremely important to me.

1487
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:39,142
It truly means that I do
see a connection.

1488
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:40,777
Tyler...
- Yes?

1489
00:59:40,844 --> 00:59:42,145
- Will you accept this rose?

1490
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:45,082
- Absolutely,
I will accept that rose.

1491
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:46,459
- You accepted
the rose from Rachel

1492
00:59:46,483 --> 00:59:48,485
at the last Rose Ceremony,
knowing that you were

1493
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:50,821
then expected to date her
and only her.

1494
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:53,256
- I've loved
getting to know her,

1495
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:57,360
but I... I don't see
how I can move forward

1496
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,196
without bringing it up
in some way.

1497
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,164
- What do you think
she's gonna say?

1498
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:03,166
She had a lot of guys
reject her rose.

1499
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:06,736
- I'm terrified to think
that I could be someone who

1500
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:10,841
could add to the laundry list
of disappointments.

1501
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,310
I'm more excited,

1502
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:14,678
are you kidding me?

1503
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:15,922
All right,
so I'll make a cheers.

1504
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,047
- Okay.
- All right?

1505
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,191
- I mean,
do you think it's real?

1506
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:19,349
I mean, do you see a future

1507
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:21,284
with you and Gabby?

1508
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:25,055
- I need to know first if she
felt what I felt that night.

1509
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,266
There was a lot of unanswered
questions and feelings there.

1510
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,725
- Yeah.

1511
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:29,926
- I need to talk to Gabby.

1512
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:42,139
- Hi!

1513
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:48,345
- I missed you.

1514
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,481
It's been kind of a tough week,

1515
01:00:51,548 --> 01:00:53,917
but also one of
the best weeks I've had

1516
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:55,619
where these guys
were really able

1517
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:57,754
to let me know
they're here for me.

1518
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,723
Ad I feel really, really good.

1519
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,758
I'm so excited for tonight.

1520
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,260
- Coming into tonight
with no rose

1521
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,729
gives me encouragement to kind
of get that one-on-one time

1522
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:08,732
and see if we can build
this connection.

1523
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:11,434
- For me,
this one is all about honesty.

1524
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,170
It's time for me to come forward

1525
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:14,604
with some honest truths.

1526
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,907
So looking forward to that part.

1527
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,742
Tonight at the Cocktail Party,

1528
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:21,311
I'm going to have
a conversation with Gabby

1529
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:23,079
and express my feelings for her.

1530
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:30,520
I want to know if Gabby feels
the same thing I feel.

1531
01:01:30,587 --> 01:01:34,424
No matter how wonderful
Rachel truly is,

1532
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:36,560
the heart wants what it wants.

1533
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:37,561
- Here you go, ladies.

1534
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:38,895
Thank you.

1535
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:39,896
- Hi, guys.

1536
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:42,432
I'm really happy to be here

1537
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:45,502
with you all today in France,
finally all together.

1538
01:01:45,569 --> 01:01:48,638
And a lot of you really
stepped up this week.

1539
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,707
I had a little bit
of a rocky start,

1540
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:53,076
but I appreciate
all of you guys.

1541
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:56,446
As hard as it has been
to be away from Gabby,

1542
01:01:56,513 --> 01:01:59,516
I feel as if we finally
are on our own journeys.

1543
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:01,551
- It's been crazy
without Rachel.

1544
01:02:01,618 --> 01:02:03,386
I think we miss each other
every day,

1545
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:05,622
but I think we're finding
our footing.

1546
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:08,758
I feel like connections
have been flourishing

1547
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,794
at, like, rapid speed.

1548
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,462
It's honestly been insane,

1549
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:15,665
but I'm incredibly grateful
for all of you guys here.

1550
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,368
So cheers
to a great end to the week.

1551
01:02:18,435 --> 01:02:19,936
Cheers.

1552
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:23,740
- Well, shall we?

1553
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:26,176
At the group date this week,
Nate really had

1554
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,678
a sweet sentiment
before his match with Erich.

1555
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,065
How are you?
- Oh, I'm doing good.

1556
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:33,416
He's so mature
in so many ways and just

1557
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,585
isn't afraid to make me
feel special.

1558
01:02:35,652 --> 01:02:37,988
Knowing that he notices
the little things

1559
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:39,856
makes me feel so, so good.

1560
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,324
- So how...
- I know.

1561
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:43,460
- How have things been for you?

1562
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:44,637
- They've been good.
- Really?

1563
01:02:44,661 --> 01:02:46,229
- Yeah, this... this week

1564
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:48,098
was actually pretty good.

1565
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:49,099
- Okay.
- And I wanted to say

1566
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:50,333
thank you so much.

1567
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,510
What you said in the boxing ring

1568
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:52,636
was so sweet.
- Really?

1569
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:54,604
- Yeah, like, I always feel like

1570
01:02:54,671 --> 01:02:56,773
I'm being seen by you,
which is so nice.

1571
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,774
- I appreciate that.

1572
01:02:57,841 --> 01:02:59,309
I was so nervous going in.

1573
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:01,711
Like, I'm not really, like,
the most eloquent with words,

1574
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,147
but I do care about you
and you are important to me.

1575
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:06,383
- It was so nice.
- Yeah.

1576
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:14,767
- So I wanted to share something

1577
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,760
that's very important to me...

1578
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:17,927
- Yeah.
- With you.

1579
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:20,664
So this is Rambo.

1580
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:22,465
And, um...
- Oh, my goodness.

1581
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,167
Oh, my gosh.

1582
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:26,336
- I want to show you
a few pictures of him.

1583
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:29,472
Oh, my gosh!

1584
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,008
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, look at that one.

1585
01:03:32,075 --> 01:03:34,778
- The other day
when we had the group date,

1586
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:36,746
I didn't get any one-on-one
time with Rachel,

1587
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,648
and I didn't
get the group date rose.

1588
01:03:38,715 --> 01:03:40,417
It makes me
a little bit nervous,

1589
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,218
especially going
into a Rose Ceremony.

1590
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:44,387
- You look so happy there.

1591
01:03:44,454 --> 01:03:47,090
- I'm telling you,
he's... he is one of the most

1592
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,892
important things in my life.

1593
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,560
- Yeah.
- My main goal now

1594
01:03:50,627 --> 01:03:52,829
is to get
that rose tonight from Rachel.

1595
01:03:52,896 --> 01:03:55,365
And I have something
to share with her,

1596
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:57,300
something that will take
our relationship

1597
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:58,568
to another level.

1598
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:00,337
So this is kind of where, like,

1599
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:01,971
it starts hitting

1600
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:03,506
a little bit differently now.
- Yeah.

1601
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,075
- About eight months ago...
- Yeah.

1602
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:09,846
- He, um, got diagnosed

1603
01:04:09,913 --> 01:04:11,681
with a brain tumor.
- Mm.

1604
01:04:11,748 --> 01:04:16,319
- And, you know,
it happened within 48 hours.

1605
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:18,855
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, it was just...

1606
01:04:18,922 --> 01:04:20,824
I mean,
his entire head caved in.

1607
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,460
- Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry.
- And, you know,

1608
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:24,886
the doctor kind of
said... he goes,

1609
01:04:24,928 --> 01:04:26,930
"Hayden,
if you do the radiation...

1610
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:29,332
"if you don't do it, he can
have four to six months left.

1611
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:31,768
And if you do it, you know,
he could have a year."

1612
01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:34,871
- Oh, my... so, he only... so
you think he only has a year?

1613
01:04:34,938 --> 01:04:37,207
- He... at this point, probably
only has a couple months.

1614
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:38,441
- Oh, my gosh.

1615
01:04:38,508 --> 01:04:40,477
I'm so sorry.
- And... and I'm obviously

1616
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,188
telling you this because
I want you to understand

1617
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:44,614
that, you know,
I wouldn't be here

1618
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:46,416
if my intentions weren't to try

1619
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:49,119
to obviously further
our relationship, right?

1620
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:52,922
- I definitely can tell
how much he means to you.

1621
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:55,291
And I do appreciate the fact

1622
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:56,693
that you're sharing this
with me.

1623
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:00,430
I know how much
it probably takes

1624
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:02,332
for you to be away from him.

1625
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:05,068
I definitely feel for Hayden.

1626
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:09,239
It's genuinely sad
how much he does love his dog

1627
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:11,241
and how hard it is
for him to be away.

1628
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:14,344
- This is his cancer duck
that went through,

1629
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,055
obviously, all the radiation
appointments with him.

1630
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,914
- Oh, my gosh.
- Obviously, I can't

1631
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:20,650
carry that around,
but what I do carry around

1632
01:05:20,717 --> 01:05:23,219
is one of his duck paws.

1633
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:25,522
- Oh, my goodness,
that's so sweet.

1634
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,158
- Well.
- Oh, my gosh.

1635
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,660
- Yes, so...

1636
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:32,929
- I can't imagine how much
this means to you.

1637
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:34,106
- When you all have a moment,

1638
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,732
I would love some time
with Rachel.

1639
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:37,376
- Yeah, of course.
- Are you doing all right?

1640
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,401
- Yeah, yeah.

1641
01:05:38,468 --> 01:05:39,645
- Thank you so much...
- Appreciate it.

1642
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:40,713
- For sharing this with me.
- Of course.

1643
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:41,847
- I appreciate it.
- Thanks, Rachel.

1644
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:44,841
- So good talking to you.

1645
01:05:44,908 --> 01:05:48,244
- It's very tough to see
Rachel's response to that.

1646
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:49,879
What I would have expected

1647
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,449
from Rachel is to, you know,
give me a minute,

1648
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:54,417
let me finish this conversation.

1649
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:57,020
Not get up
quicker than she sat down.

1650
01:05:57,086 --> 01:06:00,290
It's very difficult
for me to feel okay

1651
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:02,125
walking out of that conversation

1652
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:06,262
and feel comfortable saying
that's the person for me.

1653
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,164
- Hearing this from Hayden,

1654
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:09,999
you know, Hayden's got
a history of saying,

1655
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,168
you know, mean,
hurtful things behind her back.

1656
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:14,204
It's just unacceptable.

1657
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,239
- My dumb ass uses
the same verbiage

1658
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:18,174
that Gabby uses
to describe herself,

1659
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:20,210
and she didn't like that.

1660
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:21,520
Well, bitch,
maybe you shouldn't use

1661
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,222
that word
to describe yourself, then.

1662
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,082
- Oh, my God.

1663
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,450
- I've been comparing, right?

1664
01:06:27,517 --> 01:06:28,852
I've been comparing my ex

1665
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:32,121
to, like... like, this,
right?

1666
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,491
They don't hold a candle to her.

1667
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:36,392
Man, and I don't want
to just settle.

1668
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:38,294
- Rachel gave me
a second chance.

1669
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,597
You know,
she's very honest with me,

1670
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:43,666
and, you know, I want to be
as honest with her as possible.

1671
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:45,602
Do you want to sit down?
- Yeah.

1672
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,304
You know, Rachel needs...

1673
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:49,472
Needs to know that.

1674
01:06:49,539 --> 01:06:50,573
How you doing?

1675
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,684
- I'm great.
- How's your night been?

1676
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:52,708
- No, it's so good.

1677
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:53,676
I'm so happy to see you
because...

1678
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:54,820
- I'm so happy to see you too.

1679
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,379
- You finally are
out of the doghouse.

1680
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:58,047
- Thank you.

1681
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,148
- But...

1682
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:00,717
- On a serious note...
- Okay.

1683
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:02,027
- There is something
I need to tell you.

1684
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:03,253
- Mm-hmm.

1685
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:04,654
- I do really like you a lot.

1686
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:06,022
You know, I respect you.

1687
01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:07,132
You're very honest with me,

1688
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:09,492
and I want to be
very honest to you.

1689
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:13,363
There was a conversation
that I had with Hayden...

1690
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:16,366
at the mansion,
and it was pretty unpleasant.

1691
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:18,167
It was after the Rose Ceremony.
- Hayden?

1692
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:20,336
- Yeah.
- After... in LA?

1693
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,405
- In LA.
- Okay.

1694
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:26,809
- He said that you and Gabby

1695
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,112
were both overreacting
to what he said.

1696
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:33,016
- Hmm.
- And then

1697
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:37,921
he made a vulgar comparison
about you and his ex.

1698
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:41,457
It was something about breasts.

1699
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:46,462
And he also said that,
"I don't trust these bitches."

1700
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:50,266
Referring to you and Gabby.

1701
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:55,939
- I really appreciate you

1702
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:58,374
bringing this information to me.

1703
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:01,144
And, yeah,
it's definitely upsetting,

1704
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,713
but I think I'm gonna have
a conversation with him,

1705
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,014
if you don't mind.

1706
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,182
- Mm-hmm.
- Is that okay?

1707
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:07,726
- Yes, absolutely.
- Well, thank you again,

1708
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,218
seriously,
for bringing this to me.

1709
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:11,921
- Yeah.
- I really do trust James.

1710
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:13,723
I don't think
he would be a liar.

1711
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:15,258
I trust his character.

1712
01:08:16,993 --> 01:08:19,862
It's just, like,
so disrespectful.

1713
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:23,700
Especially the morning after
I give you a second chance

1714
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,703
and then call me a bitch.

1715
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:30,974
- It just hurt because of how
much I sacrificed to be here.

1716
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,575
- Yeah.
- He's got a brain tumor.

1717
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:33,876
He could die at any moment.

1718
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:39,649
- Why does she look pissed off?

1719
01:08:39,716 --> 01:08:41,484
- I don't know.

1720
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:44,053
- And, you know, to have it

1721
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:48,124
not completely
received that way, I...

1722
01:08:48,191 --> 01:08:49,792
- Hayden.

1723
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,518
- Do you know why I'm
talking to you right now?

1724
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:08,778
- No, Rachel, I don't.
- You don't know.

1725
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:11,848
- I'm assuming it's about Rambo.

1726
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,983
- About the dog?

1727
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:17,787
- I think so.

1728
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:19,355
That's what I would have said.

1729
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,259
- Hayden, do you...

1730
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,603
Okay.
- I've spoken to a few people

1731
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:25,995
about how our conversation went.

1732
01:09:26,062 --> 01:09:29,032
- Mm-hmm.
- And, um...

1733
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:31,267
you know, to be frank,
I think our conversation

1734
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:34,237
got interrupted with Tino.

1735
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:37,040
- That's what you think
is happening?

1736
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:39,909
- I think so.
- Okay.

1737
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:43,880
I really... I appreciate you
sharing it with me,

1738
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:46,449
but I had some more information
brought to me tonight.

1739
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,384
And I'm actually
really upset about it

1740
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:51,954
because I feel after what
was said about Gabby in LA,

1741
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:54,724
I was willing to kind of
move forward this week.

1742
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:58,428
And the next day
you went and said,

1743
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:00,496
"I can't trust these bitches"?

1744
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,765
- That's not what I said.
- I just don't believe you.

1745
01:10:02,832 --> 01:10:04,634
- Well, that's fine,
but it's not what I said.

1746
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:05,601
- Okay.

1747
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:06,602
Did you make comments

1748
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:08,271
comparing me to your ex?

1749
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:10,173
My boobs to your ex?

1750
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:11,407
- No.

1751
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:12,909
- You didn't.
- No, no.

1752
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,478
I did not say anything...
I did not compare anyone

1753
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:16,646
to you.
- Okay.

1754
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,815
This isn't conversations
between us.

1755
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,250
- Okay, I'm not talking
about the guys either.

1756
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:24,353
- I'm just, like,
I'm having... oh, my God.

1757
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,589
Oh, Hayden, this is just
hard for me because

1758
01:10:26,656 --> 01:10:30,026
I feel like it's something...
One thing after another.

1759
01:10:30,093 --> 01:10:31,761
- It is very upsetting
that anyone

1760
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:33,496
would even come or say that.

1761
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,164
I don't speak like that.
- Okay.

1762
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,299
- That's not my character.

1763
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:37,685
- The person
who brought it to me,

1764
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:40,536
I really just don't feel like
would make this much up.

1765
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:45,108
I really feel like I gave you
the chance in LA.

1766
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:46,209
- Yeah.
- I'm giving you

1767
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:49,278
the chance now to own up to it.

1768
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:52,749
- And Rachel, explicitly,
I'm telling you right now,

1769
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:53,992
that's not what I said.
- Okay.

1770
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:55,618
I just really feel like

1771
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:57,286
this is kind of
the end of my rope.

1772
01:10:57,353 --> 01:11:00,523
I'm hitting roadblock after
roadblock after roadblock,

1773
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,024
and I can't keep doing it.

1774
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,469
I can't really
keep dealing with it.

1775
01:11:03,493 --> 01:11:04,927
Can I walk you out?

1776
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:06,662
- Yes.
- Okay.

1777
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:13,536
I feel really stupid
for giving Hayden

1778
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,104
the benefit of the doubt.

1779
01:11:15,171 --> 01:11:20,476
He just lies, and I feel
very taken advantage of

1780
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:24,147
because this last Rose
Ceremony was really difficult.

1781
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:26,516
Only the next day,
call me a bitch

1782
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:30,787
and say you couldn't trust me
after I was trusting him

1783
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:32,955
to bring him into a second week.

1784
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:35,625
At this point,
I'm just extremely ready

1785
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:38,561
for Hayden to get
the out, to be frank.

1786
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:42,298
- Rachel,
I respect you as a woman,

1787
01:11:42,365 --> 01:11:44,801
and I just... I heard you.

1788
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:46,669
- Thanks.
- Okay, so...

1789
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:48,037
- Thanks, Hayden.

1790
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:02,451
- She walked him out,
like, it's that simple.

1791
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:03,920
I don't want
to see her upset again.

1792
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,497
Like, she was upset
two nights ago with us

1793
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:06,522
for some other stuff.

1794
01:12:06,589 --> 01:12:08,491
- He said that...

1795
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:10,893
"I don't trust these bitches,"
and...

1796
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,565
- Hayden didn't say anything
too kind to Rachel.

1797
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:17,366
I don't ever want
to see Rachel hurt,

1798
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:19,502
so... pisses me off.

1799
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:27,977
- I really wanted this to work,
but...

1800
01:12:31,314 --> 01:12:33,015
I want Rambo more.

1801
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:37,854
I know right now for a fact that

1802
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,924
no one has the amount of love
that I have for Rambo

1803
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:43,559
and that Rambo has for me.

1804
01:12:45,428 --> 01:12:47,096
I am blessed that I have Rambo,

1805
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:48,965
who loves me unconditionally.

1806
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,300
Rachel, I hope you find
someone that is going

1807
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,836
to treat you the way
that Rambo treats me.

1808
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:54,903
I'm ready.

1809
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:58,007
I'm ready to see Rambo.

1810
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:07,650
- I'm just, like, over this.

1811
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:10,286
I'm tired of having to, like,
deal with this

1812
01:13:10,353 --> 01:13:12,288
every single time.

1813
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:13,732
It's, like,
I'm tired of having to do this

1814
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,259
over and over
and over and over again.

1815
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:19,328
Can we have one day
where someone doesn't act

1816
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,330
like a?

1817
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:26,402
I feel like I keep having
great days and then

1818
01:13:26,469 --> 01:13:27,637
something will happen.

1819
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:30,539
And I just feel
really exhausted.

1820
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,475
It's just so hard because I know

1821
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,076
that this is working for Gabby.

1822
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:35,354
I think she has
some amazing guys

1823
01:13:35,378 --> 01:13:38,381
who really, really
care about her.

1824
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:40,983
- All I could think about
was you the last three days.

1825
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,418
- Mm-hmm.

1826
01:13:42,485 --> 01:13:43,519
Mm.

1827
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:53,663
No matter who it is,
even if it's someone

1828
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:56,365
you're not, like, this is my
husband, it's rejection.

1829
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,943
You just want to sit there
and be like,

1830
01:13:57,967 --> 01:13:59,402
well, this isn't working for me.

1831
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:01,904
I'm a failure.

1832
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:06,008
It's hard to every
single day be like,

1833
01:14:06,075 --> 01:14:09,612
I feel so good,
then I feel so bad.

1834
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:14,583
It's like every single day
is, like, a roller coaster.

1835
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:18,788
I'm having too many
of these moments.

1836
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:20,990
Just, I'm done.

1837
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,732
- This night took quite a turn.

1838
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,634
I'm at a loss for words.

1839
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:35,237
- Gentlemen.

1840
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,006
Tonight, Rachel was given
some information

1841
01:14:37,073 --> 01:14:38,741
about some things
that Hayden said

1842
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:41,911
that was really disturbing.

1843
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,946
She was really hurt.

1844
01:14:44,013 --> 01:14:46,248
We're gonna cancel
the rest of the cocktail party.

1845
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:50,820
See you at the Rose Ceremony.

1846
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:52,388
Good luck, gentlemen.

1847
01:14:55,091 --> 01:14:58,160
- There's a lot of people
that didn't get time.

1848
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,729
- I didn't.

1849
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:01,163
- You didn't get time?

1850
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,698
- No.

1851
01:15:02,765 --> 01:15:04,867
Yeah, I definitely
had a couple of things to say.

1852
01:15:04,934 --> 01:15:06,869
I'm pretty frustrated.

1853
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:08,237
I want to tell the truth.

1854
01:15:08,304 --> 01:15:12,541
I want to be honest
about my feelings with Gabby.

1855
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:16,612
There's no way I can
move forward with Rachel.

1856
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:19,982
I don't know exactly
what I'm gonna do.

1857
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:22,651
Should I keep accepting roses?

1858
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:26,689
Pretending like everything's
cool when it's not?

1859
01:15:26,756 --> 01:15:29,091
- Tonight, I made a decision

1860
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:32,128
that Hayden just
isn't here for me.

1861
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,030
He's not the man for me.

1862
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:38,601
But thank you so much to those
who continue to trust me.

1863
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:41,270
And I'm really excited
about my connections here.

1864
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:43,472
So thank you, guys.

1865
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,508
- Yeah, and same.

1866
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:47,410
Thank you guys as always.

1867
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:50,112
Honestly,
it was such a good week.

1868
01:15:50,179 --> 01:15:53,416
I really am deepening
so many connections,

1869
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:55,418
so I just want
to thank you guys, too,

1870
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:58,487
for trusting me on this journey.

1871
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,732
Nate.

1872
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,139
Nate, will you accept this rose?

1873
01:16:17,206 --> 01:16:18,774
- Yes.

1874
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:31,420
- Hey, what's up, guys?

1875
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:33,689
- Big dog.
- Here it is.

1876
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:34,756
Come here, man.

1877
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:35,925
What's the scene out there?

1878
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:37,626
- Two people are going home.

1879
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:38,961
- Really?
- On both sides, yeah.

1880
01:16:39,028 --> 01:16:41,330
Hayden's already gone
for Rachel's side.

1881
01:16:41,397 --> 01:16:43,365
It's gonna be a trial.

1882
01:16:48,304 --> 01:16:49,772
- Aven.

1883
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:55,478
Aven, will you accept this rose?

1884
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:57,046
- Of course I will.

1885
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:05,154
- Aven!

1886
01:17:06,755 --> 01:17:08,757
What's up, fellas?
- I believed in you.

1887
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:10,735
- What's going on, man?
- Tyler didn't believe in you.

1888
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:12,728
I did.

1889
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,830
- Erich.

1890
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,239
Erich,
will you accept this rose?

1891
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,875
- Yes, of course.

1892
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:28,711
- I'm here for Rachel,
and I think what we have

1893
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:30,513
is something pretty special.

1894
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:33,115
Honestly, like,
when I'm with her,

1895
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:37,119
time stops and, um...

1896
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,523
I have incredibly strong
feelings for her.

1897
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:42,525
So getting a rose tonight
would mean the world.

1898
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:44,426
- So you're thinking Zach next?

1899
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,529
Who are you thinking?

1900
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:47,939
- Yeah.
- I'm... I'm thinking that too.

1901
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:49,763
- Yeah, for sure Zach.
- Yeah, Zach, for sure.

1902
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:54,136
- No way.

1903
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:55,704
- What's up, dude?
- What's going on?

1904
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:57,940
- Good to see you.

1905
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:04,313
- Johnny.

1906
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,652
Will you accept this rose?
- You know I will.

1907
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:11,053
- God, the anticipation.

1908
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,855
It's nerve-racking.

1909
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:14,499
- It hasn't been
an easy week for Rachel,

1910
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:17,059
so I have no clue
how she'll react

1911
01:18:17,126 --> 01:18:19,862
about my feelings for Gabby.

1912
01:18:19,929 --> 01:18:23,032
This could be an argument,
this could be a disaster.

1913
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:26,202
It's gonna be devastating.

1914
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:29,772
The longer I wait,
the more damage will be done.

1915
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:33,976
- Zach.

1916
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:38,714
Zach, will you accept this rose?

1917
01:18:38,781 --> 01:18:39,982
- Absolutely.

1918
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:42,518
Thank you very much.

1919
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:51,594
- Michael.

1920
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,467
Michael,
will you accept this rose?

1921
01:18:58,534 --> 01:18:59,702
- Yes, I will.

1922
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:01,437
- Who would shock you guys
the most

1923
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,072
if they didn't get a rose?

1924
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:04,138
- Logan.
- Logan.

1925
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:05,107
- I think Logan too.
- Yeah.

1926
01:19:05,174 --> 01:19:06,308
- It's just interesting that

1927
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:07,776
he didn't get time tonight.

1928
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:10,012
I don't know if he's
trying hard enough.

1929
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,556
I feel like we're gonna be
shocked on this one.

1930
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,048
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be Logan,

1931
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:16,819
for sure.
- Sheesh.

1932
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:18,520
- Wow.

1933
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:26,462
- Gabby, Rachel, gentlemen.

1934
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:29,632
It's the final rose tonight.
When you both are ready.

1935
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:37,706
- So we got one more rose.
- One more rose.

1936
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:41,343
- Just curious to see who
comes through that door next.

1937
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:43,312
- Why they gotta make it
so stressful?

1938
01:19:52,021 --> 01:19:54,623
- Mario.

1939
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,796
Mario,
will you accept this rose?

1940
01:20:00,863 --> 01:20:02,364
- I will.

1941
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:07,036
- No one yet.

1942
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:09,650
- So it's... now
it's Logan or Jordan.

1943
01:20:09,705 --> 01:20:12,541
- I don't know
who doesn't get it.

1944
01:20:12,608 --> 01:20:13,876
- I'm nervous.

1945
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:16,612
Do I keep accepting roses?

1946
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:19,815
I'm on really
dangerous waters here.

1947
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,219
Do I say yes?

1948
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:26,755
I'm just at a loss
at this point.

1949
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:37,131
- Logan.

1950
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:47,810
Will you accept this rose?

1951
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:54,283
- Yes.

1952
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:14,636
She gave me a rose,
and I feel like the bad guy.

1953
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:17,306
- Oh, my God.

1954
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:19,241
- And the last one.

1955
01:21:19,308 --> 01:21:22,544
- I feel selfish,
but I would be a fool

1956
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:24,480
not to accept a rose...

1957
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:25,848
- Hey!
- Hey!

1958
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:28,384
- If it means I get
to talk with Gabby.

1959
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:31,220
There's still hope,
there's still time.

1960
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:32,888
I'm gonna get it all out there.

1961
01:21:32,955 --> 01:21:35,791
- I think that everybody here
has very good intentions.

1962
01:21:35,858 --> 01:21:37,593
There's no doubt about that.

1963
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:39,995
- We've got to also
try to avoid, like,

1964
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:42,264
upsetting her for one week,
you know?

1965
01:21:42,331 --> 01:21:43,532
- Yeah, like...

1966
01:21:43,599 --> 01:21:45,443
- Let's have a good week.
- Let's have a good week.

1967
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:48,670
- Everyone on Rachel's side
is worried.

1968
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,539
It hasn't been
an easy week for her.

1969
01:21:50,606 --> 01:21:52,708
And now I have the daunting task

1970
01:21:52,775 --> 01:21:56,278
of telling Rachel that
I've wanted to pursue Gabby.

1971
01:21:56,345 --> 01:21:57,679
- To Bruges, Belgium.

1972
01:22:01,784 --> 01:22:03,118
- The air is thick.

1973
01:22:03,185 --> 01:22:04,853
People are tense.

1974
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,089
I'm just terrified.

1975
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:09,358
- There's our girl.
- Hey, guys!

1976
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:12,995
I think a celebration
is in order.

1977
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:15,664
- There's a chance
that this isn't

1978
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:17,399
received at all well.

1979
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:19,067
This could be a disaster.

1980
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:22,538
Could totally
blow up in my face.

1981
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:25,941
Like, blaze of glory.

1982
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:28,610
But you know what?

1983
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:31,447
Fortune favors the bold.

1984
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:37,686
- Next week
on "The Bachelorette"...

1985
01:22:37,753 --> 01:22:39,788
Cheers to Bruges.

1986
01:22:39,855 --> 01:22:43,625
I feel like I'm riding a high
being here in Bruges, Belgium.

1987
01:22:43,692 --> 01:22:44,960
Do you like it?

1988
01:22:45,027 --> 01:22:48,096
I am just so excited
to see where things go.

1989
01:22:50,232 --> 01:22:51,834
- Every moment
I spend with Rachel,

1990
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,168
the connection is just there.

1991
01:22:53,235 --> 01:22:55,370
- I love that feeling
of seeing you smile.

1992
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:57,315
- At the end of the day,
when we look at each other,

1993
01:22:57,339 --> 01:22:59,208
we just know that we want
to be together.

1994
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:00,609
- You make all of this so easy.

1995
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:03,745
- I feel so happy.

1996
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,449
- I care about Rachel,
but I can't

1997
01:23:07,516 --> 01:23:09,751
put my initial feelings
for Gabby aside.

1998
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:12,120
This is humiliating.

1999
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:13,789
- Yeah.
- Humiliating.

2000
01:23:13,856 --> 01:23:15,757
Oh!

2001
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:16,859
- What is going on?

2002
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:18,026
- Is Logan coming in?

2003
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:19,304
- That's just a huge wild card.

2004
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,395
- Is Gabby questioning her

2005
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:21,473
connections with the rest of us?

2006
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:22,574
- That's like what's kind of

2007
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:23,866
going through my head.
- Yeah.

2008
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:25,634
- You know,
actions carry consequences,

2009
01:23:25,701 --> 01:23:27,636
and this really affected Rachel.

2010
01:23:27,703 --> 01:23:29,605
- It's gonna cause a stir.

2011
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:31,306
I quit.

2012
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:34,142
I don't want to do this anymore.

2013
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,681
- Okay, now, this one.

2014
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:42,351
Champagne, over the top.

2015
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:44,019
- Down.
- Because it will be

2016
01:23:44,086 --> 01:23:45,087
your champagne.

2017
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:46,655
- Oh!

2018
01:23:46,722 --> 01:23:47,932
- What?
- We're gonna stomp grapes.

2019
01:23:47,956 --> 01:23:49,157
- Yes.

2020
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:50,592
Oh, stop.

2021
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,195
- Oh, no!

2022
01:23:53,262 --> 01:23:54,997
- Oh, God.
- It feels so good.

2023
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:56,665
- Is this how
you make champagne?

2024
01:23:56,732 --> 01:23:58,967
Because I don't want this
kind with dirty feet.

2025
01:23:59,001 --> 01:24:00,001
- You're drinking it.

2026
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,839
- Jason, try harder.

2027
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,144
- Honestly, dream come true.

2028
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,445
- This is.

2029
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:16,852
- How do we call this champagne?

2030
01:24:16,919 --> 01:24:17,853
- Feet.

2031
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,855
Feet.

2032
01:24:19,922 --> 01:24:21,065
- My glass is...
- Do we drink it?

2033
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:22,024
- Yeah.

2034
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:23,425
- Oh!

2035
01:24:23,492 --> 01:24:24,960
You just drank foot wine.

2036
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:30,933
- Mmm, that's good.

2037
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:33,402
That tastes like your feet.

2038
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:36,405
Sweet.
- Mm-hmm.

2039
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:38,506
