1
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,508
<i>- I still can't believe
that I'm the Bachelorette,</i>

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,842
<i>Rachel's the Bachelorette,</i>

3
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,044
<i>we get this
amazing experience together</i>

4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:13,046
<i>to truly find love.</i>

5
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,186
<i>- There's really no rule book
for this,</i>

6
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:20,888
<i>so we're just going with it.</i>

7
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,690
<i>But I have absolutely no doubt</i>

8
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,260
<i>our future husbands are here.</i>

9
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,463
If you could kiss one of us,
which one would it be?

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,564
- Both?
- Absolutely.

11
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:31,665
- Good answer.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,768
<i>- I'm having so much fun</i>

13
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,203
<i>getting to know the guys.</i>

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,538
- So what do you think?

15
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,939
Yeah, he's a piece of.

16
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,476
- Oh!

17
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:43,577
<i>Love is in the air,</i>

18
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,345
<i>and I'm so excited</i>

19
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,748
<i>to see where things go
from here.</i>

20
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,249
- I'm so crazy about you,

21
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,652
and I don't want a future
without you.

22
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,121
<i>- I'm so happy right now.</i>

23
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,189
- What's up, Gabby?
What's up, Rachel?

24
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,425
What's up, Gabby?
What's up, Rachel?

25
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,428
- Meatball, will you accept
this rose?

26
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,430
- I'm sorry. I cannot.

27
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,566
I'm here for Gabby.

28
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,568
<i>Meatball rejected my rose.</i>

29
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,137
Like, this is the most
embarrassing thing in my life.

30
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,639
<i>- No one's really ready
to pick a lane and stay in it.</i>

31
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:16,710
<i>- Having two Bachelorettes
has provided struggle,</i>

32
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,946
<i>and I think it's all coming
to a head.</i>

33
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:22,716
- I do have my intentions
solely for Rachel.

34
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,786
- It's just, like, validating
all my fears.

35
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,788
- Things have obviously taken
a turn.

36
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,056
What do you wanna do?

37
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,991
- I need to tell her
this full truth.

38
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,795
<i>You change your mind?</i>

39
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,930
<i>Why am I even doing this?</i>

40
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:39,800
<i>Life is so hard.</i>

41
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,202
<i>I'm so done.</i>

42
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,471
<i>It's just so crazy</i>

43
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,239
<i>that this is, like,
the way it ends.</i>

44
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,947
<i>- It's the most shocking season</i>

45
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,582
<i>of "The Bachelorette" yet,</i>

46
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,051
<i>and it starts right now.</i>

47
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,658
Hi, I'm Jesse Palmer,

48
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,427
and welcome to this
extraordinary season

49
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,029
of "The Bachelorette."

50
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,298
What makes it so extraordinary?

51
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,266
Well, for the first time
in Bachelor history,

52
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,901
we're gonna have not one,

53
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,737
but two Bachelorettes,

54
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,071
both looking for love

55
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,274
and both hoping
for a romantic proposal.

56
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,511
And let me just tell you,
it's going to be a wild ride

57
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,046
all the way to the end.

58
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,914
Rachel Recchia
is a flight instructor

59
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,851
who's not afraid to put
her heart on the line.

60
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:34,321
Gabby Windey is an ICU nurse
with a sense of humor

61
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:36,456
that's had
all of America laughing.

62
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,659
And personally, I am so thrilled

63
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,460
that these two amazing women

64
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,829
will get a second chance
to find love

65
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,632
right here on this show.

66
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:49,102
So two women dating
one group of men.

67
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,637
How's that gonna work?

68
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,939
Which woman gets to date
which guy?

69
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,307
Who chooses?

70
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,109
And then what happens
if both women

71
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,345
fall in love with the same man?

72
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,881
Honestly, I'm not really sure.

73
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:04,184
But I am confident that Gabby
and Rachel can figure it out.

74
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,396
The most important thing
is that the women come in here

75
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,521
with a plan of their own,

76
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,089
and then they support each other

77
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,324
on this unusual quest
to find love.

78
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,760
Rachel and Gabby are
on their way here right now,

79
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,096
but before they arrive,
let's take a quick look

80
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,598
at these two most
deserving women.

81
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,838
- You deserve this.

82
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,207
You deserve this.
- No, you do.

83
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,442
Oh, my God.

84
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,245
I'm the Bachelorette!

85
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,346
One of two.

86
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,682
Insane.

87
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,418
Like, am I being pranked?

88
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,221
We're the Bachelorette!

89
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,023
- Oh, my gosh, together.
Together.

90
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,434
- Double the trouble.
- Double the...

91
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,960
I just feel so lucky.
I feel so lucky.

92
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,128
Oh, my God.

93
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:49,763
Gabby, how is this happening?

94
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,065
<i>I'm so thankful and so happy,</i>

95
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,633
because we are gonna find love.

96
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,402
Hi!

97
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,470
- Gals!

98
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,871
<i>- I couldn't be more excited.</i>

99
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:59,239
<i>Just seeing my family,</i>

100
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,974
<i>knowing that I have
such support,</i>

101
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,010
is more than I feel like
I could ever ask for.

102
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,645
- You're gonna do fine,
sweetheart.

103
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,024
- I love you.
- I love you, too, sweetheart.

104
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,783
<i>- I can't believe
I get the opportunity</i>

105
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,917
<i>to find love.</i>

106
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,453
I'm ready. I'm ready.

107
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,125
<i>This is crazy!</i>

108
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,293
Me and Gabby are
the Bachelorettes!

109
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,662
Yay!
- We love you guys!

110
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,632
<i>- We're both
so deserving of love,</i>

111
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,834
<i>especially after everything
we went through.</i>

112
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,678
<i>It was just
really heartbreaking.</i>

113
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,814
<i>Clayton broke up
with us together</i>

114
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,315
<i>because he was scared
to let us go</i>

115
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,583
<i>when he knew it was over.</i>

116
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,286
I've never felt pain
like this before.

117
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,757
- He told me he was
falling in love with me

118
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,259
and he told Rachel.

119
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,264
<i>What we went through
with Clayton,</i>

120
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,598
<i>it was torture.</i>

121
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,368
<i>And we were strung along.</i>

122
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,594
- I didn't want you to leave.

123
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,837
- But now you do.

124
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,314
So what the is the difference?

125
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,607
Except that one time,
it was gonna be my decision,

126
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,042
which you didn't want it to be,

127
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,178
and now it's your decision,
so it's easier.

128
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,679
- No.
- Yes, it is.

129
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,282
- I tried so hard.

130
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,550
I gave you everything,

131
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,552
I fought for this
every single day,

132
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,253
and you never once
fought for me.

133
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,621
You never did.

134
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,757
<i>I was really heartbroken,</i>

135
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,760
<i>but Gabby and I really picked
up the pieces for each other,</i>

136
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:31,431
and I'm so ready to start
this new chapter with her.

137
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,835
<i>- Just got back to Colorado,</i>

138
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,571
<i>and I have to prepare
for "The Bachelorette,"</i>

139
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,507
so I need to pack,
get my together,

140
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,043
organize, say goodbye to my dog,

141
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,544
all in a matter of 24 hours,

142
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,947
which seems insane,

143
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,315
but I'm so ready to do it.

144
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,284
Come give your mom a kiss.

145
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,588
I love you. I'm gonna miss you.

146
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,890
<i>- As crazy as this all is,</i>

147
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,625
I feel like I'm packed,

148
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,993
I'm ready to go,

149
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,528
get a good night's rest,

150
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,729
get on the plane,

151
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,232
<i>fly to LA, and see Gabby.</i>

152
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,172
<i>- Being the Bachelorette
hasn't even sunk in yet.</i>

153
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,506
<i>And I don't want it to,</i>

154
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,242
<i>because I think
the second it sinks in,</i>

155
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,543
<i>then I'll take it for granted.</i>

156
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,878
Oh, my God.

157
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,946
I think that's her.

158
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,815
It's all starting.

159
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,617
<i>Having Rachel by my side</i>

160
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,720
is truly the best thing that
I ever could have asked for.

161
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,122
It's Rachel!

162
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,825
<i>It's like going out
on a night on the town</i>

163
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:32,926
<i>with your best friend.</i>

164
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,329
Oh, my God!

165
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,932
<i>- I am so ready
to find love again,</i>

166
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,734
<i>and I'm so excited.</i>

167
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,235
We're the Bachelorette!

168
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,470
- I can't believe it.

169
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,806
<i>- I don't think there
is a doubt in my mind</i>

170
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,175
that Gabby and I are gonna find
our fiancés.

171
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,045
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

172
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:53,880
- Oh, my gosh.

173
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,749
This is where we're
gonna be living,

174
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,017
I can't believe it.

175
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,518
It's like a castle.

176
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,686
Oh, my God.

177
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,055
- Oh, I'm so happy
to be here with you.

178
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,024
It's gonna be so good.

179
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,592
Oh.

180
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,328
<i>- We've been through
the lowest of lows together,</i>

181
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,830
and I can't wait
for us to experience

182
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,899
the best moments
of our lives together.

183
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,367
- To us.

184
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,370
And finding love and enjoying
every second, hopefully.

185
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,638
- With each other.
- Yeah.

186
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,607
- I love you.
- I love you.

187
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,310
<i>I feel grateful
that two of us women get to be</i>

188
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,578
on this journey together
for the first time.

189
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,682
<i>I have a ton of questions,
but I'm so glad</i>

190
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,250
<i>that it's Rachel by my side.</i>

191
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,319
<i>It's gonna be crazy
and a weird journey,</i>

192
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,587
but I've never been more ready.

193
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,790
Bring on the men!

194
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,228
<i>- So it's time to turn the page</i>

195
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,130
<i>to the new season
of "The Bachelorette."</i>

196
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,132
<i>There's just one
important question.</i>

197
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,867
<i>Who will the next
Bachelorette be?</i>

198
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,503
- Come on, Jesse.
<i>- It's Gabby and Rachel!</i>

199
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,307
- Let's go!
- Double trouble!

200
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:56,576
- That is crazy!

201
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,643
- Yes!

202
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,045
- Wait, there's two Bach...

203
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,014
There are two Bachelorettes?

204
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,053
- I'm warmed up and ready
for a match made in heaven.

205
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,055
<i>- This is amazing...
I have two opportunities</i>

206
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,124
with two beautiful,
stunning women.

207
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,993
- Two Bachelorettes,
first season.

208
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,303
I don't know
how it's gonna work out,

209
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,495
but we gon' be there, though.

210
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,498
- I have to try to impress
two women.

211
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,167
- I cannot wait to come meet
the both of y'all.

212
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,369
Rambo, are you excited?

213
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,104
We're both really excited.

214
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,438
- Bye, guys. I love you.

215
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,983
- Bye, Mom. Love you.
- Have a great time.

216
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,542
- I'm on my way to meet
Gabby and Rachel.

217
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,611
<i>Here we go!</i>

218
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,046
- What if I like both the girls?

219
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,323
Like, what if both the girls
like me?

220
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,281
Like, I hope.

221
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,348
<i>So many questions.</i>

222
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,817
- Gabby!

223
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,119
Rachel!

224
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,120
<i>- I'm excited,</i>

225
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,422
<i>but there's two Bachelorettes.</i>

226
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,923
How is this gonna work?

227
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,061
<i>- I'm so ready
to meet these guys.</i>

228
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,229
- God, me too.

229
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,498
We're gonna be
on, like, cloud 11.

230
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,533
- I know.
But how do we do it?

231
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,877
- Especially when
there's so many men

232
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,069
at the beginning.
- Yes!

233
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,771
- I don't know if they're
gonna go in

234
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,173
with an idea of maybe who...

235
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,520
- Yeah.
- They aligned with more,

236
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,943
watching our journey,
and then moving forward.

237
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,081
I am curious to see which guys
we like in the beginning

238
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,816
and see if things will change

239
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,794
'cause I'm sure there's gonna
be overlap in the beginning.

240
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,320
- Of course, 'cause we have
to get to know everyone.

241
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,022
- Wait, okay,
so what's your type?

242
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,625
- I was just about to ask you.

243
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,461
I normally go for, like, guys
who are, like, taller,

244
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,696
more athletic.

245
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,574
But yeah, it really just
depends on personality.

246
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,434
I've never really dated
a guy who has, like,

247
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,735
made me laugh.

248
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:29,912
So I feel like sense of humor,

249
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,604
I know for you,
is really big too.

250
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,739
- Yeah.
- What about you?

251
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,474
Like, do you have, like, a type?

252
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,009
- I've dated them all.

253
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,211
I've dated the short kings,

254
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,713
the tall ones, the funny ones...

255
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,224
- Short kings.
- The plain ones,

256
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,451
the smart ones, the dumb ones.

257
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,419
It really... I've done it all.

258
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,955
But I want to be with someone
who can make a decision.

259
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,658
It was clear Clayton didn't
know what the he wanted

260
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,726
and was bouncing,
bouncing, bouncing,

261
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,395
and I know what I want,

262
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,597
and you know
what you deserve too.

263
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:01,201
We've learned so much
and just got so much stronger

264
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,570
by going through
what we did go through,

265
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,638
so I think it'll only benefit us

266
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,774
and having each other
moving forward.

267
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,943
- And I'm so happy
to share it with you.

268
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,211
- Me too.
- I'm so ready

269
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,146
to be standing on that driveway
with you,

270
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,981
meeting... how many guys?

271
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,950
- Yeah.
- Like, how ma... 30?

272
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,318
- Maybe they'll play 40.

273
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,652
- 50?
- 60!

274
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,988
The sky's the limit.

275
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,590
Too many is never enough.

276
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,460
I need options.

277
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:30,263
- I really love
having Gabby by my side,

278
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,632
but I just don't know
how this is gonna work.

279
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,601
<i>How are we supposed
to navigate feelings</i>

280
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,402
<i>when there's two people
involved?</i>

281
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,813
If they're saying
the same things to us,

282
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,281
like, what do we do then?
- To both of us?

283
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,540
- Yeah.
- I'm sure someone's

284
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,108
gonna try and play our ass.

285
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,443
I have no doubt.
- Mm-hmm.

286
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,044
I don't trust men.

287
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,213
- Not all of them, anyway.

288
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,482
<i>After everything with Clayton,</i>

289
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,885
<i>men have rightfully earned</i>

290
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,320
not being able to be trusted.

291
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,655
Shall we?
- Let's go get ready.

292
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,290
<i>- But I'm a romantic</i>

293
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,726
and I do want
a happily ever after,

294
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,896
and I hope that I can meet
my future husband tonight.

295
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,266
<i>- Dating the same guys</i>

296
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,368
is definitely
gonna be challenging.

297
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,803
<i>This has never been done before,</i>

298
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,272
but with two of us,

299
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,474
I guess we're just gonna
have to figure it out.

300
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,708
Oh, my gosh.

301
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:16,976
- You look incredible.

302
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,512
- You look amazing.

303
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,080
- Oh!

304
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,917
<i>I am so ready
for this chapter in my life.</i>

305
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,952
I'm ready to have a family,

306
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,420
to meet my partner,

307
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,923
and I hope
that all begins tonight.

308
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,291
- Should we go?
- Let's do it!

309
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,568
- Should we go
meet our husbands?

310
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:33,826
Let's do it!

311
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,228
<i>- Hopefully I meet my husband,</i>

312
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,405
and hopefully
it's not the same one

313
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,797
that Rachel wants.

314
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,499
- Look out, Bachelor Mansion.

315
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,034
- That's right.
- We're coming back.

316
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,944
<i>- Tonight is the night.</i>

317
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,345
<i>We've got two Bachelorettes.</i>

318
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,147
I have no idea
how this is gonna work,

319
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,416
so I'm going into it
with a super open mind.

320
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,893
<i>- I'm just down to see
who I connect with.</i>

321
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,695
There's nothing I can control
with all these unknowns,

322
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,999
so I might as well just enjoy it

323
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,522
and see what happens.

324
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:03,890
- Rachel, Gabby,

325
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,025
I'm gonna shimmy
into your heart tonight.

326
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,293
<i>It's gonna be a challenge,</i>

327
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,929
but I couldn't have asked
for a more wild ride.

328
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,368
- We are literally going
to two women right now.

329
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,569
- Two gorgeous women.

330
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,914
- They're two different
personalities.

331
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,015
- Two different personalities.

332
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,407
- How is this gonna work?

333
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,443
- I think it's definitely
gonna be unpredictable.

334
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,954
- It's gonna be
a little chaotic, I think.

335
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,258
- I think it's gonna be awesome.

336
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,216
- Rachel and Gabby are
about to arrive,

337
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,418
and they'll be meeting
all of the men together,

338
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,820
right here, tonight.

339
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,755
And I'm really hoping
that they've talked about

340
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,624
how to make
this unusual journey work

341
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,891
for the both of them.

342
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,336
I guess we'll see
what they've come up with,

343
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,694
but what I do know

344
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,564
is that there could not be
two more deserving women.

345
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,933
So please welcome not one

346
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,935
but two Bachelorettes,

347
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,204
Gabby and Rachel.

348
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:58,011
We're the Bachelorettes!

349
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,780
There he is!

350
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:03,216
- Jesse!
- Jesse!

351
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,386
Oh, my God.

352
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,920
- Okay, let's go.

353
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,959
- Oh, my gosh.

354
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,200
- You both look fantastic.

355
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,511
- Thank you.
- Rachel, so good seeing you.

356
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,636
How have you been?

357
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,143
- So good to see you.
- Welcome back.

358
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,606
Gabby, how are you?
- Good.

359
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:27,983
How are you?
- So great seeing you.

360
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,410
I'm doing amazing.
How are you both doing?

361
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,844
- Excited.
- Yes.

362
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,246
- Nervous.
- Incredibly nervous.

363
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,281
But we're ready.
- Is one person

364
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,283
making the other one
more nervous?

365
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,851
No, I feel...

366
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,162
- She's giving me
more confidence.

367
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,754
- Yeah.
- You're both here

368
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,356
as Bachelorettes.

369
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,724
How crazy is that?

370
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,027
- I think the best-case
scenario was, you know,

371
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,829
being the Bachelorette
after everything.

372
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,331
But knowing Rachel is by my side

373
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,866
and having a friend
was icing on the cake

374
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,336
and something I didn't
even know to ask for.

375
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,304
So I'm so excited

376
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,206
and so grateful.
- Me too.

377
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,617
- You're both gonna hold hands
the entire time too?

378
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,743
We're not gonna let go.

379
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,346
- I was gonna say,
you're holding on tight.

380
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,914
- Yeah.

381
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,158
- So obviously, you know,
we've never done

382
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,516
anything like this before.

383
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,685
Two Bachelorettes
for an entire season.

384
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,721
How is this whole thing
gonna work?

385
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,622
- We're just gonna be learning
along the way.

386
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,100
Of course, we're gonna make
some mistakes,

387
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,259
but I have her to help me, so...

388
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,561
- Yeah.
- Think we'll be okay.

389
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,863
- You're about to date
the most men...

390
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,131
- The most?
- We've ever had

391
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,467
in a single season.
- This is crazy.

392
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,777
- Wow, I like the sound of that.

393
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,470
- Does that sound okay?
- It sounds okay.

394
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,780
I still don't believe it.
- Think you can handle it?

395
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,873
- I can handle it, maybe.
- I think we're ready.

396
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,042
- Yeah.
- We're ready to go.

397
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,478
- All right.
Well, the time's finally come.

398
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,879
The first limo's pulling up.

399
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,215
- Oh, my gosh.

400
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,983
Oh!

401
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,284
Gabby...

402
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,986
Rachel...

403
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,521
- Let the journey begin.

404
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,524
Let's do this!

405
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,525
Oh, my God.

406
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,727
- Oh, my gosh.

407
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,129
- How do I look?

408
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,864
- Good.

409
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,435
- All right.
Anxiety attack, here we go.

410
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,003
Wow.

411
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,071
- Yeah!
- Come on, now.

412
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,808
- Yeah, tick, tick, tick, tick!

413
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,243
- Let's go, baby!

414
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,512
Gabby and Rachel!

415
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,316
- Come on.

416
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,192
- Hello.
- Hi.

417
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,627
- Hello.

418
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,995
- How's it going?

419
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,297
Couldn't be better.

420
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,808
- Yeah.
- That's good to hear.

421
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,001
- Couldn't be better.
This is so exciting.

422
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,269
And I just have to say,

423
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,538
you two look
absolutely phenomenal.

424
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,307
I feel like the luckiest guy
to be here,

425
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,043
and I can't wait
to get to know you both.

426
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,846
- Does the luckiest guy
have a name?

427
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,314
- He does.

428
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:51,350
My name is Zach,
and it's an absolute pleasure.

429
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,785
And I can tell you this.

430
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,263
We're gonna have
a hell of a time together.

431
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,055
- Yeah, we're excited.
- Excited.

432
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,332
- I'm gonna go for a hug
'cause I'm a hugger.

433
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,258
- Nice. We're huggers too.

434
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,927
- Okay, perfect. Perfect.

435
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,638
- Nice to meet you, Zach.
- Nice to meet you.

436
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,263
Well, it was awesome
meeting y'all,

437
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,365
and I can't wait to continue
this journey.

438
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,934
- See you inside.
- Sounds good.

439
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,502
We'll see you soon.
- See you.

440
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,104
He's cute.

441
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,773
- Yeah.
- Very cute.

442
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,174
We're off to a good start.

443
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,420
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Jason.

444
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,922
- Gabby.
- So nice to meet you.

445
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,391
- Jason, Rachel.
- So nice to meet you.

446
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,495
So there's something
I gotta get off my chest.

447
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,663
I've got something in common
with Clayton.

448
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,131
- Oh, no, that's not

449
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,399
what we want to hear.
- Yeah.

450
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,301
- I'm in love with three women.

451
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,636
- Uh-huh.

452
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,104
- My mom,

453
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,339
my sister,

454
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,940
and my dog, Kiera.

455
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,343
- Oh, what kind of dog?
- That's okay.

456
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,012
- Husky.
- Oh, my gosh, how sweet.

457
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,114
- Yeah.
It's so nice to meet you guys.

458
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,016
- You too.
- So excited to see you inside.

459
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,518
- Yes, we'll see you soon.

460
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,952
- We're excited
to see you inside.

461
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,855
- You girls look beautiful.
- Thank you.

462
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,490
- He's my type.

463
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,626
- He's cute.
- Yeah.

464
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,297
- Ooh. Wow.

465
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,633
Hello.
- Hello.

466
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,001
- Hi.
- How are you guys?

467
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,645
- Good. How are you?
- It's nice to meet you.

468
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,437
I'm Aven. How are you guys?
- Gabby.

469
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,515
Nice... oh.
- So nice to...

470
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,007
Rachel, how are you?

471
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,675
So nice to finally
meet you guys.

472
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,777
I just wanted to say, you know,
when I found out

473
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,212
it was gonna be the both of you,

474
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,248
I could tell that you both are
really close to family,

475
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,117
which is very, very
important to me as well.

476
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,818
So I wanted to say,
individually,

477
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,086
to each one of you,

478
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,321
Gabby...

479
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,089
I promise to do right by you

480
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,424
throughout this whole journey

481
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,102
because I want to make
your grandfather proud.

482
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:41,870
And I really mean that.
- You're so sweet. Thank you.

483
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,397
- And Rachel,
I promise to do right by you

484
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,198
because I definitely
don't want to end up

485
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,000
on Big Tony's bad side.

486
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,869
You do not.

487
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,137
- It was so nice to meet you.

488
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,648
- So nice to meet you.
- I'll see you inside.

489
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,273
- You look gorgeous.
- That's great.

490
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,309
You guys look amazing.
- Yes. Thank you.

491
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,586
- Awesome.
I'll see you guys inside.

492
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,712
- Sounds good.

493
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,747
- He was cute.
- That was cute.

494
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,884
Nice work.

495
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,188
- Hey, ladies.
- Hi.

496
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,657
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

497
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,559
- I'm doing fabulous.
My name's Jordan.

498
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,662
- Gabby. Nice to meet you.
- Jordan, Rachel.

499
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,331
Nice to meet you.

500
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,175
- So when I found out there
would be two Bachelorettes,

501
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,367
I got a little nervous.

502
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,544
I wasn't quite sure
how I was gonna speak

503
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,737
to two beautiful women
at the same time.

504
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,238
So I brought these.

505
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,441
- Okay.
- Oh.

506
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,942
- Uh-oh. Okay.

507
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,944
- I know family is a big part
of your life.

508
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,713
And I only live
about an hour from you.

509
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,349
So if we end up together
in the end of this,

510
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,017
maybe you won't have
to move too far.

511
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,720
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

512
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,930
- Gabby, it's your turn.
- Oh, are you done?

513
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,422
I didn't hear a thing.

514
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,496
- I know
you're an excellent nurse.

515
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,365
I've broken plenty of bones,

516
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,834
so I spent my fair share of
time in the hospital as well.

517
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,945
So maybe you're my all-star
nurse that I've never had.

518
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,038
Yeah.

519
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,307
<i>- This is so crazy</i>

520
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,609
<i>having all these guys get out
of the limo for us.</i>

521
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,478
<i>I was nervous
coming into tonight.</i>

522
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,781
<i>No one knew what this was
gonna be like</i>

523
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,082
<i>with two Bachelorettes,</i>

524
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,917
but they're really going
out of their way

525
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,553
to make Gabby and I
feel special individually.

526
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,623
- I think you two are
absolutely wonderful women.

527
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,559
I feel so fortunate to join you
on this journey.

528
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,762
<i>- There has never been
two Bachelorettes before.</i>

529
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,998
<i>And I'm sure
it's not easy to know,</i>

530
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,133
who do I hug first?

531
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,068
Who do I look at first
and address?

532
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,170
- This is surreal.
- They look stunning.

533
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,205
I was kind of thrown off
a little bit.

534
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,512
- I didn't know who to talk to.

535
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,377
- So welcome to a night
you'll never forget.

536
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,146
I'm here to meet
my Bachelorette.

537
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,448
<i>- I mean, it has to be
extremely intimidating</i>

538
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,017
<i>to walk up to not one of us,
but two of us.</i>

539
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,585
But they're doing
a really great job.

540
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,187
- Rachel and Gabby, okay.

541
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,656
- Oh, we have a dancer
on our hands!

542
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,692
- Rachel and Gabby, okay.

543
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,360
- Having two females
is interesting,

544
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,204
but I think just making sure
they have their own

545
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,897
individualized experience
is important.

546
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,403
It's all about
that first impression.

547
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,267
- Oh!
- Oh!

548
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,501
Nice.

549
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,737
Clearly I'm not good
at juggling two women.

550
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,372
However, I promise you,

551
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,507
I could be quite the catch.

552
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,676
<i>- These guys knew
that they had to step it up,</i>

553
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,845
and I am not disappointed.

554
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,432
- You gotta give it
everything you got,

555
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,116
'cause this right here
is our time.

556
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,584
So let's go out and take it.

557
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:23,389
<i>- So far, the experiment
of two Bachelorettes</i>

558
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:24,924
<i>is going really well,</i>

559
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,893
and we are off
to an excellent start.

560
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,196
- Let's go.
- That's right!

561
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,064
- Get those boys in there
pumped up.

562
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,131
- Let's go.

563
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:37,679
<i>- All right, here's the deal.</i>

564
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,105
This is gonna be a long season.

565
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,506
Two girls.
- Yeah.

566
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,807
- It's gonna be fun, though.

567
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,185
You can't even imagine
something better.

568
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,210
So you've got to go at it

569
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,554
with everything you got.
- All right.

570
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,822
- Because right here,
this is what matters.

571
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,180
- Hey, cheers to that.
- Cheers.

572
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,591
- Cheers to that, Coach Kirk.
- Yes, cheers to that.

573
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,716
Cheers.

574
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:51,817
- Yo, we're here.
- Hey!

575
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,719
- Oh, my gosh.

576
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,988
- Let's go. Let's go.
It's game time

577
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,690
Rachel! Gabby!

578
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,258
Rachel! Gabby!

579
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,193
Rachel! Gabby!
- Oh!

580
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,095
Louder.

581
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,500
- Let's go.

582
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,970
- Thank you, sir.

583
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,207
Hello, ladies.

584
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,274
- No.
- Oh, my God.

585
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,676
- Oh, I thought that was a rat.

586
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,812
- How are you doing today?
- Good!

587
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,389
- It's good to meet you.
Before I hug you,

588
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,682
I wanted to introduce you
to a couple of my friends.

589
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,560
When I heard there was gonna be
two Bachelorettes,

590
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,453
I figured I should practice
hanging out

591
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,997
with a couple of cute chicks
all the time, right?

592
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,022
- Aww.

593
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,390
- I love it.
- So here they are.

594
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,792
This is Mary Beth.

595
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,860
- Is it sweet?
- Yeah, she's great.

596
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,295
- Mary Beth?
- This is Alejandra.

597
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:37,773
- Alejandra.
- Alejandra's had an attitude,

598
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,799
but she's doing great now.
- Oh, that's my girl.

599
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,105
An attitude.
- My name is Logan.

600
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,468
- Logan.
- Oh.

601
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,012
- Can they fly?
- No, Gabby.

602
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,938
- No, they can't.
- No, no, no, no!

603
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,706
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
- I'll take Alejandra.

604
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,176
No, it's cool.
It's cool, it's cool.

605
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,553
You know what,
we're so happy to be here,

606
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,345
all three of us.
I'll see you inside.

607
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,480
- You look great.

608
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,015
- Can I give you a hug?
- Of course.

609
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,751
I'm so sorry. I don't know why.

610
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,252
- Good to meet you, Logan.

611
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,321
- Great to meet you.
I'll see you inside.

612
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:04,423
Cute, cute.

613
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,125
- I know. Bye, birdies.

614
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,199
- Ooh.

615
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,700
- Hello.
- As to you.

616
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,436
- Hello. Wow.

617
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:21,774
My name is Quincy,

618
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,909
AKA Prince.

619
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,177
- Prince. Okay.

620
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,112
- And, you know,
based on everything

621
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,747
that's happened to you,
I'm a person

622
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,616
that is very intentional.

623
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,018
And just, you know, a little
background story of me,

624
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,987
how intentional I am, is,

625
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:39,491
You know, I haven't had sex
in a year and almost a half,

626
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,961
so I've been saving it
for the right person.

627
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,362
And I can't wait to see

628
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,873
where this journey
kind of takes us from here.

629
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,066
But I would def love
to give you guys a hug.

630
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,068
- So nice to meet you.
- Thank you, Prince.

631
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,579
- Thank you.
You girls have a nice one.

632
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,671
- We'll see you inside.
- You too.

633
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,139
He hit the word intentional.

634
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,641
- Yeah, he was like,

635
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,952
"I haven't had sex
in a year and a half,"

636
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,336
I was like,
"That makes one of us."

637
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,779
Do you know
who you're talking to?

638
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:01,846
Yeah.

639
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,318
- Hello.

640
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,287
- Y'all look so pretty tonight.

641
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,421
- Thank you.
- Of course.

642
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:10,632
I'm Hayden.
- You look great too.

643
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:11,933
Gabby.
- Nice to meet you, Gabby.

644
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,093
- Hayden, Rachel.
- Rachel.

645
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,361
Wow.

646
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,662
So my name's Hayden.

647
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,664
And I know that does sound
a lot like Clayton.

648
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,965
Okay?

649
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,634
But what I'm gonna do
differently is,

650
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,269
I'm gonna be thinking
with this head

651
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,503
and not that one.

652
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,705
- Oh!
- We appreciate that.

653
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,107
Yeah.

654
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,775
<i>Hayden gets me with the joke</i>

655
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:31,277
<i>'cause I'm 12 years old,</i>

656
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,579
<i>but he makes a nod to Clayton,</i>

657
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,714
<i>and it is pretty funny,</i>

658
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:39,218
<i>but this is the beginning
of our new journey,</i>

659
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:42,021
so it's just
the wrong time for it.

660
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,224
- Hear me out.
I know what it looks like.

661
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,459
I am not Clayton.

662
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,828
Gab, Rach, come here.

663
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,330
<i>- But the guys, I feel like,</i>

664
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:53,232
<i>feel like they need
to bring up Clayton</i>

665
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,700
<i>because it's so fresh.</i>

666
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,468
And hearing
all this Clayton stuff,

667
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,203
it's kind of like...

668
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:10,983
<i>- These guys
keep bringing up Clayton,</i>

669
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,520
and I think Gabby and I are...

670
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:18,657
okay with not hearing
Clayton's name again tonight.

671
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,806
- Did you guys write this
yourself?

672
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,111
- Whoa.

673
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,425
- Whoo!
- Aww.

674
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,712
- Hello, hello.
- Hi!

675
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,885
- Might be a good idea.

676
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,260
And remember...

677
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,169
Amazing!

678
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:39,371
- Thank you.

679
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:41,006
- Hi, I'm Alec.

680
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:43,275
- Gabby. Nice to meet you.
- Gabby? Nice to meet you.

681
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:44,643
- Alec, Rachel.
- Rachel.

682
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,811
Nice to meet you. I'm Alec.

683
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,055
- I just want to let y'all know,

684
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,623
I'm really happy
and grateful to be here

685
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,549
on "The Bachelorette"
with y'all,

686
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,384
and I hope this was
a first impression

687
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,652
that y'all will never forget.

688
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,055
- I don't think we could.
- It was. I know.

689
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,990
They were great.
We appreciate it.

690
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,359
<i>- Alec definitely made
an impression.</i>

691
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,228
<i>The choir was probably the
most creative entrance so far,</i>

692
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,030
and probably the only time
we're okay

693
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,698
with hearing
Clayton's name tonight.

694
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,301
- I don't know if y'all saw,
I had a little choir come out.

695
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,578
They were clutch.
- That's what that was?

696
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,104
- Yeah.
<i>- Are you serious?</i>

697
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,440
<i>At first I thought my chickens
were, like, a big deal,</i>

698
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:17,576
but now I really don't know
how I'm gonna measure up.

699
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,114
- Oh, it's a meatball sub.
- You like meatball subs!

700
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,683
- I hope you're hungry.
- Holy.

701
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,852
How many meatballs
are on that sucker?

702
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:27,996
- You both look incredible.

703
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,621
- Thank you.
- You look great,

704
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,458
especially with a large
meatball sub in your hands.

705
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:33,968
- Oh, yeah.
- Have you done this before?

706
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,494
You look like a natural.

707
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:36,895
- Thank you.

708
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:39,565
Well, my name is James.
I'm from Chicago.

709
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,400
They call me Meatball.
It's my nickname.

710
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,103
But anyways,
I'm just glad to be here

711
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,804
and very excited
to meet you both.

712
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:47,806
Nice.

713
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:49,475
- So I'll see you inside.
- Okay.

714
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,376
- See you.
- We'll see you inside, James.

715
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,145
- Nice work, James.
- Oh, no.

716
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,847
- You handle those balls
so well.

717
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,424
- You think you can get it
through the door?

718
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,616
- I got it.
Don't worry.

719
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,151
Yeah.

720
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,487
- I can't wait for
the other guys to see it.

721
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,489
- Whoa! Is that a hoagie?
Look at that thing.

722
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,657
- I got dinner
for tonight, guys.

723
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,359
- That's the hugest thing
I've ever seen.

724
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:09,461
- MVP of the night.
- Look at that thing.

725
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,372
- Meatball sandwich.
- Bringing that's impressive.

726
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:14,233
- This is... this is a...
This is a big sub.

727
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,101
<i>The meatball sandwich
is a little odd,</i>

728
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,036
but it's different
and it stood out.

729
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:19,881
- Oh, yeah, Meatball.
Hell of a meatball, Meatball.

730
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:21,373
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Let's go, baby.

731
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,884
<i>- I feel like all these dudes
are trying super hard</i>

732
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,811
to, you know, have some sort
of clever first impression.

733
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:28,547
- I know tonight
is a very exciting night,

734
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:31,850
and with that comes
a lot of nervous energy.

735
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:36,054
So I decided I would show up
a little extra grounded.

736
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,690
- I mean, we got a lot
of unique characters

737
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:39,992
in the building.

738
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,636
- Lost your sneaks out there?
What happened?

739
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,095
- Somebody stole them, you know,

740
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,696
just before I came in.

741
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,107
- Hopefully,
you get 'em back, man.

742
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,432
- Yeah, right?

743
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,569
- But not quite sure he put
his best foot forward,

744
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,905
if you know what I mean.

745
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,573
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God.

746
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,642
Wow!

747
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,210
Is that the Blue Man Group?

748
00:27:58,277 --> 00:27:59,945
You're really working that suit.

749
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,381
- That's different.

750
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:03,916
Wow, people are definitely

751
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,117
throwing out all the stops.

752
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,586
- The reveal.
- Yeah.

753
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:09,154
- Oh, wow.

754
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,856
Hello!
- What's up?

755
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:12,424
- You know,
really creative stuff.

756
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:14,493
- Ladies, yes, as a magician,

757
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,528
I was thinking of starting
with a card trick.

758
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,130
But honestly...

759
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,498
- Oh!
- Oh!

760
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:21,242
- I'm not quite sure
I want to do magic right now.

761
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,178
I just want to spend the time
to get to know you both.

762
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,170
So hello. I'm Roby.
- Oh, wow.

763
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,272
- I mean, the way
you come in matters.

764
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,440
First impressions matter.

765
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:29,975
- Can you please do
a trick for me?

766
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,143
- No pressure, Roby.

767
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,344
Let's do it.

768
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:33,812
Oh, !

769
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,480
That's nice.

770
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,149
<i>- There's definitely magic
in the air.</i>

771
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,218
<i>I mean, hopefully they keep me
around long enough</i>

772
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,628
<i>so that I can do
more tricks for them.</i>

773
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,054
Because getting out of that limo

774
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,388
is so nerve-racking.

775
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,756
- Hey, y'all.

776
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,725
- Hi.
- Hello.

777
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:47,993
- Hey, Rachel.

778
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,494
I'm sorry, Gabby.

779
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,963
- No worries.

780
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,998
Yeah. Yeah.
- What's your name?

781
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,300
<i>- Oh, my gosh.
I messed up their names.</i>

782
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:56,778
I think that's
a great first impression.

783
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:58,780
I mean... no, actually, it's
a terrible first impression,

784
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,572
but I think it could...

785
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:01,873
It's a big impression.

786
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,409
It's a big impression.

787
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,213
- Oh, my God.

788
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,548
What the hell?

789
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:11,316
- Wait, what the... what?
- Oh, snap. Hey.

790
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:13,452
- What is that?
- Oh, my gosh.

791
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,120
- Hello!
- Wow.

792
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:19,625
- How's it going?
- Couldn't be better.

793
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,164
Let me just say...

794
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,600
you two look "forking" gorgeous.

795
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:31,670
Thank you.

796
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:32,838
- Hi, ladies.
- Hello.

797
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,439
- Hi.
- I'm... do we hug?

798
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:35,540
- Yes!
- Yeah.

799
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,975
- It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

800
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,553
- Do we have a name?
- Nice to meet you.

801
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,412
- So I'm Tino.

802
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,114
I do work in construction,

803
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,449
so that means
I'm good with my hands.

804
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,084
- Okay.
- And I'm just

805
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,452
so excited to be here

806
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,297
and build something
really special with you guys.

807
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:50,355
- Aww.
- I like it.

808
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:51,690
- We're excited too.

809
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:52,691
- It was so nice to meet you.

810
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:54,092
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Yes.

811
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,370
I can't wait to talk to you
guys on the other side.

812
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:56,804
- Yes, have fun.
- Yeah, we're excited.

813
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:59,064
We'll see you soon.

814
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,099
- I've been waiting
for a handyman.

815
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,534
- Yeah.

816
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:03,769
- He's my type.

817
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,804
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

818
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,407
<i>I'm immediately attracted
to Tino.</i>

819
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,543
<i>I don't really think anyone
can top Tino's entrance,</i>

820
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,246
but we have no idea
what's to come.

821
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,248
So I'm ready for a surprise.

822
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:19,318
Oh, my goodness.

823
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:20,552
- What?

824
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:21,753
Oh.

825
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,423
- It looks like a romance
novel over there.

826
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,658
Is that Fabio?

827
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:31,430
- Oh, my goodness.

828
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,333
Is that Fabio?
- Yeah.

829
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,201
- Nah, what?
- What is going on?

830
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:37,979
- I think I just saw this guy
on a commercial.

831
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,172
Is this the Old Spice guy?

832
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,306
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wow.

833
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:42,307
- Ladies.
- Hello!

834
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:43,742
- Wow!
- Hello, hello.

835
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,546
Whoa.

836
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,649
I know this looks like a cover
to a romantic novel,

837
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:53,452
but I'm only here
for a happy ending.

838
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:55,954
- Um...
- We're here for that.

839
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,789
Yeah.

840
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,334
- All right, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

841
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,625
- At least he's fit.

842
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,194
I like the hair.

843
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,462
He gonna get chilly.

844
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,730
- Nice to meet you.

845
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,064
Hi.

846
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,332
- I'm a little bit, uh...

847
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,734
- Oiled up?
- Oiled up!

848
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,901
- You know what, I could...

849
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,103
I could use some...
- Yeah.

850
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,071
Wipe some on!
- Yeah!

851
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:14,773
I could use some of that.

852
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,608
I'm kind of dry these days.

853
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,110
- Me too.
- Yeah.

854
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,478
- So my name's Jacob,

855
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,746
and I'll see you guys inside.

856
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,292
- We'll see you inside.
- Sounds good.

857
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,882
- Nice to meet you.
- Thanks, Jacob.

858
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:25,484
Are you gonna take
your horse with you?

859
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,586
- Uh, Blanco?
Come with?

860
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,287
No? All right.
- Blanco, quick, quick!

861
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,655
- I'll see you next time, okay?

862
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,125
- He doesn't follow commands
very well.

863
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,940
Oh.

864
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,063
- Yeah.

865
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,607
Ah, down under!

866
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,833
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't choose this life.

867
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,402
This life chose me.

868
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,070
- Ah.

869
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:48,006
<i>- Wow, this dude rides in
on a horse.</i>

870
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,976
He looks like
he came out of, like,

871
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,511
some romance novel.

872
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,879
- We don't need no more men.

873
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,848
I think there's a lot
of masculinity inside.

874
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,950
<i>I mean, where does it end?</i>

875
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,152
There's so many of us.

876
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,287
- Seriously,
you both are stunning.

877
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:03,698
Absolutely beautiful,
and I can't wait

878
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:04,962
to get to know you guys inside.

879
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,701
- We can't wait either.
- So yeah. Absolutely.

880
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,860
<i>- Right when I think
we're wrapping up,</i>

881
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:09,961
more roll in.

882
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,363
- You familiar
with this material?

883
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,798
It's husband material.

884
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,232
- Oh!
- Oh!

885
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,977
- How many more people
you guys think are coming?

886
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,169
- It's the unknown.

887
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,639
- Twins!
- Hello.

888
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,907
- Hello.
- Amazing.

889
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,842
- This is perfect.
- Hello. How are you guys?

890
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:25,076
- Hello.
- I'm seeing double.

891
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,978
- How are you?
- Twins?

892
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,113
No!

893
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,781
- All right, y'all... hey.

894
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,783
- So I'm wondering
when it's gonna stop

895
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,351
and when they're gonna,
you know,

896
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,220
cut us off here.

897
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,755
- Oh.
- Oh. Oh.

898
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,056
Mic drop?

899
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,324
- Yeah.
- Okay.

900
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,071
- That's right, I did that.
- To the floor?

901
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,297
- It's gonna be a long night.

902
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,033
- So I know that
a long night in heels...

903
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,334
- Oh, thank you.
- Can be...

904
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,012
- This might be the best
introduction we've seen.

905
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,413
- Yeah, of course.
- A front-row seat.

906
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,748
- Yeah, I have a mother
and a sister,

907
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,807
so I know
how long nights can be.

908
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:56,975
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

909
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:58,643
I'll see you both inside.
- Oh!

910
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,644
Can we keep these chairs?
- Yeah.

911
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,379
That was it?

912
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,614
- That's it.

913
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:03,891
I just wanted
to give you guys a breather

914
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,159
from being on your feet.
- Oh, that's so nice!

915
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:06,718
- Oh, thank you.
We appreciate it.

916
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,887
- We'll be taking these chairs
with us everywhere.

917
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,288
Bye, Spencer.

918
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,390
- See you guys.
- See you soon.

919
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,825
- I liked him.
- What a gentleman.

920
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:15,260
- He's my type.

921
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,129
- Oh, he's cute.
- Yeah.

922
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:19,731
<i>I think Spencer is really cute</i>

923
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:21,366
<i>and he has great style.</i>

924
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:22,701
- Cute, cute, cute.

925
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,767
Good...
- I know.

926
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,203
- Good limo.
- Yeah.

927
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,771
<i>I hope Rachel's not into him</i>

928
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,374
<i>because I want
to get to know him.</i>

929
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,809
<i>But, you know,
there's so many men,</i>

930
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,144
<i>there's two of us,
and it's clear that</i>

931
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,747
we're going to be attracted
to the same guys.

932
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:37,225
- I honestly feel like
the luckiest guy

933
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,826
in the world right now,
standing in front of you two.

934
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,653
And I can confidently say two
is definitely better than one.

935
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,222
- Yeah.
- Of course.

936
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,558
<i>- I mean, it's gonna get
pretty tricky,</i>

937
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,060
and I think
there's going to be hardship

938
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,062
with dating
the same pool of men.

939
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,341
- You know, this is history in
the making, two Bachelorettes.

940
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,800
Like, how is this gonna work?
You know what I'm saying?

941
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,104
- If two of them ultimately
end up being into, like, one,

942
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,306
that's gonna be, like,
a real interesting scenario.

943
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,975
- This morning, I woke up,

944
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,678
I opened my eyes, and...

945
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,580
Oh!

946
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,048
- I see you, Rachel,

947
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:12,884
and you, Gabby.

948
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,786
- Nice!
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

949
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:17,289
But now that I have met
you guys,

950
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,524
I will say the real thing
is much better.

951
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,892
<i>- This is crazy.</i>

952
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,328
<i>I have no idea
how this is gonna work.</i>

953
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,930
<i>It worries me a little bit</i>

954
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,599
because I definitely feel like
Gabby and I

955
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,000
could fall for the same guys.

956
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,869
- I am a professional
race car driver.

957
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:32,070
- Oh, wow.

958
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:33,497
- So you could say
that I'm used to

959
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,206
some wild and crazy rides.

960
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,475
<i>- I mean, we only have so many
guys here we can date.</i>

961
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,011
We're gonna, obviously,
both like a couple of them.

962
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,880
- Do either of you guys know
how to tie a tie?

963
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,548
Please help me.
- Oh, I can maybe...

964
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:45,126
- Give it your best shot.
- Should I try?

965
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,118
<i>- I really hope
that doesn't happen,</i>

966
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,287
but of course
I want to remain open.

967
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:50,822
- Oh, perfect.
- Yeah.

968
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,991
- Just fold it down,
fold it back up.

969
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,993
Rachel, please help.

970
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,462
- Well, I look pretty good.

971
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,931
<i>- At the end of the day,
it is an individual journey.</i>

972
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:03,868
We both are here to find
our own individual husbands,

973
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,203
hopefully.

974
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:07,639
- All right.
Rachel, Gabby.

975
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:09,741
You've now met all 32 men.

976
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:12,143
I mean, that's a lot of guys
to meet in one night.

977
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,112
- It's a lot,
but we have each other.

978
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,614
- Right, we're willing

979
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,358
to take on the challenge!
- Divide and conquer!

980
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:18,717
- Yeah.

981
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,961
- It is a lot of guys, though.

982
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:21,419
For real, a lot of people here.

983
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,521
- The more competition,
the better, right?

984
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,757
<i>- The guys are all here
and it is crowded</i>

985
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,892
and hot in here,
that's for sure.

986
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,060
- You guys have a strategy

987
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,404
how you're gonna divide
and conquer?

988
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:31,472
- Yeah.
- Hopefully we can just

989
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,697
figure it out on the way.

990
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,032
See where the night takes us.

991
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,900
<i>- This is going to be wild.</i>

992
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,235
<i>There's two girls.</i>

993
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,637
<i>There's two.</i>

994
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,039
I can't even anticipate
what's gonna happen.

995
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:42,583
- I don't know
how these two Bachelorettes...

996
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:43,842
How this is gonna go.

997
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,553
There's a lot of questions
that's gonna happen

998
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,145
down the line for all of us.
- Yeah.

999
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,647
<i>- There's no precedent for this.</i>

1000
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,882
There's no basis for this
at all.

1001
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:53,318
- Having the two Bachelorettes
is legendary.

1002
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,787
It's also gonna create
some drama, for sure.

1003
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,856
<i>- Naturally, as men,
we're territorial,</i>

1004
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,624
but we got two Bachelorettes.

1005
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,226
It's a different ball game.

1006
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,961
- It's definitely gonna be
double the fun,

1007
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:04,229
you know, double the action,

1008
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,998
double the chances
to find love, I feel like.

1009
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:09,567
<i>- So you gotta make it known
that you're a contender.</i>

1010
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,603
And guess what?
You're talking to Mario.

1011
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,272
Hey, we ready for whatever.

1012
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,041
We ready for whatever.

1013
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,642
- To history in the making here.

1014
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,644
We got Gabby and Rachel.

1015
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,980
"Bachelorette" season 19.
Let's do it, gentlemen.

1016
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,381
- Whoo!

1017
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,784
- Cheers.
- Let's go!

1018
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,922
- My heart has been
pounding nonstop

1019
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:32,357
ever since I've seen them both.

1020
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:33,758
And...
- Same.

1021
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,494
I'm just excited to talk,
get some words out there.

1022
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,129
- Like, rolling up in that limo,

1023
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,798
and there's two out there,
it's like...

1024
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,908
- Both beautiful.
- Both gorgeous.

1025
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,143
- I didn't even know what to do.

1026
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,968
- They're gonna marry
one of us, you know,

1027
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,071
whether it's, you know,
it's out here...

1028
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,972
Obviously me... or in there.

1029
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,309
- We're excited.
- Yeah.

1030
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,645
- Well, I know all these men
are so anxious

1031
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,489
to meet you all and get
a chance to sit down with you

1032
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:56,593
and get to know you better.

1033
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,083
I know you're also
very excited too.

1034
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,751
But before we get to that,

1035
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,063
I do want to talk you through
what's gonna happen tonight.

1036
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:04,047
So obviously, you're both gonna
go into the party.

1037
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,824
You're gonna have a chance,
both of you,

1038
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,592
to speak to every single one
of the guys,

1039
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,327
just like any other
Bachelorette would do.

1040
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,738
Now, later in the night,
obviously,

1041
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,263
there'll be
a First Impression Rose.

1042
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,730
- That's awesome.
- And you're gonna

1043
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,734
hand that out
to that special someone

1044
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,344
that you feel a really strong
connection with.

1045
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,403
- Oh, my goodness.

1046
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,238
This is crazy.
- Yeah, I know.

1047
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:22,774
- Get ready for the night
of your lives.

1048
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:23,942
Head on in.

1049
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,319
Gabby, Rachel, good luck.
- Let's do it!

1050
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,644
- Bye, Jesse!

1051
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,180
Oh, my God.

1052
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,250
<i>- Having two Bachelorettes
is crazy.</i>

1053
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:36,621
<i>I have absolutely no idea
how this is gonna work.</i>

1054
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,248
How does the First Impression
Rose work?

1055
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,900
What if we want to give it
to the same person?

1056
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,127
<i>There's so many questions
moving forward.</i>

1057
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,393
- Who are you guys gonna talk
to first, Gabby or Rachel?

1058
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,698
- I just want a chance
to showcase who I am

1059
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,067
to one or both of them,
honestly, on the first night.

1060
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:50,894
- You can't go wrong
with either one of them.

1061
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,411
- Finally!
- Whoo!

1062
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,213
- Wow, you guys look incredible.

1063
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,748
Thank you so much.
- Of course.

1064
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,483
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1065
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,418
- That's that
Southern hospitality there.

1066
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,053
- All right.
- Oh, my gosh, well,

1067
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,457
we are both
so excited to be here.

1068
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,993
- Yeah, we know what it's like
being in your guys' shoes.

1069
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,861
We were just there
not that long ago.

1070
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,568
- I think I was standing
right back there.

1071
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,066
- And we just want to say
thank you so much.

1072
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,169
We know, like, how much
of a sacrifice

1073
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,670
it is to be here.

1074
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,539
There's so much unknown,

1075
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,674
but the more you lean in, truly,

1076
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:31,276
the more you do get out.

1077
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:34,145
So I hope you guys can
trust us along the way.

1078
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:36,581
- Gabby and I,
we're both really confident

1079
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:40,051
that if you guys are open
and vulnerable

1080
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:43,021
and give us all
good communication,

1081
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,523
that love is here.

1082
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,559
- Yeah, as... I don't know
if you guys know,

1083
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,195
but this is the most men
we've ever had here.

1084
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,429
- We noticed.

1085
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,831
We noticed for sure.

1086
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,099
- The testosterone is flowing.

1087
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,401
- It feels good.

1088
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,203
Yeah!

1089
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,838
- But we are breaking new ground

1090
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,740
with two Bachelorettes
and with all of you guys,

1091
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,876
so I hope we're patient
with each other.

1092
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:07,145
- Yeah, we just look forward
to this journey.

1093
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:09,814
It's gonna be a wild ride.

1094
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,783
I'm ready.
- Let's do it!

1095
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,152
Should we cheers? Yes!

1096
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,154
Cheers!
- Cheers!

1097
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,422
- Cheers.

1098
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:18,590
- We'll get better at that.

1099
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:19,800
We'll get better at the cheers.

1100
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,193
Yeah, it's a lot at once.

1101
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,196
I honestly have no clue

1102
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:27,232
how the night's gonna work
having two of us.

1103
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,601
<i>I kind of just have
no expectations right now.</i>

1104
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,878
<i>I just want to have a good time,</i>

1105
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,303
<i>almost, like, get my feet wet</i>

1106
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,974
in the sense that I'm dating,
like, multiple guys.

1107
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,885
- Do y'all want to see
a couple of magic tricks?

1108
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,044
- Would love.
- All right.

1109
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,446
Do you guys remember my name?

1110
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:42,512
- Roby.

1111
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,547
- How do you remember it?

1112
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:44,581
- 'Cause...
- Magic.

1113
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,318
- Here. Grab one.
- Oh, do it. Okay.

1114
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,486
- I'll keep going.
- Got it.

1115
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,854
- Look at it, both of you.

1116
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,122
- Ooh.

1117
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:53,491
- Good, good, good.
Say "stop" at any moment.

1118
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:54,559
- Stop.

1119
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,066
- Put your card down
right over here.

1120
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,465
So I just rub down the pants,
and I get a bit of color

1121
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,734
from the pants...

1122
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,435
into the pack, like so.

1123
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:05,970
- Oh, God.
- Oh, yes.

1124
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:07,348
Now, that color could
have gone anywhere.

1125
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:08,812
It went to that seven
of hearts, yes?

1126
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,942
Oh!

1127
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,977
- The magician.
He pulled a Houdini.

1128
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:14,479
- I feel like, honestly, like,

1129
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,523
yeah, you can give them, like,
tricks and stuff like that,

1130
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,707
but at the end of the day,
how long is that gonna work?

1131
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,060
- I don't want it to be
the Roby Show.

1132
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,753
I want it to be the Rachel...

1133
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,139
This is the Rachel
and Gabby Show.

1134
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,799
How is it like being
on the other side

1135
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,292
of the table right now?

1136
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,760
- It's refreshing.
- Yeah?

1137
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:30,061
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

1138
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:31,848
- It's like you're in
the position of power.

1139
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,574
You have the authority.
You have the control.

1140
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,600
You know, you can say
that "no."

1141
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:36,968
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

1142
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,336
How are you feeling?

1143
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:39,904
- I'm so nervous.
It's frenetic.

1144
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,105
- That's normal.
- Yeah.

1145
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,212
- We've been there.
- Yeah?

1146
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,608
- Yeah.
- Definitely normal.

1147
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:45,743
- What was the scariest
moment for you?

1148
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,612
- Um, all of it.

1149
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,714
- All of it?
- I mean...

1150
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,261
- Where are they?
I want to find them.

1151
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,217
That's what I'm saying.
- Yeah, we have to.

1152
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,186
- She's still over there?
- No.

1153
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,630
- Are you gonna sneak in there
and steal some time?

1154
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:57,789
- You've got to be sneaky.

1155
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,300
Just a little bit.
- But do you want to step

1156
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:01,426
on people's toes?
I don't know, 'cause...

1157
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:02,694
- Not on your toes, for sure.

1158
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,196
You're at the most...
You're most vulnerable!

1159
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:07,598
- Might have to be aggressive
to really get that time

1160
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:11,869
and actually make a...
I guess, like, an impression.

1161
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,671
- Double the trouble.

1162
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,173
We love it.

1163
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,650
- We wanted to meet
you guys together

1164
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:17,976
'cause, obviously, we're twins,

1165
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,002
but we want you to see
the differences between us,

1166
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,455
'cause our personalities,
I feel like,

1167
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,880
we're very different.

1168
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,091
For me, for instance,
I feel like

1169
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,426
I'm a little bit more
of a laid-back,

1170
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,290
reserved kind of person,
a little bit outgoing.

1171
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:28,786
He's more of a bold,

1172
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,355
out-there type person.
- Bold...

1173
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:31,489
Okay.
- Yeah.

1174
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:33,157
- So that's how we kind
of differentiate

1175
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:34,726
between each other
and who we attract,

1176
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,537
who we don't attract, like,
so that's how we...

1177
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:37,729
yeah.
- Okay.

1178
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:38,930
- Yeah, so, definitely.

1179
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,165
- How does it feel
coming in together?

1180
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,134
- You guys definitely
make us feel calm, though.

1181
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,081
I could tell that energy,
that... yeah, exactly.

1182
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,405
- You bring
such positive energy.

1183
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:48,749
- So you guys...
- That's so nice.

1184
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:51,542
- Yeah, yeah.
You're... so, okay.

1185
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,344
You guys said you have
your differences.

1186
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:54,812
- Yes.
- So what is

1187
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,614
the differences
besides personality-wise?

1188
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,049
Hobbies?

1189
00:41:58,116 --> 00:41:59,956
- No... honestly, not a lot.
- Or same hobbies?

1190
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,519
- Everything.
- So we're all the same?

1191
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,688
- Yeah.
- Went to the same school.

1192
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,823
- Oh, so you guys
never separate?

1193
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,326
- Well, we didn't live together
all throughout school.

1194
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:09,770
We did, like, a couple
of years and then we, like,

1195
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:10,838
separated 'cause we wanted to do

1196
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:11,972
our own thing and be individual.

1197
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,898
- Absolutely.
- We had to, you know.

1198
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,309
- Yeah. Kind of...
- Like job-wise,

1199
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,610
we do the same job.
- Yeah, what's job?

1200
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,870
So we're... medical
advertising's what we do,

1201
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,972
but both
separate companies, though.

1202
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,107
So, like,
that's the only difference.

1203
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:24,675
<i>- The conversations
with the twins</i>

1204
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:25,977
and Rachel and I

1205
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,578
is... just ain't working for me,

1206
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,547
kind of, romantically.

1207
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:32,850
I feel like I can't,
like, build a very strong bond

1208
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,685
<i>with either of the twins.</i>

1209
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,523
Yeah, it's just, like...

1210
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,391
I don't know.

1211
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,927
It ain't doing it for me.

1212
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:45,229
Do you feel like you guys
can read each other's minds?

1213
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,731
- Like, across campus
in college,

1214
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,499
I could spot him
from miles away.

1215
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,334
- Oh, wow.
- Stuff like that.

1216
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,412
Do you guys experience
any of that,

1217
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:52,603
you know, being together?

1218
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,230
- We weren't
in the womb together, so...

1219
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:56,607
I think it's much different.

1220
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:57,751
- We can read
each other's minds.

1221
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,277
- Yeah.
- Never know.

1222
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,013
- There's me, there's Gabby,
there's both the twins.

1223
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,791
<i>I don't know if they're
trying to get us to go</i>

1224
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:05,917
<i>on double dates,
planning for the future,</i>

1225
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:08,553
<i>but definitely hard
to form a connection</i>

1226
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,755
<i>when there's multiple people
sitting here.</i>

1227
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,523
I'm not into it.

1228
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,034
- The one thing I want
to get across is,

1229
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,169
I'm here for something real.

1230
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:16,327
- Okay, me too. Awesome.

1231
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:18,563
- And I want to be here.
I want to be super open.

1232
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,499
And whenever I found out both
of you were the Bachelorettes...

1233
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:22,643
- Yeah, what were
your thoughts on that?

1234
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:23,601
Were you nervous?
- It was a little scary.

1235
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:24,602
Exactly.
I was a little nervous.

1236
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:25,803
Like, I came into this,

1237
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,271
I kind of showed you guys...

1238
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:28,482
I wanted to, like,
separate you two.

1239
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:30,808
That's how I did
the earphone thing.

1240
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,844
- And we definitely
noticed that as well.

1241
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,121
- So I wanted to,
like, show you that,

1242
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:35,780
like, I had
the Florida vibe with you.

1243
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:37,724
And then I didn't want you
to hear what I said to her.

1244
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,617
I heard.

1245
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:42,587
But no, I appreciate that,
because it really does mean

1246
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:45,890
a lot for, you know, someone
to come in and give us both,

1247
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,126
individually, like,
our own attention.

1248
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,527
- You two are very different.

1249
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:51,605
But I understand, you're, like,
on the same journey,

1250
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,631
but you have
your own separate journeys.

1251
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:54,908
So, like,
I wanted to come in and be

1252
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:57,034
able to show you
that, like, I recognize you,

1253
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,636
I recognize her
in different ways.

1254
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:00,505
- Yeah.
- And, like, that's

1255
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:01,782
kind of how I came up
with what I did.

1256
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,541
- It's perfect.
- Yeah.

1257
00:44:03,608 --> 00:44:05,085
<i>- Tonight, at the beginning,
it was a little awkward</i>

1258
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,545
<i>just because me and Gabby really</i>

1259
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:09,780
<i>don't want it
to be a competition.</i>

1260
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,350
Of course, Gabby and I are
in this journey together,

1261
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:15,987
but little moments like that
where the men are able

1262
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:19,657
to make me feel like
I'm the only girl there,

1263
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:22,260
it's important, I think,
for Gabby and I

1264
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,528
both to feel different.

1265
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,329
- All right,
so if I'm gonna ever

1266
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,564
bring you home, to Boston,

1267
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:28,065
to meet my friends and family,

1268
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:29,610
you're gonna stick out
like a sore thumb.

1269
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:31,169
- Oh, why? Okay.
- Unless...

1270
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:32,703
unless we teach you the lingo.

1271
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,372
- Oh, God.
- I know you know English,

1272
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:35,706
but this is different.

1273
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,508
- Barely.
- All right.

1274
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:38,752
So I'm gonna be a teacher.
- Oh!

1275
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,778
How did I miss that whiteboard?

1276
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:41,922
- If you're walking
down the street

1277
00:44:41,946 --> 00:44:43,123
and you want to say "hi"
to someone...

1278
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,649
- Uh-huh.

1279
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,317
You write like a five-year-old.

1280
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:49,187
No, that's pretty good.
"Hello, good"?

1281
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:50,454
- Will you chill?

1282
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,689
Can you let me finish?

1283
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:56,093
- "Hello, good sir. How..."

1284
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,962
- You don't say "good sir."

1285
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,307
- So we're being very proper.
- Is Boston in like, the 1800s?

1286
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:01,441
- If you wanted to say this,
super proper...

1287
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:02,576
- People say that
with a straight face?

1288
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,435
- Gabby, Gabby, zhh, zhh.
- No, they don't.

1289
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:06,304
Okay, okay.
- Gabber, Gabber.

1290
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,905
Look at me. Look at me. Shh.

1291
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:09,073
- Okay, I'm done.

1292
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,384
- We're gonna say it
in Boston...

1293
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:12,710
- Uh-huh.
- This is what we do.

1294
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,378
<i>- Ryan is really fun.
I feel like</i>

1295
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,315
<i>we have great energy
right off the bat.</i>

1296
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,659
Hey, guy, how are you?

1297
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:20,585
I could do that.
- Beautiful.

1298
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,386
<i>- He's super easy to talk to.</i>

1299
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,464
We can just kind of, like, give
each other a little

1300
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,958
and just, like, overall,
enjoy his company.

1301
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,292
Do I have a booger?

1302
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:29,827
- No. Do you? No.

1303
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,138
You have something...

1304
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:32,597
- No, do I have one?

1305
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:33,764
- Oh, my...
- No, stop!

1306
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,299
- Gab, Gab, you gotta go.
- Do I?

1307
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:36,643
- Cut, cut...
No, I'm just kidding.

1308
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,478
You don't have anything.
You have nothing. Nothing.

1309
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:40,638
- Knowing that Ryan
is already so invested

1310
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:41,973
is such a good feeling.

1311
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,199
- I was so pumped to meet you

1312
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,551
because you're
absolutely hysterical.

1313
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,244
- Oh, my gosh, thank you.

1314
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:49,547
<i>- I can't wait to see what
the rest of the night brings.</i>

1315
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:56,187
<i>- I can't pick who I like more.</i>

1316
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:57,555
You know, I'm really excited

1317
00:45:57,622 --> 00:45:59,102
to just get one-on-one time
with both,

1318
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:01,025
get a fair shot with both,
and just see

1319
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,236
who I have
a better connection with.

1320
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,628
I think that's important.

1321
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,539
- They both have different
qualities that are amazing,

1322
00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:07,832
so it is possible that you could

1323
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,433
fall for both
and not even know it

1324
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,178
until you, like, wake up
one day, and like,

1325
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:13,013
"Man, what do I choose?"
- Especially there's two.

1326
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:15,072
- What do I choose?
- Yeah.

1327
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:16,240
- Oof!

1328
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:17,467
- We'll warm you up out here.

1329
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,410
- Yeah, we need a blanket
or something.

1330
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,712
The night started off
a little bit awkward,

1331
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,615
but since we've
been able to separate,

1332
00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:27,385
<i>getting to talk to these guys
individually is almost</i>

1333
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,854
<i>like meeting them again
for the first time.</i>

1334
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,921
- I went to UCF.

1335
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,089
- No way.

1336
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,333
- And so I live in Tampa now,
though.

1337
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:34,859
- My brother lives in Tampa.

1338
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,094
I am really hopeful
that I'm gonna start

1339
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,130
making more romantic connections

1340
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,799
with these guys,
because that's why I'm here

1341
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:43,234
and that's what I'm looking for.

1342
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,102
- I know that
a couple of weeks ago,

1343
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,169
it was your birthday.

1344
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,272
- It was!
- Okay.

1345
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:49,940
So I had plenty
of time to do this.

1346
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,509
- Oh, my goodness.

1347
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,146
Oh, my...

1348
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,048
- I had plenty of time.
- Can I read it?

1349
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,949
- Yes, I would love for you
to read it.

1350
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,785
- "Happy birthday, Rachel.

1351
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,621
"I know your birthday
was a few weeks ago,

1352
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:06,324
"but it's never too late
for best wishes.

1353
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,626
"I hope your life is filled
with an abundance

1354
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:12,797
"of love, joy,
and most of all, me.

1355
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:15,533
Love, your co-pilot, Hayden."

1356
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,935
Oh, my gosh, I love it.

1357
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,804
This is so special.

1358
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,673
Oh, my goodness.
- Well, that came from heart.

1359
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,176
<i>- Hayden is so cute.</i>

1360
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,446
He really went out of his way
to let me know

1361
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,815
that he's interested
in being here for me,

1362
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:34,085
<i>and that makes me
feel so special.</i>

1363
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:37,021
<i>I definitely feel
a spark with Hayden.</i>

1364
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:38,665
- I've had this
for a long time, basically.

1365
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,191
It's just a list
of, like, attributes

1366
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,759
that... about a future wife.
- Aww.

1367
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,203
- I'm not sure
if you have one of these.

1368
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:45,596
It's kind of cringy,
but then I'm like, all right.

1369
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,965
- No, that's okay.
No, I appreciate the effort.

1370
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,743
I feel like it's important
to think about these things,

1371
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:52,012
for sure, especially going into
something like this where...

1372
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,180
- Oh, my gosh.
- You know, you don't really

1373
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,314
know what you're going into.

1374
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:55,816
- Well, I don't know,
at the same time,

1375
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,475
like, are we gonna be good
together?

1376
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,776
- Totally.
- Is there things

1377
00:47:58,843 --> 00:48:01,846
that are going to, you know,
branch out for us?

1378
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,414
Like,
this is not just a first date.

1379
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:05,850
It's, like, almost like
a first everything.

1380
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,185
So I'll kind of go over these.
- Right, right.

1381
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:11,021
- So the first attribute
of a future partner is,

1382
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,424
is open and honest
with her feelings.

1383
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:16,560
They are intentional
in everything that they do.

1384
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,662
Takes care
of herself physically.

1385
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,498
So hopefully you take care...

1386
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,166
I mean...

1387
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:25,469
<i>- Shirtless Jacob,
his pecs are rock-hard.</i>

1388
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:27,671
- Lives a very passionate life.

1389
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,440
- I can't stop looking at 'em.

1390
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,610
- Yeah, and then has
a good sense of humor.

1391
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:35,112
So obviously, I think
we're good on that part, maybe.

1392
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:36,414
- Yeah.

1393
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,415
He's great.

1394
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:40,918
He came to our conversation

1395
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:42,753
very intentional,

1396
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,756
<i>which is nice, but he was
way more shy than I thought.</i>

1397
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,223
I thought they were
gonna be kissing

1398
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,326
all over the place,
but they haven't.

1399
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:52,530
- I guess, isn't afraid
of physical touch.

1400
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,596
- Yeah.
- So, I mean...

1401
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,568
- I'm terrified. No.

1402
00:48:57,635 --> 00:48:59,470
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
- Yeah.

1403
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:01,505
<i>I think physical chemistry means</i>

1404
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:03,092
<i>so much,
especially when you're dating,</i>

1405
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,276
<i>in order to, like,
keep the attraction.</i>

1406
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,978
<i>So I feel like kissing
is really important.</i>

1407
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:10,047
- Like, you think
anyone's kissed them yet?

1408
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,459
I'd kiss both of them, but I
don't know how that would work.

1409
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:14,718
- Yeah.
- Before I kiss one of them,

1410
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,554
I gotta figure out
which one I like.

1411
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,398
'cause I'm not gonna play.
I'm not gonna play with them.

1412
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,624
- It's a delicate process
where you can't

1413
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,335
come on too strong,
but you have to be a little bit

1414
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,029
selfish and just be you
to figure out, like,

1415
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:26,864
is there that instant chemistry?

1416
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:28,341
- You know, one thing
I definitely wanted

1417
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,868
to let you know up front is,
you know what you said

1418
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:34,038
inside about kinda opening up
and vulnerability?

1419
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,239
- It's very important to me.

1420
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:36,683
- It's very important,
yeah, I know.

1421
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,476
But it's like,
it's always been kind of tough

1422
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:41,045
for me to do that early on.
- Okay.

1423
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,447
- But I want you to know that,
you know, I'm here for you.

1424
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:44,882
- Yeah.
- And I'm willing

1425
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:46,283
to kind of meet you there.

1426
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:47,785
And it might
take me a little bit

1427
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:48,895
longer than some
of the other people...

1428
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,354
- We'll work on it.
- We'll try.

1429
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:52,456
But, you know,
I'm gonna give it my absolute,

1430
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:54,525
100% best when it comes to that.

1431
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:58,028
<i>- I really liked Aven
right off the bat.</i>

1432
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,997
Kind of wearing your heart
on your sleeve,

1433
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:02,132
even when it's scary.
- I know.

1434
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:06,270
<i>- He definitely was inching
a little bit closer to me...</i>

1435
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,572
- I'm just... I'm like,
oh, my gosh,

1436
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:10,474
I really, really hope
this experience is

1437
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,843
so much better
for the both of you.

1438
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,178
- Yeah.

1439
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:15,365
- That must have been a lot.

1440
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:19,083
<i>- But there was no kiss.</i>

1441
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,818
- It was so great
to talk to you.

1442
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:22,720
- Maybe it just wasn't
the right moment.

1443
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:24,221
Maybe he was nervous.

1444
00:50:24,288 --> 00:50:26,991
<i>I'm not sure
what's going on with him,</i>

1445
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,359
but I, at least for me,

1446
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,827
thought it was
a good conversation.

1447
00:50:29,894 --> 00:50:31,695
- So I understand
that you're a pilot.

1448
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:34,231
- I am.
- Right, and that's super cool.

1449
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:36,133
So me being a race car driver,

1450
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,236
I might have brought
my actual race car.

1451
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:40,738
- Oh, my goodness!
- To show you.

1452
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,006
- Whoa!

1453
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,316
- This is what's called
a Top Fuel dragster.

1454
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,642
- Oh, my goodness.

1455
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,410
- So this is the car
that I drive.

1456
00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:48,512
- So you sit...
- Right in here.

1457
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:49,880
- Oh, my God.

1458
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,417
- So that's where I sit.
- Whoa!

1459
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:54,828
- Here's my controls
in here, so...

1460
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:55,853
- Okay.

1461
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,130
- So these two levers right here

1462
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:59,123
are the parachutes, so I go...

1463
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:00,824
- Wait, so you go,
like, really fast

1464
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,726
and then the parachutes
go out the back?

1465
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:05,095
- I've gone 330 miles an hour.
- Are you serious?

1466
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:06,797
- This thing goes
330 miles an hour.

1467
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:07,865
- Oh, my goodness.

1468
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:09,466
- It's pretty big, though,
isn't it?

1469
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,136
With you being a pilot and all,
you know, you spent hours

1470
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,638
and hours learning
how to fly a plane, you know,

1471
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:16,049
learning the controls,
all that sort of thing.

1472
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,142
So, you know,
I kind of did the same thing.

1473
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,344
And so when you drive
one of these things,

1474
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,246
you have to learn
what the controls are,

1475
00:51:22,313 --> 00:51:23,447
all those kind of things.

1476
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:25,015
So hopefully one day,
you can show me

1477
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,217
how to fly a plane,
and one day I can

1478
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,295
show you how to drive
this thing.

1479
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,820
- Absolutely!

1480
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:32,590
<i>- Jordan V.
Really surprised me.</i>

1481
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:36,560
I enjoyed our conversation,
and I feel like,

1482
00:51:36,627 --> 00:51:39,396
in a way,
we do have a lot in common.

1483
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,765
Wow, I'm very impressed by you.

1484
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:43,867
- I'm impressed by you.

1485
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,436
- Oh, thank you.

1486
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:46,670
- I came here for you, so...

1487
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,672
- Oh, for me? Really?

1488
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:49,773
- Yes.

1489
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,119
I don't know if you're
familiar with horsepower,

1490
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:55,112
but it makes
11,000 horsepower, so...

1491
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:58,215
- Oh, my goodness. Wow.

1492
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:02,252
<i>I was a little bit surprised
that Jordan didn't kiss me.</i>

1493
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,788
<i>I thought the moment was right,</i>

1494
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,156
<i>but, I mean,</i>

1495
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:08,592
it is only night one, but...

1496
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:11,929
Clayton kissed me on night one.

1497
00:52:11,996 --> 00:52:13,206
- I noticed
when you guys were in there,

1498
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,841
one of the things you said,
you were like,

1499
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:17,534
just to kind of be
more open and honest

1500
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,737
right now,
like, to be vulnerable.

1501
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,247
And that's, like,
a part of the journey.

1502
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,641
And then you guys were like,
"Cheers up to that!" right?

1503
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:25,676
And I was like "Oh, okay."
- Yeah. Do it now!

1504
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:27,821
- But, like, what does that,
like, look like for you?

1505
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:29,856
Considering, you know,
Clayton was like, "I love you."

1506
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,458
- Right, right.
- And then you fell through.

1507
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,917
How has your lens
changed in that area?

1508
00:52:34,018 --> 00:52:36,887
- For me, it took me...
I definitely got there,

1509
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:38,489
but it took me
a little bit of time

1510
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:41,325
to be more vulnerable

1511
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:43,394
and kind of share my story

1512
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,396
and have faith in myself

1513
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,398
and the relationship
that I was building.

1514
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:48,866
- Yeah.
- I think it's so important

1515
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,200
to just, like, trust your gut

1516
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,269
and know what you have to offer.

1517
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,446
- Absolutely.
I just want you to know

1518
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:54,848
I'm coming to you
with a open heart.

1519
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:56,573
I think, naturally,
as, like, a man,

1520
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,184
you know, I think
in our culture today, like,

1521
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,911
there's this stigma that,
like, men are just closed off,

1522
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:02,780
like, you know,
they have walls up,

1523
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,381
but I'm willing
to be vulnerable...

1524
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:05,616
- Yeah.
- And to just be

1525
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,127
present-minded with you,
you know what I'm saying?

1526
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:08,328
- Totally.
And that's a good sentiment.

1527
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,462
- Just not, like,
going through the motions.

1528
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:10,697
You know what I'm saying, right?

1529
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:12,032
It's like, "All right,
hey, you take care."

1530
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:13,057
You know what I'm saying?

1531
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,625
- You just hit my reflex
in my knee.

1532
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,427
- Wow, did, like, your leg
just kick off?

1533
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,696
Also, I'm a doctor.

1534
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,698
But no, I'm just saying, like,

1535
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:23,067
I do look
for that connecting point.

1536
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:24,902
- Yeah, I appreciate that.

1537
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:26,170
- No problem.
- Yeah.

1538
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:28,806
- Yeah, but you look
very beautiful, though.

1539
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,841
- Oh, thank you.
You as well.

1540
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:32,676
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1541
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:46,890
- I was just...

1542
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:50,094
- You know, I'm glad you did.
- Okay.

1543
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,030
I was like, I just
really want to kiss you, so...

1544
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:55,799
- Yeah. Aww, I appreciate that.

1545
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:58,535
- Yeah, no, but I look forward
to connecting more with you...

1546
00:53:58,602 --> 00:53:59,536
- I know. Me too.

1547
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:01,772
- Over the course
of several weeks.

1548
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:05,175
- Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

1549
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,344
<i>I was really excited
to talk to Mario.</i>

1550
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,912
<i>He's a great kisser.</i>

1551
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,714
<i>He's kind of giving me
butterflies.</i>

1552
00:54:12,316 --> 00:54:14,785
<i>These first few guys
are really amazing.</i>

1553
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:17,855
<i>It's truly surreal to know
that they're here for me.</i>

1554
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,623
<i>I'm enjoying the hell out of it.</i>

1555
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,559
But I want to know
who Rachel is kissing,

1556
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,661
if they're good, if they're bad.

1557
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:26,396
I feel like it's not weird.

1558
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,498
I mean, she's my friend.

1559
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:28,866
- We're gonna sit right here.

1560
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:33,871
Yeah, so I figured, you know,
you might have a little bit

1561
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,873
of a troubled past
with the stairs.

1562
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,908
So maybe we could...
- No!

1563
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:39,309
- Maybe we could get together

1564
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,778
and make a better memory
out of it.

1565
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:42,246
- Not the stairs.

1566
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:44,181
- Ah, you know,
we could tackle it and,

1567
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:46,950
you know, maybe you'll remember
the stairs really fondly now.

1568
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,819
<i>- I'm really excited about Tino.</i>

1569
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:51,255
<i>He brings me to the stairs,</i>

1570
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:52,990
which... I had a little bit

1571
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:57,227
of a time on the stairs
on my season with Clayton.

1572
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,296
And he tells me he wants
to make the stairs,

1573
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:01,265
<i>you know, a little bit better.</i>

1574
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,934
<i>So I am really curious
to see what he has for me.</i>

1575
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,937
- I mean, it's incredible
that you went on that

1576
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:09,640
journey you did, and now you're
back, like, running it back.

1577
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:11,508
- I know. It's...
- I think that's incredible.

1578
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:12,743
- Crazy to be here.

1579
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,778
How do you feel?
Are you nervous?

1580
00:55:14,845 --> 00:55:17,681
- Yeah, I mean, I totally was,
you know, like, driving up.

1581
00:55:17,748 --> 00:55:20,117
I actually did feel a little
bit more at home on that,

1582
00:55:20,184 --> 00:55:22,820
because I'm
a general contractor, so...

1583
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:24,621
- Okay.
- Yeah, so like, I mean,

1584
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:26,490
that actually did feel
pretty comfortable.

1585
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:29,426
I was like, "All right, cool,
this is kinda, like, normal..."

1586
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:30,427
- Every day,
you're on the forklift?

1587
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:31,795
- No, no.

1588
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:34,264
Like, I get excited
every time I get to go on it.

1589
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,899
It's that rare.

1590
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,377
- You needed the helmet.
- So getting to do it

1591
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:38,769
in this situation,
yeah, I mean...

1592
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,471
- I mean, there's some
creative entrances.

1593
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:43,216
Yours was one of my favorite.
I really liked it.

1594
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,508
- Really?
- Yeah.

1595
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:46,810
I appreciate the driving skills.

1596
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:50,514
- Well, I came
to make you laugh,

1597
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:52,416
so I'm glad I can.
- Well, it's perfect.

1598
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,751
You're off to a great start.
You took me to the stairs.

1599
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:58,121
- Would you let me kiss you?

1600
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:00,400
- Yes.
- We can go on the cheek

1601
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:01,758
if you want.

1602
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:15,114
- The stairs are
already getting better.

1603
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,506
- Yeah, I was just gonna say,

1604
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:19,009
you better smile
when you see stairs now.

1605
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:20,978
'Cause I know I'm going to.

1606
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,079
- Already better.

1607
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,081
Can we just stay
on these stairs then?

1608
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:27,484
<i>I'm so happy to finally
get a kiss tonight.</i>

1609
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:30,387
Tino is definitely
the romantic connection

1610
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:31,822
that I've been hoping to have,

1611
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,191
and it's what
I've been waiting for.

1612
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:42,032
<i>I feel better than ever about
finding my future partner.</i>

1613
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:44,668
<i>I can't wait to see how
the rest of the night goes.</i>

1614
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:51,008
<i>- What a night.</i>

1615
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,309
<i>- I know.</i>

1616
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:53,577
<i>How's it going?</i>

1617
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:55,445
- Oh, my god, it was so good.

1618
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:56,823
- Do you think they're watching
right now?

1619
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:58,115
- Yeah.

1620
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:59,225
- How many people
have you talked to you?

1621
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,493
Okay, tell me, tell me, tell me.

1622
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:02,219
- Mario, I really like.

1623
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:03,796
I feel like we had
a really good conversation.

1624
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,656
He was, like, so nervous.
It was cute.

1625
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:06,790
- Oh, my gosh!

1626
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:08,258
- And I talked to...
- Jacob.

1627
00:57:08,325 --> 00:57:09,526
- Yeah.
- How was that?

1628
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:10,861
- We were laying on a fur rug

1629
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:13,664
by the fireplace
with him shirtless.

1630
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,100
- How about you?
- I talked to Hayden

1631
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,603
and he made me a birthday card.
- Oh, my God.

1632
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,080
- Because my birthday was
two weeks ago.

1633
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,839
It was so sweet.
- Oh, that's so sweet.

1634
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:24,684
- And then I talked to Jordan,
the race car driver.

1635
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:25,842
- Okay.
- He surprised me.

1636
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:26,944
- Oh, good.

1637
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:30,113
- Yeah.
And then I talked to Tino.

1638
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,180
- How was that?

1639
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:32,482
We kissed.

1640
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,453
- Have you kissed anyone?
- I kissed Mario.

1641
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:40,357
- They're all so different.

1642
00:57:40,424 --> 00:57:41,725
- I know. It's so true.

1643
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,560
- And you, like,
are attracted to different

1644
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,195
qualities in each person.

1645
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:48,432
- It's, like, different
being with them

1646
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:50,267
separately than it was
when they were, like,

1647
00:57:50,334 --> 00:57:52,002
introducing themselves
to us both.

1648
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:53,303
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1649
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:54,972
- Now I kind of understand
how you can

1650
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:56,807
have feelings
for multiple people.

1651
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:59,476
- Are you saying you're falling
in love with three women?

1652
00:57:59,543 --> 00:58:00,877
- I'm in love with everybody!

1653
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:03,046
- "I'm in love,
and it feels so good."

1654
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:04,281
- Yeah.

1655
00:58:04,348 --> 00:58:06,016
<i>I think tonight
is going really well.</i>

1656
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:09,019
<i>These guys have already made
such good impressions,</i>

1657
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:11,254
so I'm really excited
to see how the rest

1658
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,957
of tonight goes
and see what happens.

1659
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:18,762
- My man, my man!

1660
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:20,497
- Gentlemen.
How are we doing?

1661
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:21,865
How are we doing?

1662
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:23,934
A little something
for Gabby and Rachel.

1663
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:25,979
I'll put it right there.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

1664
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,003
See you guys.
- All right.

1665
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:28,438
My man Jesse.

1666
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,507
- Oh, there's two. Yay.
- There's two.

1667
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:32,642
- Two is better than one,
you know?

1668
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:34,444
- Makes it a little more real.

1669
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,846
- Makes it a lot more real.

1670
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,715
That thing's staring me
right in the face, you know?

1671
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:40,526
<i>- I think hearts kind of drop
a little bit, you know,</i>

1672
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,386
<i>go into the stomach.
I know for me it did.</i>

1673
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:44,254
If you don't make an impression,

1674
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:46,323
you know, those two roses
or any rose

1675
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:49,026
<i>might not be yours and you
might be going home, so,</i>

1676
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,328
<i>you know, I think it made it
all real for everybody.</i>

1677
00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:53,964
- The clock is ticking.
- So many guys.

1678
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,775
- You have to be a little
cocky in this situation.

1679
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:57,076
You have to kind
of get yourself out there.

1680
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,535
- Gotta get in there.
- Yeah.

1681
00:58:58,602 --> 00:59:00,570
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1682
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:03,106
- Should we have our
whole conversation like this?

1683
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:05,075
- It would make it
a lot easier for me.

1684
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:07,711
I'd be a lot less nervous
if we did.

1685
00:59:07,778 --> 00:59:08,855
I'm going for it.
I'm going for Gabby.

1686
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,080
You know what I'm saying?

1687
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:12,416
- I'm gonna try
to talk to Rachel right now.

1688
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,051
- Putting your flag in early.

1689
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:16,486
- I think the First Impression
Rose is everything.

1690
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,088
<i>I think that
would really set the tone</i>

1691
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:20,057
for the rest of our journey.

1692
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:22,259
I'm nervous.
My heart... you gotta feel.

1693
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:23,994
It is pounding out of my chest.

1694
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,071
- You should have more to drink.

1695
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:26,396
Yeah, I should.

1696
00:59:26,463 --> 00:59:27,664
- Obviously, at some point,

1697
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:28,908
they're gonna end up
liking the same person.

1698
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:30,009
- It's gonna happen.
With 30 guys?

1699
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,635
- And then
how is that gonna work?

1700
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,246
It could be awkward.
They could get in a fight.

1701
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,371
You never know.

1702
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:36,006
Like, it's interesting
to think about.

1703
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,717
- Pressure is mounting
a little bit just to get

1704
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,152
that conversation,
I'm not gonna lie.

1705
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:41,278
- I would love
the First Impression Rose.

1706
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,580
<i>I am gonna try and get time
with Gabby and Rachel.</i>

1707
00:59:43,647 --> 00:59:46,683
I think I would rather talk
to the real chicks

1708
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:50,454
rather than continue
to talk to these two.

1709
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,422
The bird just pooped in my hand.

1710
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:55,025
So I wanted to get
something out of the way.

1711
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,159
- Okay.

1712
00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:57,994
I'm dying to know
your biggest fear.

1713
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:59,763
- My biggest fear?
- Your biggest fear.

1714
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:00,931
Okay, on three, ready?

1715
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:02,208
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna say mine too.

1716
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:04,234
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

1717
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:05,368
- Clowns.
- Sharks.

1718
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,736
Clowns?
- Sharks?

1719
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:08,147
- Okay,
I've heard there was, like,

1720
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:11,241
a couple clowns, like,
during the entrances today.

1721
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:13,410
So were you just terrified
out of your mind?

1722
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:16,012
- Wait, you're smooth.
That was a good one.

1723
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,582
<i>I am very attracted to Logan.</i>

1724
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,584
<i>He made me laugh.</i>

1725
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:23,286
I think
we're both very spontaneous.

1726
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,255
This is my first time
really out in California.

1727
01:00:25,322 --> 01:00:26,990
- Yeah.
But I've always kind of wanted

1728
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:29,459
to see the Pacific Northwest,
as well, Washington...

1729
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:31,094
- Seattle.
- Yeah.

1730
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:32,472
- You busy in the next
couple weeks?

1731
01:00:32,496 --> 01:00:33,773
- I don't know.
- You think we can make time?

1732
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,165
- Maybe.

1733
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:37,243
- I think maybe we could, like,
figure something out.

1734
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:39,836
<i>I was really happy
the way it went with Rachel.</i>

1735
01:00:39,903 --> 01:00:41,605
It felt like we had
a real connection.

1736
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:44,207
<i>But navigating
two Bachelorettes,</i>

1737
01:00:44,274 --> 01:00:46,443
<i>this is a really
difficult process.</i>

1738
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:48,745
- I'll see you inside.
- Absolutely.

1739
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:51,014
<i>I need more to go off of
before I can make</i>

1740
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:52,883
a decision
on who I want to pursue.

1741
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,352
- Did you speak with both?
- No, gosh.

1742
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:57,130
If I spoke with both,
that'd be pretty impressive.

1743
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,855
I don't think anybody has.

1744
01:00:58,922 --> 01:01:01,658
- How are you tonight?
- I'm good. How are you?

1745
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:02,726
- I'm doing so well.

1746
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:03,960
- Where are your chicks?

1747
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:05,667
- The chicks.
- Did you ditch them for me?

1748
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:07,140
- They had
a little too much to drink.

1749
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,166
I had to call them a cab home.

1750
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:12,102
I still have a lot
to, like, learn about you.

1751
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,770
- Yeah.
- But you seem so fun.

1752
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,105
- Oh, thank you.

1753
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,340
- Like, when Shanae got
kicked out of the house

1754
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:19,509
and you just
double bottled up...

1755
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:21,778
- Yeah!
- I'm like...

1756
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,747
- That's my hidden talent.
- Yeah.

1757
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:27,484
Okay, so are you the type
of person who goes into a movie

1758
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:29,786
and buys candy
at the concessions stand?

1759
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:30,987
- Oh.

1760
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,331
- Or do you bring,
like, a trench coat...

1761
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,524
- Right.
- And, like, stuff everything

1762
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,693
in the pockets
and kind of sneak in?

1763
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,762
- Yeah, the trench coat.
- The trench coat?

1764
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:40,997
- Like, a whole sandwich.
- God, I'm so relieved.

1765
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:42,732
- Yeah.
<i>Logan's great.</i>

1766
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,434
<i>He's super endearing.</i>

1767
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:46,570
<i>I feel like we have
similar senses of humor.</i>

1768
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,271
- I'll put corn dogs in there.

1769
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:49,906
- Yeah.
- Like, burritos.

1770
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:52,542
- Full... totally.
Like, hot dinner food.

1771
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:55,445
I am excited
to see where things go.

1772
01:01:55,512 --> 01:01:57,948
We did have so much fun
and he's somebody

1773
01:01:58,014 --> 01:01:59,883
that I have my eye on
for the future.

1774
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,484
- What are you
looking forward to most?

1775
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,987
- I'm looking forward
for it to be over...

1776
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:05,956
No, just kidding.

1777
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:08,358
What do you think, guys?

1778
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:11,761
Gabby, Rachel, any preference?

1779
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,196
Yeah, I don't know.

1780
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:14,740
- You look beautiful tonight,
by the way.

1781
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:17,834
- Oh, thank you.
So do you. Beautiful.

1782
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,169
- Even with this tie?

1783
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:20,570
- Not that, but...
- Okay.

1784
01:02:20,637 --> 01:02:22,114
What do you think
about the mullet, by the way?

1785
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:24,074
- But it was...
Oh, I love a mullet.

1786
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,251
- You do? I was concerned.
- Uh-huh.

1787
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:26,485
One of my best friends
has a mullet.

1788
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:27,677
She's a girl.

1789
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,547
Okay, that's...

1790
01:02:30,614 --> 01:02:32,315
- No, it looks good.
- Thank you.

1791
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,651
- Yeah, and you have,
like, a good natural curl.

1792
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:36,462
- Wow, this is just so nice.
Thank you so much.

1793
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,154
- Yeah, I'm not this nice
all the time,

1794
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:40,190
so don't get used to it.

1795
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,858
Honestly,
I'm quickly thinking of a way

1796
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:44,828
to insult you, but it's not
coming fast enough.

1797
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:49,308
- Okay, well, I will
give you a compliment.

1798
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,501
- Oh, yeah, I'm here for that.

1799
01:02:51,568 --> 01:02:53,603
- You look absolutely stunning.

1800
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:54,904
- Thank you.

1801
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:57,607
I have fake hair, a fake tan.

1802
01:02:57,674 --> 01:02:58,884
- Do you really?
- No, I'm just kidding.

1803
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:00,086
Yeah, just a little bit
but you can't tell

1804
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,411
'cause boys are dumb.
- I know.

1805
01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:02,755
You could have fooled me easily.

1806
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,281
- Yeah, it's just a little bit.

1807
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:06,616
Just a little volume
in the back, you know?

1808
01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:08,427
- The mullet's not real,
to be honest with you.

1809
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,153
It's also fake.

1810
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,622
- Those are also extensions.
- These are extensions.

1811
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:13,823
- You can feel it up here.

1812
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,225
They just, like, clip in.

1813
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:16,326
Ah! No, I'm just kidding.

1814
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:19,496
Stop!

1815
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:22,232
I don't know you enough
to trust that.

1816
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,600
<i>- I really like Erich.</i>

1817
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:25,101
It's just so easy with us.

1818
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:26,646
I feel like we were
making each other laugh.

1819
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,672
I could really
be myself around him.

1820
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,308
I honestly hate
groomed chest hair.

1821
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,119
- You know what?
I shaved my chest hair once.

1822
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,277
- Oh, yeah?

1823
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:35,488
- Will never do that again
in my life.

1824
01:03:35,512 --> 01:03:37,113
- Yeah.
- It's the worst.

1825
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,224
Have you ever shaved
your chest hair?

1826
01:03:38,248 --> 01:03:39,749
All the time.

1827
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,016
Let me see? Yeah, you're good.

1828
01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:43,520
- I wax.

1829
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:45,155
- It gets prickly.
It's disgusting.

1830
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:46,632
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

1831
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,225
- No, and, like, men are
allowed to have hair.

1832
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:50,493
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1833
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,661
- Can I kiss you?

1834
01:03:51,728 --> 01:03:53,096
- I think so.

1835
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:05,742
<i>- I'm on cloud nine.</i>

1836
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:09,179
<i>I had a fantastic
conversation with Gabby.</i>

1837
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,147
And then we shared
an amazing kiss,

1838
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:12,482
which is unbelievable.

1839
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:14,250
<i>It feels awesome.</i>

1840
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:16,696
- I was thinking about this,
I was like, man,

1841
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,588
if I'm gonna talk to Gabby

1842
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:20,023
and she's gonna offer me a rose,

1843
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:21,458
but then I go and have a great

1844
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,860
conversation with Rachel,
like, what...

1845
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:25,929
Is there gonna be
jealousy involved?

1846
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:27,130
I don't know, it's like...

1847
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,274
- Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

1848
01:04:28,298 --> 01:04:29,508
Like, how that...
If you get a rose

1849
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:30,976
from both,
how you gonna deal with that?

1850
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,311
- Or are they gonna just say,
"We don't like this guy.

1851
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:33,679
He's playing both fields,"
you know?

1852
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,637
- Yeah.

1853
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:35,715
- So how's your night going?

1854
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:37,073
- It's great.

1855
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,742
You settling in well? Nerves?

1856
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,543
- Yeah, I made some friends.

1857
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:41,544
I'm doing okay.

1858
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:43,847
- Good. So you're from...

1859
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,124
- I'm originally
from New Jersey.

1860
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:46,916
I grew up in a town
called Bedminster.

1861
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,485
Like, a very small town.
- Okay. Yeah.

1862
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,220
- It's, like, actually,
like, equestrian,

1863
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:52,021
New Jersey,
like, middle of nowhere.

1864
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:53,857
- Wow, I've never been
to New Jersey.

1865
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:56,192
I've been to New York,
like, a minute.

1866
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:58,395
- New York's amazing.
I'll take you around New York.

1867
01:04:58,461 --> 01:04:59,572
So, like, this is Manhattan.

1868
01:04:59,596 --> 01:05:01,364
- Okay, we got that...
We have a map.

1869
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:02,508
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right, I'm following.

1870
01:05:02,532 --> 01:05:03,600
- So, like, Central Park,

1871
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:04,701
you get, like, Midtown,

1872
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:07,137
you have East Village,
West Village.

1873
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:08,447
This is fun. All this is fun.
- Okay.

1874
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:10,540
- So I lived on the West Side.

1875
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:11,884
- Oh, so you were
right in the action.

1876
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,576
- In the mix, in the mix.
- Right there.

1877
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:16,579
- Yeah.
- Right on the edge of my mole.

1878
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,982
- Literally right there.
- I lived right there.

1879
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:21,551
- Actually, that's me.
That's literally me.

1880
01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:24,754
That's me in my apartment.

1881
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:25,889
- Ah, that's too funny.

1882
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:28,458
Rach and I had
a fantastic conversation.

1883
01:05:28,525 --> 01:05:29,926
We were hitting it off.

1884
01:05:29,993 --> 01:05:31,828
In through this. Yeah.

1885
01:05:31,895 --> 01:05:33,396
Yeah, yeah.

1886
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:34,640
- Oh, is this not good enough?

1887
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:36,666
- There it is, yes!
Let's go.

1888
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:38,177
I thought about going in
for a kiss and I was like,

1889
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:40,270
you know what,
I don't want to force anything.

1890
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:41,714
I want things
to happen organically.

1891
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:44,307
<i>So I am looking forward
to talking to her more.</i>

1892
01:05:44,374 --> 01:05:45,718
<i>I'm hoping that I made
a good impression today.</i>

1893
01:05:45,742 --> 01:05:46,976
<i>I think I did.</i>

1894
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,521
<i>There are obviously
two Bachelorettes,</i>

1895
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:49,779
<i>and they're both amazing.</i>

1896
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:51,157
<i>So I can see
how this is gonna get</i>

1897
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:52,382
<i>complicated very quickly.</i>

1898
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:53,917
It's gonna be interesting.

1899
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:56,729
- What if they give
the First Impression Rose

1900
01:05:56,753 --> 01:05:58,054
to the same person?

1901
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,657
- The odds of that are
like hitting the lottery.

1902
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:04,027
- You never know though.
You never know.

1903
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:10,667
Hello.

1904
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:12,068
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.

1905
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,169
How are we doing?

1906
01:06:13,236 --> 01:06:14,571
- Doing amazing.
How are you?

1907
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,406
- I'm doing well.

1908
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:20,009
I'll be back.

1909
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:21,845
- Securing the bag.

1910
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:23,480
- Okay.

1911
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:26,783
- There we go.

1912
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,151
One down.

1913
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:32,689
It kind of sucks that...

1914
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:34,791
she came right in,
went right out.

1915
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:36,192
<i>Rachel comes, like, charging in</i>

1916
01:06:36,259 --> 01:06:38,661
<i>and grabs
the First Impression Rose.</i>

1917
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:40,239
I was thinking,
maybe I might get this,

1918
01:06:40,263 --> 01:06:41,740
and then it didn't happen,
and then I was, like,

1919
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:42,699
<i>a little bit upset
and I was, like,</i>

1920
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:44,334
<i>kind of, like, disappointed.</i>

1921
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,502
- Whoo.

1922
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:48,271
It's cold now.

1923
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,739
<i>- The First Impression Rose</i>

1924
01:06:49,806 --> 01:06:53,009
is a huge deal to me.

1925
01:06:53,076 --> 01:06:54,344
Hi, guys.

1926
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,312
How's it going?

1927
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:58,081
<i>It has been something
that I thought</i>

1928
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:01,518
about all night,
and the decision is not easy.

1929
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,591
Tino, can I talk to you?
- Yes, ma'am.

1930
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:09,926
Absolutely.

1931
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:12,529
- Congratulations.

1932
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:13,706
- Let's just get going this way.

1933
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:14,731
- Oh, okay.

1934
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:16,132
- There you go.
- There you go.

1935
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:17,233
Knock one out.

1936
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:20,103
- See, now it feels real,
doesn't it?

1937
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:21,571
- Yeah, it just hit.

1938
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:23,039
I'm a little gut punched.

1939
01:07:23,106 --> 01:07:25,241
- A little sting.
That sunk in a little bit.

1940
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:29,045
- So...

1941
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,617
tonight has been
a whirlwind for me,

1942
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:38,321
and this is a really big deal,

1943
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:42,525
but I have been
thinking about you

1944
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:44,060
for a while,

1945
01:07:44,127 --> 01:07:47,797
and I really enjoyed
our conversation.

1946
01:07:47,864 --> 01:07:50,667
You made the stairs

1947
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:53,670
a better place for me
on night one.

1948
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:56,773
And I really look forward

1949
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:59,275
to getting to know you more.

1950
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:01,077
So, Tino,

1951
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:03,580
will you accept this rose?

1952
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:05,148
- Absolutely.

1953
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,819
- Looks good.

1954
01:08:09,886 --> 01:08:11,220
- Yeah, it looks good on me?

1955
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:12,488
- I think so.

1956
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,434
- Well, thank you.
I really appreciate that.

1957
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,594
I really liked
our conversation too.

1958
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,861
- I'm glad.

1959
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,063
- Yeah.

1960
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,266
I mean, I'm gonna try
to milk this

1961
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:24,767
as long as I can to talk to you.

1962
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:26,336
- You should.

1963
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:27,904
- I'm here to make you happy.

1964
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:43,119
- I feel so awesome.
So relieved.

1965
01:08:43,186 --> 01:08:47,290
<i>I'm so glad that me
and Rachel had time</i>

1966
01:08:47,357 --> 01:08:51,327
<i>and it was meaningful,
and I just... I have no doubt</i>

1967
01:08:51,394 --> 01:08:52,871
<i>in my mind
that we can build something</i>

1968
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:55,865
really special here,
so I'm so stoked about that.

1969
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:02,271
- Seems like Rachel had
more of a...

1970
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:05,341
She knew who she wanted,
like, whoever that is.

1971
01:09:05,408 --> 01:09:07,910
- Maybe Gabby's still
exploring everyone that's here

1972
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,713
and she's still trying to talk
to as many people as she can.

1973
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:12,048
- The rose is still in play.

1974
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,419
<i>- I'm like, okay,
there's one more rose left.</i>

1975
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,955
<i>My time with Gabby was amazing
and the First Impression Rose</i>

1976
01:09:19,022 --> 01:09:22,025
would be the best-case
scenario, but you never know.

1977
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:23,159
So we'll see.

1978
01:09:23,226 --> 01:09:25,962
- It's literally
do or die kind of vibe.

1979
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:33,269
- I'm feeling
a little nervous, right?

1980
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:35,538
I think everyone wants,
at least, some time to talk

1981
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:38,241
with either one of those
two beautiful girls, right?

1982
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:42,278
- I talked to Gabby early,
and I feel

1983
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,385
like it could be a possibility
I could get the rose.

1984
01:09:44,414 --> 01:09:46,182
- Hey, man, if I get one rose,

1985
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:47,850
I'll be happy,
you know what I'm saying?

1986
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:49,619
One will be good for me.

1987
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,822
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1988
01:09:52,889 --> 01:09:54,190
- All right,
who wants to give me

1989
01:09:54,257 --> 01:09:56,859
a dirty look?
I'll sit right here.

1990
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:59,495
- Tino got Rachel's
First Impression Rose tonight.

1991
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:01,364
<i>You know, I would have loved
for it to be me,</i>

1992
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:02,732
<i>but there's still Gabby,</i>

1993
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:04,443
<i>and hopefully I'll still have
my opportunity.</i>

1994
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:06,469
- We still got
one more rose here.

1995
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:09,539
- Yeah.

1996
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:10,773
<i>- How's it going?</i>

1997
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,076
- I just gave out
my First Impression Rose.

1998
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:14,277
- Oh, my God, to who?

1999
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:15,545
- Tino.

2000
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:16,713
- Oh, I love that.

2001
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:18,281
- I know.
- Oh, my God.

2002
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,116
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

2003
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:21,551
- Okay, so what are
your thoughts?

2004
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:23,219
Like, the first rose
of the season,

2005
01:10:23,286 --> 01:10:24,620
this is huge.

2006
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:25,922
- Yeah, I know.

2007
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:27,090
So big.

2008
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:28,424
I feel like they are just such

2009
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:29,592
a great group of men.

2010
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:31,594
Like, everyone's been
super honest

2011
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:34,664
and open and just, like, really
wanting to get to know us.

2012
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:35,798
- Absolutely.

2013
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:37,033
I'm here for this decision

2014
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,634
and I'm really excited for you,

2015
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:40,937
'cause it's really insane
giving out the first...

2016
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:43,206
Like, the first rose
of being the Bachelorette.

2017
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:44,440
- Oh, my gosh, I know.

2018
01:10:45,675 --> 01:10:47,143
- Okay, I think
I'm gonna go do it.

2019
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,377
- Go.
- Wish me luck.

2020
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:50,046
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

2021
01:10:50,113 --> 01:10:52,882
<i>I haven't been able to talk
to as many men as I hoped,</i>

2022
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:55,418
but there is a First Impression
Rose on the line.

2023
01:10:55,485 --> 01:10:57,754
I have had
such good conversations,

2024
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:00,423
but one guy is really
standing out to me.

2025
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:03,769
- I got some time.
- You got some time?

2026
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:04,803
- I got some quality time.

2027
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,896
I feel confident that I had

2028
01:11:06,963 --> 01:11:08,431
enough quality time with Gabby.

2029
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:10,399
- How'd it go?
- It went amazing.

2030
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:12,168
<i>I'm in a position
where I would love</i>

2031
01:11:12,235 --> 01:11:14,103
<i>to get
the First Impression Rose.</i>

2032
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,009
- I got time with both women,
but I'm wondering if I made

2033
01:11:20,076 --> 01:11:22,945
a big enough impression
to receive that rose.

2034
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:24,132
- All right, here she comes.

2035
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:38,594
- Mario,
can I take you for a second?

2036
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,597
- Ooh.

2037
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:43,199
- Hi.

2038
01:11:46,169 --> 01:11:48,037
- Oh!
- You okay? You good?

2039
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:50,039
- Yeah.
- Careful with your dress.

2040
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:52,017
- I think 'cause he's a dancer

2041
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:54,744
and, you know,
she likes that... you know,

2042
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:58,047
kind of, like, that,
you know, goofy kind of vibe.

2043
01:11:58,114 --> 01:12:00,016
- I mean, I guess.

2044
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:01,717
<i>Definitely disappointing.</i>

2045
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:03,586
Her and I, like,
had a great conversation,

2046
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,855
we even made out
and, like, I was

2047
01:12:05,922 --> 01:12:07,032
feeling pretty good
leaving there.

2048
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:09,358
Honestly, I thought I had
a shot with that.

2049
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:10,726
Not gonna lie.

2050
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:12,833
Then I watched both those
First Impression Roses go,

2051
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:14,263
and I was like, oh, damn.

2052
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,299
I'm kind of pissed,
to be honest.

2053
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:22,071
- Well, obviously...
- I have this.

2054
01:12:22,138 --> 01:12:23,138
- Oh, thank you... no.

2055
01:12:24,874 --> 01:12:26,509
- Oh, thank you. See you later.

2056
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:28,644
But I just wanted to tell you,

2057
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:32,415
I think, you know, you led
with really good questions

2058
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,684
and you're, like, so sweet
and genuine.

2059
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,986
I feel like we got off
to a right foot.

2060
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:38,053
So...
- Yeah.

2061
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:41,057
- Mario,
will you accept this rose?

2062
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:42,325
- I will.
- Yeah?

2063
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:45,995
- Oh, perfect.

2064
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:47,930
Thank you. I appreciate that.
- You're welcome.

2065
01:12:52,435 --> 01:12:55,705
<i>- I'm excited that Gabby and I
got off on the right foot.</i>

2066
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:57,740
You know, as the weeks
go on, hopefully

2067
01:12:57,807 --> 01:13:00,076
<i>we can continue
to build that connection.</i>

2068
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:01,310
<i>I'm pumped.</i>

2069
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,879
<i>I gotta keep
that momentum going.</i>

2070
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,180
<i>And I'm gonna continue to look</i>

2071
01:13:04,247 --> 01:13:06,015
<i>for opportunities
to build on top of that.</i>

2072
01:13:06,082 --> 01:13:07,326
<i>So I'm feeling really confident.</i>

2073
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:10,853
First Impression Rose.
Y'all see it. Yeah. Hey.

2074
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,155
First Impression Rose,
I says, y'all see it.

2075
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,423
Let's get it.

2076
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:16,325
- Well, we have
a Rose Ceremony in...

2077
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:18,995
Soon.

2078
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,264
Time's running out.
- It is.

2079
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:23,666
I have had zero time
with either of the women.

2080
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,401
<i>I'm starting to panic.</i>

2081
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:26,969
I would be devastated
to go home,

2082
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:28,113
you know, without the chance

2083
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:29,705
to at least speak
with one of them.

2084
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:33,075
- I feel really good
about the guys that are here,

2085
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:36,479
but I do feel so bad that we
didn't get to talk to so many.

2086
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:39,382
There's just... I mean, it's
the biggest group of guys ever.

2087
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:40,816
- I feel the same way.

2088
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:42,051
- I don't know.

2089
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:43,052
- Yeah.

2090
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:44,587
- This is, like, confusing.

2091
01:13:44,654 --> 01:13:46,255
- How you guys all doing?

2092
01:13:46,322 --> 01:13:47,356
How we doing?

2093
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:50,192
Well, gentlemen, look,
of course I understand

2094
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,862
you're having a great time,
but it is that time.

2095
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:54,473
The party is now over
and we do now have

2096
01:13:54,497 --> 01:13:56,165
to get ready
for the Rose Ceremony.

2097
01:13:56,232 --> 01:13:57,832
Gentlemen, thank you,
we'll see you soon.

2098
01:14:00,236 --> 01:14:01,604
- I mean, I think we can agree

2099
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:03,511
there's people we don't
feel a connection with,

2100
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:05,441
but this is our journey

2101
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:07,476
and it's never been done before,

2102
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:08,811
we've never had this many men,

2103
01:14:08,878 --> 01:14:10,980
so I don't see
why we couldn't bend the rules

2104
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:12,148
at least a little bit.

2105
01:14:12,214 --> 01:14:13,516
- Yeah.
- Let's do this.

2106
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:18,154
<i>- This was something that
I did not even think would be</i>

2107
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,122
<i>a possibility
that I would come here</i>

2108
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:22,925
and not even get to say
more than just, like,

2109
01:14:22,992 --> 01:14:25,661
"Hi" or a couple words
to Gabby or Rachel.

2110
01:14:25,728 --> 01:14:28,698
<i>So I have it in my mind
that I'm about to go home.</i>

2111
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:31,200
- All right, what's going on?

2112
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:32,601
Are you ready?

2113
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:33,679
- Well, we're
kind of wondering...

2114
01:14:33,703 --> 01:14:35,004
- That's the problem.

2115
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:38,140
- If there's a different way
of going about things.

2116
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,451
- You guys can do
whatever you want.

2117
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,044
Listen, your journey,
you call the shots.

2118
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:43,322
- Yeah.
- Here's what I would tell you.

2119
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:44,380
- Uh-huh.

2120
01:14:44,447 --> 01:14:45,915
- If there are people
here tonight

2121
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,926
that you know in your hearts
you don't have a future with...

2122
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,151
- Mm-hmm.

2123
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:50,920
- Do you really want
to string them along?

2124
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:56,258
<i>- My heart's pounding.</i>

2125
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,660
There's not gonna be 30 roses

2126
01:14:57,727 --> 01:14:59,829
given out, I know that.

2127
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:01,815
<i>I'm just wondering
how many of us are going home.</i>

2128
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,534
- It's definitely
a tough situation right now.

2129
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:06,936
<i>Some guys are
going home tonight,</i>

2130
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:08,904
<i>and that's the reality
of the deal.</i>

2131
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:10,406
<i>I just hope it's not me.</i>

2132
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:13,876
- Feel like you know
what you're gonna do?

2133
01:15:13,943 --> 01:15:15,411
- Yeah.
- All right.

2134
01:15:15,478 --> 01:15:17,813
- After talking with Rachel
and kind of deciding

2135
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,116
how we want to move forward,
I'm sure that the guys are

2136
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,702
<i>probably gonna have
their own questions</i>

2137
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:23,519
<i>and be really shocked.</i>

2138
01:15:23,586 --> 01:15:25,855
<i>But we do know
what we need to do.</i>

2139
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:47,910
- All right. Hi, you guys.

2140
01:15:50,246 --> 01:15:54,050
We know it has been
an incredibly long night,

2141
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:57,186
and we appreciate
you all being here.

2142
01:15:57,253 --> 01:16:00,156
But for the sake of time,
we were not able

2143
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,625
to, of course,
get to all of you tonight.

2144
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:04,927
- Yeah,
it's definitely bittersweet.

2145
01:16:04,994 --> 01:16:07,530
Like Rachel said,
we know it's such a long night.

2146
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:09,131
We've been
in your position before,

2147
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:12,101
like you know,
and it's not ideal.

2148
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:13,636
So I really am sorry

2149
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:17,006
for everyone
we didn't get to talk to.

2150
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:22,545
- With that being said,
would Roby, Justin, and Joey,

2151
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:25,681
would you mind talking
to us for a second?

2152
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:31,353
- Thank you.

2153
01:16:33,122 --> 01:16:34,457
- Interesting.

2154
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:35,991
Interesting.

2155
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:43,399
- There are
so many incredible men

2156
01:16:43,466 --> 01:16:46,302
that I was looking forward
to talking to tonight.

2157
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:49,505
<i>Some guys who really caught
my eye coming out of the limo.</i>

2158
01:16:49,572 --> 01:16:51,941
<i>But the night is coming
to a close</i>

2159
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:54,877
<i>and I still haven't talked
to a majority of them.</i>

2160
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:58,647
It's really nerve-racking,
but I think

2161
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:01,150
being able to talk to Gabby
and really bounce ideas

2162
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:02,685
off each other, I feel confident

2163
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:04,653
in the decision
that we made tonight.

2164
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:09,458
First of all, we really

2165
01:17:09,525 --> 01:17:13,062
appreciate you guys coming
and joining us tonight.

2166
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,639
- Appreciate it, yeah.
- Yeah, thank you

2167
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:15,698
so much for your time.

2168
01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:17,533
I know how hard it is.

2169
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:20,269
- But I think moving forward,

2170
01:17:20,336 --> 01:17:22,671
being able to talk
to you guys tonight...

2171
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:25,908
We've kind of come to a decision

2172
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:29,278
that there might not be
a connection there for us.

2173
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:35,918
So we really, really appreciate
you guys coming.

2174
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:37,820
Can we say goodbye?
- Sure.

2175
01:17:37,887 --> 01:17:39,255
- Yeah.
- We appreciate it.

2176
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,456
- Yes, of course.

2177
01:17:40,523 --> 01:17:41,824
Thank you, guys.

2178
01:17:41,891 --> 01:17:44,260
<i>This is a really,
really hard moment.</i>

2179
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,795
This is the first time
that we are

2180
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:49,598
having to break up with someone.

2181
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:52,334
<i>It is so hard in the moment
to know that we can</i>

2182
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:55,337
inflict pain on other people
and that it is a part

2183
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:57,039
of the role
as being a Bachelorette.

2184
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:02,645
- Gabby and I have been
in their shoes before,

2185
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:06,415
and we know how scary it is
to put yourself out there,

2186
01:18:06,482 --> 01:18:10,052
<i>but there are gonna be
many times where Gabby and I</i>

2187
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:12,188
<i>are gonna have to make
difficult decisions.</i>

2188
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:15,157
<i>And I think we need to be
assertive tonight</i>

2189
01:18:15,224 --> 01:18:18,160
and really show the guys
that we are serious,

2190
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:21,096
and when we don't feel
a connection, we don't.

2191
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:23,032
<i>Because it is
Gabby and I's decision</i>

2192
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:24,266
<i>at the end of the day.</i>

2193
01:18:27,503 --> 01:18:30,105
- Thank you guys
for being so patient.

2194
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:33,709
We know tonight has been
such a long night.

2195
01:18:33,776 --> 01:18:36,912
- And just keeping
with the theme

2196
01:18:36,979 --> 01:18:38,380
of open communication,

2197
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:41,784
we did also want to let
you guys know that we were both

2198
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:46,088
able to talk to Roby,
Joey, and Justin tonight,

2199
01:18:46,155 --> 01:18:47,690
and although
they are incredible,

2200
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:49,225
we felt as though

2201
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:50,893
we did not have
a connection with them,

2202
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,663
so that is why they're
not here with us right now.

2203
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:57,333
- And tonight,
we felt like we didn't

2204
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:00,269
have enough time
to really get to know you all,

2205
01:19:00,336 --> 01:19:02,404
and that would be doing ourself

2206
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:04,406
and you all a disservice.

2207
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:08,410
So we are asking you
to move forward with us

2208
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:11,947
next week and cancel
the Rose Ceremony tonight.

2209
01:19:12,014 --> 01:19:13,349
- 1,000%.
- Absolutely.

2210
01:19:15,017 --> 01:19:16,852
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God.

2211
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:21,490
- Coming to the decision
with Rachel to cancel

2212
01:19:21,557 --> 01:19:25,127
the Rose Ceremony is the first
glimpse of what we're getting,

2213
01:19:25,194 --> 01:19:27,463
that this journey
is going to be really hard.

2214
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:29,698
- Thank you guys
for being patient with us.

2215
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,334
And for those of you
we did not speak to tonight,

2216
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:34,870
we look forward to getting
to know you better next week.

2217
01:19:34,937 --> 01:19:37,539
- But I feel like
I really could start to build

2218
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,643
relationships with just the few
conversations that I've had.

2219
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:43,078
Whoo-hoo, champagne.
- Ooh!

2220
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:44,513
<i>- I feel like we're starting off</i>

2221
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:45,881
<i>to a really good start</i>

2222
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:47,549
<i>that will set us up for success</i>

2223
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,952
<i>and truly finding our husbands
at the end of this.</i>

2224
01:19:50,019 --> 01:19:52,588
<i>But there's never been
two Bachelorettes before,</i>

2225
01:19:52,655 --> 01:19:55,190
<i>so who knows
what's gonna happen?</i>

2226
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:56,692
To love.

2227
01:19:56,759 --> 01:19:59,028
To love.

2228
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:01,297
<i>- This season,
on "The Bachelorette"...</i>

2229
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:03,365
Gabby and Rachel!

2230
01:20:03,432 --> 01:20:05,668
We're the Bachelorette!

2231
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:08,103
<i>- What more could
two best friends ever want</i>

2232
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:10,673
<i>than to travel the world,
fall in love,</i>

2233
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:13,909
<i>and experience the best
moments of our lives together?</i>

2234
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:16,078
Let's do it!
- Bring on the men.

2235
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:21,650
<i>- No one has any idea
of how this is gonna work.</i>

2236
01:20:21,717 --> 01:20:24,186
<i>So we're figuring out things
as we go.</i>

2237
01:20:24,253 --> 01:20:28,490
- We have decided
we are gonna switch partners.

2238
01:20:30,626 --> 01:20:33,696
- I feel
like we're two teenagers.

2239
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:35,431
- Falling in love in Paris.

2240
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:36,741
Ho, ho, oui, oui!

2241
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:38,233
<i>- I can't wait for us</i>

2242
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,135
to get engaged
on the same day...

2243
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:42,738
- Yeah.
- And have matching houses

2244
01:20:42,805 --> 01:20:43,872
next to each other.

2245
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:45,407
This is crazy!

2246
01:20:45,474 --> 01:20:49,144
- Oh, my gosh.
She's an athlete too.

2247
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:51,413
<i>- They're both amazing,
beautiful women</i>

2248
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,815
<i>wanting to find love.</i>

2249
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:54,850
<i>- They both everything
that I want in a wife.</i>

2250
01:20:54,917 --> 01:20:56,494
<i>- Like, how do you choose
between those two?</i>

2251
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:57,786
Oh!

2252
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,722
<i>I have never felt
like this before.</i>

2253
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,191
<i>You truly are
the man of my dreams.</i>

2254
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,296
There's our ride.

2255
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:08,530
<i>- Oh, that's amazing.</i>

2256
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:11,567
<i>- I am definitely
falling in love.</i>

2257
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:15,003
We're getting engaged!

2258
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:17,406
- Do y'all have a preference
of Rachel or Gabby?

2259
01:21:19,742 --> 01:21:21,977
Yeah, it's gonna be
tough to decide.

2260
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:23,188
- There's gonna become a point

2261
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,747
where they're gonna want us
to choose.

2262
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:26,315
<i>- A lot of guys are
on the fence.</i>

2263
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:29,118
<i>- No one's really ready
to pick a lane and stay in it.</i>

2264
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:31,019
- They have the control.
- Yeah.

2265
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:33,655
- And they, like, know it.
- This is my nightmare.

2266
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,991
- Will you accept this rose?

2267
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:38,227
- I'm sorry. I cannot.

2268
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:39,962
I'm here for Gabby.

2269
01:21:41,697 --> 01:21:43,966
<i>- It seems cruel for both of us</i>

2270
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:46,301
<i>to be put in this place
together.</i>

2271
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:48,637
- I am gonna have to decline
the rose.

2272
01:21:48,704 --> 01:21:50,215
<i>- I don't know how
I'm supposed to fall in love</i>

2273
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,774
<i>when no one gives a about me.</i>

2274
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,308
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

2275
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:56,645
This is not supposed to be
like this.

2276
01:21:56,712 --> 01:22:00,416
- I do have my intentions
solely for Rachel.

2277
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:02,785
<i>- He said he can't love me.</i>

2278
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:04,386
Am I not good enough?

2279
01:22:04,453 --> 01:22:05,988
<i>- They're ruining everything</i>

2280
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:08,390
<i>trying to decide what they want.</i>

2281
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:12,127
And here we are, a big mess.

2282
01:22:12,194 --> 01:22:13,695
<i>- Both women are being played.</i>

2283
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:16,198
<i>- I'm into him
and she's into him.</i>

2284
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:17,566
<i>- He told the guys,</i>

2285
01:22:17,633 --> 01:22:20,102
"I can't trust these bitches."

2286
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:22,738
<i>It's just, like, validating
all my fears.</i>

2287
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:26,708
<i>Am I too broken
for anyone to love?</i>

2288
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:30,712
- Things have obviously taken
a turn.

2289
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,448
- Yeah.
- What do you wanna do?

2290
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:35,317
- I need to tell her
this full truth.

2291
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:41,423
<i>I just don't understand.</i>

2292
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:44,026
<i>You changed your mind?</i>

2293
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:46,595
- What's going on?

2294
01:22:46,662 --> 01:22:49,298
- I still have feelings...

2295
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:50,299
on the other side.

2296
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:51,767
<i>- Why?</i>

2297
01:22:51,834 --> 01:22:54,269
<i>Why me? Why now?</i>

2298
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,707
<i>- I'm such a failure
as a Bachelorette.</i>

2299
01:22:58,774 --> 01:23:01,477
<i>I don't wanna do this anymore.</i>

2300
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:04,213
<i>I would rather be alone.</i>

2301
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:06,582
<i>- What if I'm not ready?</i>

2302
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:09,551
<i>Why did they pick me to do this?</i>

2303
01:23:10,519 --> 01:23:12,421
I don't know what to do.

2304
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:15,257
<i>This journey
finding love together,</i>

2305
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:16,658
<i>it's messy.</i>

2306
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:18,527
<i>I just hope that,
for both of us,</i>

2307
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:19,862
<i>it's worth it.</i>

2308
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,504
- Blanco, what do you think
about Jacob?

2309
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:29,972
Can we pet him?

2310
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:31,340
- I want to pet Blanco.

2311
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:33,151
- I'm 'bout to hop on a horse
and meet them again.

2312
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:34,343
- Go steal it.
Go steal it.

2313
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:35,644
- Blanco.

2314
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:37,179
Sit.
- Come here, Blanco.

2315
01:23:37,246 --> 01:23:39,348
Shake.

2316
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:41,283
Oh, no... oh, no!

2317
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:44,453
- Blanco has diarrhea.

2318
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,122
- Oh!

2319
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:49,258
- Is that a bad sign?

2320
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:51,793
- Oh, my God.
- That can't be good.

2321
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,662
- They got the horse
out here pooping

2322
01:23:53,729 --> 01:23:55,597
in the middle of the limo spot.

2323
01:23:55,664 --> 01:23:57,266
- I've seen it all.
I'm outta here.

2324
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:58,332
- That's gnarly.

2325
01:23:58,367 --> 01:23:59,611
- I'm out of here.
- That's gnarly.

2326
01:23:59,635 --> 01:24:00,969
- I just seen a whole horse...

2327
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:03,105
- That's gnarly,
like, right here.

2328
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:04,706
- That is not it.

2329
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:05,707
That is not it.

2330
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:08,477
- Aww, poor Blanco.

2331
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:09,754
- Think I'm just gonna
shovel it.

2332
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:11,046
- Way to go.

2333
01:24:11,113 --> 01:24:13,215
- Did not know this was
in the job description.

2334
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:14,449
- We appreciate you.

2335
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:15,551
- You got it.

2336
01:24:16,685 --> 01:24:17,786
- There you go.

2337
01:24:17,853 --> 01:24:19,354
That's good.

2338
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:20,989
Okay, be careful
where you fling it.

2339
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,225
- Blanco,
this is all your fault!

2340
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:25,494
Blanco!

2341
01:24:25,518 --> 01:24:27,518
