1
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:03,370
- Tonight on
"The Bachelorette"...

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,708
- Bring it on.

3
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,846
- This is definitely not

4
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:14,214
the normal situation

5
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:15,883
because we do have
two Bachelorettes.

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,252
- Do you think it's gonna be
two separate group dates,

7
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:19,987
or are they both
gonna be on one?

8
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,822
- I cannot prepare for anything.

9
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,366
- How this is gonna work
with two Bachelorettes

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,492
is one of the biggest things
on everybody's mind.

11
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:26,960
- Whoo!

12
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,195
- There's two Bachelorettes.

13
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:29,806
I want to start
being able to figure out

14
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,298
which way am I leaning.

15
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,100
- What's up, Gabby?
What's up, Rachel?

16
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,935
What's up, Gabby?
What's up, Rachel?

17
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,479
- It's complicated
because you're dealing

18
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,138
with two amazing women,

19
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,440
but they have polar opposite
personalities.

20
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,743
- Things will get messy.
I have no doubt about it.

21
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,745
- There has to be
a point in this

22
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,980
where they're both gonna like
the same person.

23
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,249
- Can I kiss you?
- Yeah.

24
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:50,426
- I do have to tell you
something.

25
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,586
- What?
- I kissed Logan.

26
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,455
- What I'm not interested in,
is you guys' way

27
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,124
of going about this process.

28
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,860
- That is a form of control,
and that is manipulative.

29
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,395
- I feel really bad.

30
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,996
He's, like, this incredible guy,

31
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,631
but then something's off.

32
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,500
I just don't know what to do.

33
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,736
- Everything's just way harder
than I expected.

34
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,573
- We have no idea
what's going to happen.

35
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,816
- Do you feel like it's
appropriate to be

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,642
talking about
Fantasy Suites this early?

37
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,078
I do think it would be time
for you to go.

38
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,279
- You came back.

39
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,480
- Can we interrupt you guys?

40
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,147
- Yeah, you need to...
- What's going on?

41
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,552
We did ask you to leave.

42
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,866
- Last night was crazy.

43
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,569
I feel like we have so much
time to make up for...

44
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,471
We have 29 guys.

45
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,540
And we didn't talk to more
than half of them.

46
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,975
- I literally can't believe it.

47
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,078
I can't believe we canceled
the Rose Ceremony.

48
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,579
- We had to.
- Yeah.

49
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:55,048
- But I'm looking forward
to, like, having a group date

50
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,417
this week and really
getting to know the people

51
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,653
that we haven't spoken to yet.
- Yeah.

52
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,689
- But like, what can we do?
Like, it's so rainy.

53
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,191
- I know, I know.

54
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,235
Initially, we were talking
so much about a pool party...

55
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,894
- Yeah.
- Which would have been nice

56
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,397
to, like, see
their six-pack abs, yeah.

57
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:14,134
- Like, how do we get them
to show us their six-pack abs?

58
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,402
- Yeah.
- When it's raining.

59
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,104
- Without being too obvious.

60
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,373
- We have to come up
with some idea.

61
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,746
- Last night,

62
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,048
after the Rose Ceremony
was canceled,

63
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,017
29 of us moved into the mansion.

64
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:34,254
There's not enough beds
for all of us.

65
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,732
I mean, you can't walk
around this mansion

66
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,391
without stepping on someone.

67
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,601
- All right,
we're making breakfast?

68
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,826
- Yeah, I'll make some eggs.

69
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,628
- I got you, I got you.
- We need bowls.

70
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,575
- Got, like, a lot of OJ,
or a little bit of OJ?

71
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,899
- Right there. You...
- Hey, watch your eyes.

72
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,002
Opa!

73
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,270
I'm trying to get a grasp

74
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,005
on how the rest of the week
is gonna go.

75
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,116
I don't know
if they're gonna split it up,

76
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,541
like, half and half.

77
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,977
Is Gabby gonna take
the guys that she's feeling?

78
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,346
Is Rachel gonna take
the men she's feeling?

79
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:00,681
How many one-on-ones?

80
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,182
Are there gonna be
any one-on-ones?

81
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,751
- So you think it's gonna be
two separate group dates

82
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,420
or are they both
gonna be on one?

83
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,888
- I hope they just give
a one-on-one

84
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,632
to a guy that they haven't
even talked to yet.

85
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,391
That would be phenomenal.

86
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,802
- I think that's gonna be
really tough

87
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,294
'cause there's so many guys.

88
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,463
I mean, we're here to hopefully

89
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,665
get an engagement at the end
of the day, you know,

90
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,300
really fall in love
with somebody.

91
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,578
And how do you do that if you
don't even speak with them?

92
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,404
I have no idea
what's gonna happen,

93
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,473
but that makes it fun.

94
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,444
- Surprise!

95
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,650
- How is everyone?
- How are you?

96
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,951
Today, we have something

97
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,786
really special planned
for the guys.

98
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,656
Of course, last night didn't
really go as planned.

99
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,891
We didn't get to talk
to half the guys.

100
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,359
- We saved a seat for you.

101
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,395
- Oh, my gosh, thank you.
- Yeah.

102
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,664
- Are you guys excited to be
in the mansion,

103
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,699
finally out of the hotel?

104
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,068
- We want a way
for the men to go

105
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:58,071
one by one and show us
their personality.

106
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,058
And I think it'll give us,
like, a bigger picture

107
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,784
of who they are,
because we only got to see,

108
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,844
you know, three seconds
of some of them.

109
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,580
Since there's so many of us,
we wanted to think of something

110
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,950
that we could get to know
you guys kind of individually.

111
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,018
So naturally,
we thought a pageant

112
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,421
would be the best way...

113
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,923
- A little talent show.

114
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,559
- A little talent,
a little interview.

115
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,061
But before we get started,

116
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,629
we have one last thing
for you guys.

117
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:23,697
- Really?
- Yeah.

118
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,032
To help you along, maybe.

119
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,033
- Uh-oh.

120
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,771
- Your first gifts, yeah.

121
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,106
Don't look.

122
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:36,209
- So you guys have
30 minutes to prepare,

123
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,878
and you guys better bring it.

124
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,380
We'll see you soon.

125
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,482
- Oh, mysterious.
I like it.

126
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,317
- Hey, what's in there?
What's in there?

127
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,619
- Open it up.
- So the girls,

128
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,263
before they left,
dropped off some gifts.

129
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,356
And I was thinking,
"Oh, what's in the bags?"

130
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,358
You know, what kind of gifts?
I love gifts.

131
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,594
- Speedos!
- What?

132
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,464
Little did I know it was gonna
be this type of gift.

133
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,091
- All right, guys,
let's go get changed.

134
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,269
- Oh, my...
- Bro.

135
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,339
- Oh, there's no chance
these fit.

136
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,542
Zero chance.

137
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,677
- This is wild!

138
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,612
- I was expecting maybe
something a little bit,

139
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,414
you know, slower and like,

140
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,049
"Hey, let's get
to know each other."

141
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,051
And then it's boom.

142
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,953
We're in Speedos.

143
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,456
- Yeah, they don't cover up
very much.

144
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,724
- 200.

145
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,729
I'm honestly ready to show them

146
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,131
everything that
they need to see.

147
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,066
And that's not just outside
but that's inside.

148
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,969
- It's like every day is more
nervous than the last day.

149
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,238
So I'm actually really hairy.

150
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:39,472
So... and pale.

151
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,859
I was expecting
to present myself,

152
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,043
but not with a Speedo on.

153
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,178
- Is that a sock in there?
- Yeah.

154
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,179
- This guy's cheating!
- Put another one in there.

155
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,180
Put another one in there.

156
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,415
This is insane.

157
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,051
I'm about to go on national TV
in a Speedo.

158
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,853
It covers next to nothing.

159
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,422
- I appreciate this, guys.
I'm gonna remember this.

160
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,357
- The things you do
for love, right?

161
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,326
- All right, fellas.
Come on downstairs.

162
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,894
I'll meet you
in the living room.

163
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,495
- Bring it on.

164
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,367
Let's bring it!
- Let's do it!

165
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,935
- Bring on the men.

166
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,837
It's a little hot in here.

167
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,240
We're ready.
Bring it on.

168
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,275
- See 'em in Speedos, baby.

169
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,210
This is great.

170
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,879
- I know, I'm sweatin'.

171
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,580
- All right, gentlemen,

172
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,315
you are gonna be
competing here today

173
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,284
in a pageant of sorts,

174
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,886
for both Gabby and Rachel.

175
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,756
And the prize today,
it could not be bigger.

176
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,491
Whoever does the best
here today,

177
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,260
the guys who show
the most heart,

178
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,061
the guys who show
the most creativity,

179
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,298
maybe the most skin,
just saying,

180
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:41,534
will get invited back
to Gabby and Rachel's place

181
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:45,005
later tonight for a very
exclusive afterparty.

182
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,677
- The prize of being able
to go back to their house

183
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,188
and have a party
with the two of them,

184
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,380
I mean, that's high stakes.

185
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,015
I didn't get
the opportunity to spend

186
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,750
much time with them last night,

187
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,752
so I'll do whatever it takes.

188
00:06:58,818 --> 00:06:59,896
- So this is how this is
gonna work.

189
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,054
You will disrobe,

190
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,723
and you will show us
your "look,"

191
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,625
forward and backwards.

192
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,960
- Oh, my...
- Yes.

193
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,261
- Whoo-hoo!

194
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,597
- Up first, Logan.

195
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,467
- Sorry to my mom,
sorry to my dad,

196
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,602
sorry to my grammy.

197
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:16,870
Uh, to my niece?

198
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,205
Never watch this.

199
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,640
- Some support, yes.

200
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,409
Shoes and socks.

201
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,977
- I'm gonna make a fool
of myself,

202
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,912
but I'm gonna go all out.

203
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,515
This is part of the deal.
This is how you find love.

204
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,693
- Let the competition begin.

205
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,594
Up first, Logan.

206
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,304
- Oh, my God.

207
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,473
- I can't make eye contact.
- Yeah, I'm like, mm.

208
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,874
- I don't know where to look.

209
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,445
- Today's group date is like
a beauty pageant...

210
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,046
Bachelor style.

211
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,583
And the winners get to have
more intimate time tonight,

212
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,785
so there is a lot on the line.

213
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,121
- Gabby, Rachel, you have any
questions for Logan Palmer?

214
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,356
- We do.

215
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,559
How would your exes
describe you?

216
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,728
- A bit stubborn.
That's a good word.

217
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,297
Honest, kind.

218
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:18,665
- Love it.

219
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,134
Logan has definitely
been on my radar

220
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,135
since night one,

221
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,738
and today isn't any different.

222
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,373
I think we're ready for talent.

223
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,141
- All right, ladies,

224
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,177
before a relationship turns
into a beautiful, uh...

225
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,712
butterfly,

226
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,615
it has to start as a worm.

227
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:45,392
- Oh, my God.
Like a true professional!

228
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,960
- It was nice,
with Logan going first,

229
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,428
to go in there fully confident,

230
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:49,796
hit his worm to perfection.

231
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,931
Everybody go crazy in the crowd.

232
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,342
I think he really set the tone
for all of us

233
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,667
to step our games up.

234
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,870
- Let me show you what a real
man's body looks like.

235
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,913
- So many butts,

236
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,015
so many dudes
who don't skip leg day.

237
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,116
- It's unbelievable.

238
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,663
It's just like me looking
in a mirror.

239
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,355
- When you're wearing
a Speedo, it's nice and snug.

240
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,791
You can feel it
kind of ride up at times,

241
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,926
and you got to get rid
of that wedgie.

242
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,462
- I've never went to a store
and thought,

243
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,863
yeah, let me get the thong one.

244
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,099
Yeah, the one that gets
in the crease.

245
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,772
- Whapow!

246
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,283
- This is something
I do not normally do.

247
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,161
But it was like, bro,
the stakes were on the line.

248
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,495
- Do you feel like
this is something

249
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,454
you could wear regularly?

250
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,855
Like, what if we asked?

251
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,390
- Please, no, please no.

252
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:53,860
- Stiff competition.

253
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,430
I think we're ready
for the talent.

254
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,534
Today I'm just looking for

255
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,881
maybe a little bit
of creativity,

256
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,606
how much fun can you have
with the talent?

257
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,541
- My mind's been spinning
about all the ways

258
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,276
that I could connect with you.

259
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,579
About all the things
that I could show you.

260
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,582
- The things that I look for
are definitely confidence,

261
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,418
effort, and how willing you
are to kind of commit today.

262
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,897
- We both want them to show us
their personality.

263
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,465
Oh!

264
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:36,035
- I think it'll be good to just
get a feel of who they are.

265
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,337
- All right, ladies.

266
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:41,941
This talent is very important.

267
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,877
I'm gonna help you guys
save $60,000 a year

268
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,512
on a 30-year fixed mortgage.

269
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,916
So let's talk about debts.

270
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,217
- I'm taking notes.

271
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,220
- Jacob is Tarzan,

272
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:59,092
dressed like George of
the Jungle/my mortgage broker.

273
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,194
I liked it. I was into it.

274
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,996
I appreciated the glasses.

275
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,373
- All right, next up,
he makes the best

276
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,965
6-foot meatball sub
in the world,

277
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,467
Meatball!

278
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,678
- Yeah, I'm just trying to,
you know, impress the ladies.

279
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,471
I think they want to see
our personalities,

280
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,806
and Meatball always comes up
with something interesting.

281
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,675
Gotta be patient. You'll see.

282
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,044
What are meatballs...

283
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,846
- I'm scared.
- Without some sauce?

284
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,549
- No!

285
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,086
No!

286
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,555
- No! No!

287
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,657
God!

288
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:31,967
- I honestly think
it's gonna take

289
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,469
a while for me to eat
spaghetti sauce.

290
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,295
I mean, even just the smells
in the room

291
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,672
and then associating
that with him

292
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,831
pouring it on his body,
I was like...

293
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,935
- It smells just like spaghetti.

294
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,371
- I'm Italian,
but I don't do canned sauce.

295
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,876
- How many serious
relationships have you been in?

296
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,478
- So what is your
beauty routine?

297
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,347
- Hufflepuff or Gryffindor?

298
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:57,317
I think with the questions,
it's gonna be important to see

299
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,718
if they're gonna answer honestly

300
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,920
and really try and get to know
the important parts.

301
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,256
Kind of core values, I think,
will be important.

302
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,727
- Oh, I love Johnny.
- Oh, my God.

303
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,730
I think Rachel and I find a lot
of the same guys attractive,

304
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,232
and there's some overlap,

305
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,434
but we are allowing
ourselves space

306
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,269
to kind of figure it out
together.

307
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,472
Johnny, if you could kiss
one of us right now,

308
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,040
which one would it be?

309
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,545
- Is there a chance
that I can pick both?

310
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,815
- Absolutely.
- Good answer.

311
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,885
- Oh, he's confident.

312
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,587
In the Speedo!

313
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,624
- Johnny's wearing
the pilot hat.

314
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,692
Have to take notice of that.

315
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,793
It was pretty hot.

316
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,861
- Chris.

317
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,563
- So what's gonna happen is,

318
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,974
I'm gonna start a beat
for you guys.

319
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,299
If, when I dribble the ball,

320
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,606
you guys could stomp your feet,

321
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,411
and when I slap the ball,
you can clap your hands?

322
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,503
All right.

323
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,243
I'm totally crushing it.

324
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,679
So what I did was,
I gave them a little taste

325
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,257
of three things that are
really important to me.

326
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,582
One of those things is sports.

327
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:03,726
One of those things is music.

328
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,884
One thing is leadership.

329
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,455
Ultimately, like, I believe
I'm, like, the alpha.

330
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,157
I'm, like, number one leader.

331
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,793
- Whoo!

332
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,378
Personally made song
right there on the spot.

333
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,247
Did you have a question for me?

334
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,815
- Honestly, no question.

335
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,395
- Gabby and Rachel,
they are gonna head back

336
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,254
to their place,
and they're gonna decide

337
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:45,258
who they're gonna invite
to this exclusive afterparty.

338
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,669
- I think it's gonna be
a tough decision,

339
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:49,529
but to have them pick you now
is just, like, huge.

340
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,564
- I did all I could
with what I had.

341
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,466
Everybody feels like
they did enough,

342
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,234
but it's fair game for anybody.

343
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,804
- I feel like we got to know
you guys a little bit better,

344
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,606
and this decision is not
gonna be easy.

345
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,486
I will be there.

346
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,592
- If we can put our
glasses higher,

347
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,228
let's do a toast to putting
your cheeks out there today.

348
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,965
What is that?

349
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,101
Hey, someone go get it.
- I got it, I got it.

350
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,169
- Today, I was in a Speedo

351
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,372
in front of 30 other guys,
Jesse Palmer,

352
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,806
Rachel, Gabby.

353
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,451
Yeah, and after putting
it all on the line,

354
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:38,311
there's no question that I want
to be on the date card.

355
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,246
An envelope.

356
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,753
- For those lucky guys
who get to go,

357
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,650
it's a big moment because
it's a lot of alone time.

358
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,423
- Aven.

359
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,259
Logan.

360
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,062
Brandan.

361
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,931
Jason.

362
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,601
Johnny.

363
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,238
And Colin.

364
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,454
- You know, I kind of left it
all out there.

365
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,780
You know, literally, like,

366
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,249
my ass cheeks were outside
today, you know?

367
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,351
Not hearing my name,
I'm just like,

368
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,520
is there something
I could have done better?

369
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,456
- I'm excited.
It's gonna be a fun experience.

370
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,491
- Honestly, like, for you guys
who are going,

371
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,160
the six of you...

372
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,895
there's some people,
including myself,

373
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,197
who they don't need a test
with right now,

374
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,032
who they already know
how they feel.

375
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,036
But for those of you
who are going,

376
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,338
it's awesome to you guys,
so hope you have a good time.

377
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,578
- How do you feel?

378
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,647
- It's nerve-racking.
- It is.

379
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,915
I'm excited, though.

380
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,117
I think we're gonna
settle in just fine.

381
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,718
Today went really smoothly.

382
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,654
We had so much fun with the men.

383
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,858
I'm so excited for this to be
our first, like, afterparty.

384
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,426
- All right, boys,
let's do this.

385
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,300
Hey!

386
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,101
- Come on in!
- How are you?

387
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,370
- Tonight would be a good night

388
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:15,475
for us to kind of get an idea
of who is more compatible.

389
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,043
I do think
it's going to be telling

390
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,479
on who may be the guys
we vibe with more.

391
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,113
We're really excited
to have you.

392
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,850
This is our first date night,

393
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,551
so cheers to you guys.

394
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,687
Cheers.

395
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,856
- I am really looking forward

396
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,424
to getting to know Jason.

397
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,759
He definitely caught Gabby
and I's eye today,

398
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,763
so I'm excited to see how he is
more on one-on-one time.

399
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,065
Thank you!

400
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,734
Best-case scenario,
I get a kiss.

401
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,436
Maybe two.

402
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,171
- How's it going
for you, though?

403
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,572
- I wanted to ask you.

404
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,407
- Two Bachelorettes,
like, this is crazy.

405
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,610
- How do you feel
about that, like...

406
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,280
- Yeah.
- With both of us?

407
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,116
- It's been wild to just, like,
do this.

408
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,851
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I don't know.

409
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,353
I feel like I should be upfront.

410
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,622
To be honest,
like, when I got here,

411
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,692
like, I felt, like,
a connection to Gabby.

412
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,795
Yeah, and like, you know,
I truly, like,

413
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,998
think you're the most,
like, genuine

414
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,709
and, like, beautiful...
- No, you... believe me.

415
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,535
- You're fine.
- No, like...

416
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,736
No, I'm not trying...

417
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:17,813
- Yeah.
- I just want to tell you that.

418
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,472
- Thank you. Thank you.

419
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,740
- Yeah, I can feel that

420
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,943
you're, like,
a truly genuine, like, person.

421
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,010
- Yeah.

422
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,979
I was a little disappointed.

423
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,781
This is the first conversation,

424
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,283
but he is someone

425
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:35,254
that is basically
going to be for Gabby.

426
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,924
Of course, it's disappointing,
but I know that there's

427
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,327
gonna be men where I have
amazing connections.

428
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,030
So I really hope it starts
to turn around tonight.

429
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,898
- How was today?
- It was wild.

430
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,365
- Yeah.
- That was so uncomfortable.

431
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,101
- Welcome to the life...
- I love it, yeah.

432
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,336
- Of minimal clothing.

433
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,572
- I give you girls props.
That's crazy.

434
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,173
- Well, you exude confidence.

435
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,675
- Really?
- I think so.

436
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,343
- Love that word.

437
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,045
Exude confidence.
- Exude? Yeah.

438
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,180
- So I know I kissed you
on the cheek today,

439
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,482
but I think I kind of want
to retry that.

440
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,093
- Is that okay with you?
- Yeah.

441
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,485
- Come here.

442
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:26,839
- So I'm a little unsure
about where I stand tonight.

443
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:30,343
I mean, we're open to both
exploring similar connections,

444
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,613
but I'm still trying
to find my footing.

445
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,449
- So I've travelled to almost
every state in the U. S.

446
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,150
- Really?
- I think I have, like,

447
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,552
12 or 14 left.

448
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,263
At this point, I'm just like,
I might as well

449
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,388
just do the last few.

450
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,923
- Absolutely.

451
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,360
It definitely wasn't going
the way I expected it to.

452
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,595
It really feels like
these guys are

453
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:52,298
just having friendly,
small talk conversation

454
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,866
that you could have
with your cousin.

455
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,267
- I'm a huge Harry Potter fan.

456
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,012
I listen to all the Audibles,
watch the movies.

457
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,147
I love the Audible because
the narrator is incredible.

458
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,282
And he does every character.

459
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,807
It's like, it's... it's excellent.

460
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,177
- I do feel like these guys
are holding back with me.

461
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,479
I don't know where they stand.

462
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,215
And I want to hand out
a rose tonight,

463
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,351
so someone's got
to step up their game.

464
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,453
How did you feel like
today with, like,

465
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,656
really pushing everyone
outside their comfort zone?

466
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:20,693
How do you feel?
- I felt good. Um...

467
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,261
one thing I've noticed...

468
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,663
- Yeah.
- About you.

469
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:24,830
- Oh, tell me.
- Oh, yeah.

470
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,399
I've been paying attention.
- Tell me.

471
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,000
- Very brave.

472
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,467
- I'm brave?
- I think you're brave.

473
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,870
- Why is that?
- I do.

474
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,240
Well, for you to, like,
jump back into this process?

475
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,475
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, I still believe in it.

476
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,877
That's, like, incredibly brave.

477
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,145
- Thanks.

478
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,047
- So when I get my name
called up first

479
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,049
to do a little dance
in my Speedo,

480
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,751
I figured I'll take a page out
of your book.

481
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,153
- Awesome.
- So, yeah, yeah.

482
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,521
- I like it!
- Yeah.

483
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,790
And I think we did have
a nice connection as well.

484
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,067
- Yeah.
- I want to see more of it.

485
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:55,695
- I do too.
I'm really glad you're here.

486
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,477
And not a bad kisser, either.

487
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,554
- You don't think so, huh?

488
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,013
- It's more brownie points.

489
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,881
My night had been disappointing,

490
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,484
but I think Logan
turned things around.

491
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,186
He is really funny.

492
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,655
He really put himself
out there today.

493
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,057
We have really fun banter,

494
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:27,493
and he's very cute.

495
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,162
So... we'll see.

496
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,231
I really like Logan.

497
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:36,102
- That's one thing that I
really was drawn to about you,

498
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,070
was, um...

499
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:41,107
like, you're someone who makes
people smile and laugh,

500
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,476
but there's, like,
a whole ocean under that.

501
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,810
- Yeah.

502
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:47,113
- I just want to say, like,
I do recognize that.

503
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,715
- I feel like you've been,
like, really sweet to me.

504
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,016
- Really?
- Yeah.

505
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,084
- Can I kiss you?

506
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,753
- Yeah.

507
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:03,529
Logan and I had
a really good conversation.

508
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:08,534
He's super fun, very charming,
so I think I could

509
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,137
definitely see myself
giving him a rose.

510
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,439
- I'm kind of nervous
about the two roses there,

511
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:14,440
a little bit.

512
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,442
- Yeah.
There's two girls.

513
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:19,078
- There's has to be a point
in this where they're

514
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,746
both gonna like the same person.

515
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:24,550
- Yeah, things will get messy.
I have no doubt about it.

516
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,153
- Right now,
who would your rose go to?

517
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,821
- Yeah, I don't know.

518
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:32,258
Logan and I had, like,
good banter and, like,

519
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,026
kind of easy connection,
and he was like...

520
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,728
- He's a cool guy.
- Yeah.

521
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,430
- Um... I do have to tell you
something.

522
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,499
- What?
- I kissed Logan.

523
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:43,903
- Okay. Do you like him?
- I do.

524
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,472
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

525
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:47,840
Like, kind of your type?

526
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,187
- He's sweet. Yeah, I do.
- Yeah.

527
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,276
- I like him.

528
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,610
- Yeah.

529
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,580
You know, my heart
kind of dropped a little bit.

530
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,517
I think that Logan
is exploring both sides,

531
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:00,786
which is what we're asking
of the men,

532
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:03,956
but I already felt like I had
a really strong connection

533
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:06,025
with him, and I was excited
to see where things go.

534
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,693
So it feels weird.

535
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,528
- I just... I want to get

536
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,530
where your head's at too.
- Yeah.

537
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:13,208
- Because if he's someone
you're like, super,

538
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:16,535
super interested in, like,
I will completely be like...

539
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,437
you know?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

540
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,705
Yeah.

541
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,610
Yeah.
- Hmm.

542
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,979
- It is a weird place
for Rachel and I right now.

543
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,190
You know, we're both exploring

544
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,982
both sides of our relationships.

545
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,617
- Hello.

546
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,285
- Ladies.
- Hi.

547
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,622
Everything's just way harder
than I expected.

548
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,390
And this is, like,
kind of the first time

549
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:39,758
we're figuring it out.

550
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:43,429
Tonight, I want to give
this rose to someone

551
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:49,201
who made me feel really special
and made me laugh.

552
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:52,271
Logan, will you accept
this rose?

553
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:54,240
- I will. Thank you.

554
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:57,142
Okay,
I'm not sure how to pin it on.

555
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,014
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

556
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,484
- Rose looks good on you, kid.

557
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:08,621
- Yeah, I know today
was such a crazy day,

558
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:12,057
and I've loved getting to know
each and every one of you

559
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:15,461
tonight, but I'm gonna give
this rose

560
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,730
to someone
who surprised me tonight.

561
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,265
So...

562
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,966
Johnny,
will you accept this rose?

563
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,234
- Of course I will.

564
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,538
- Rachel feels very strongly
about Logan.

565
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,874
I want to be able
to give her that space

566
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,743
in order to nurture.

567
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,978
It's truly not worth stepping
on Rachel's toes

568
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,179
in this scenario.

569
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,814
- Thanks for being our first

570
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,549
date night.
- Yeah.

571
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,785
- Two Bachelorettes
is causing some hurdles

572
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,221
that we didn't really know
to even plan for,

573
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:44,857
and I'm not sure how we're
gonna figure it out.

574
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,796
- Gentlemen, how we doing?
What's going on?

575
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:53,766
Hey! We doing all right?
Good to see you. All right.

576
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,432
Well, listen, guys,
some of you gentlemen

577
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,603
got roses last night, right?

578
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,738
Logan, Johnny.
- That's right, yeah.

579
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,349
- Congratulations, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

580
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,684
- All right,
so here's the fun part.

581
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:05,511
For the rest of this week,
both Gabby and Rachel

582
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,681
will each have
a one-on-one date.

583
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,050
Now, obviously,
only two dates left this week,

584
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,852
so that means time
is at a premium.

585
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,021
Okay, on that note,

586
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,723
got the first date card
right here.

587
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:23,062
- Wow.
- This one's from Rachel.

588
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,406
Gentlemen,
I wish you all the best

589
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,365
and hope to see you
at the next Rose Ceremony.

590
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,101
If there is one... I don't even
know at this point.

591
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,369
See you guys. Good luck.

592
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:31,937
See you, Jesse.

593
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:33,505
- I'm very excited

594
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,541
for the possibility of a date
with Rachel.

595
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,410
Rachel is so beautiful.
Like, she's the real deal.

596
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,813
My heart is beating
out of my chest.

597
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,515
- I'm just crossing my fingers.

598
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,652
I'm like, "Please, please,
like, just say my name."

599
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,556
- Jordan V.

600
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:51,890
- Wasn't my name.

601
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:55,327
- "Love is in the air.
Love, Rachel."

602
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:01,743
- Coming into this,
you don't know what to expect,

603
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:04,236
and I definitely didn't expect
to get the first one-on-one.

604
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:07,706
But now that I got it,
I'm elated.

605
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:10,876
And I'm super grateful
that she sees something in me.

606
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,053
I came here for love, you know.

607
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,512
I came here to find the person

608
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,156
I'm supposed to spend
the rest of my life with.

609
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,783
The beginning of forever
could start today.

610
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:23,055
- We have a cool car.
- Ooh, look at that.

611
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,403
- I figured it was fitting.
- I love it. That's beautiful.

612
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,127
- Last night,
I was very concerned

613
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,797
that no one wants me,
but it ended up being great.

614
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,232
- That is awesome.
- Convertible?

615
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:36,201
Today, my greatest hopes
are having

616
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,270
a really good connection
with Jordan.

617
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:40,205
I'm driving, though.
- Absolutely.

618
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,649
I wouldn't expect
anything different.

619
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,209
- He told me that
he was here to meet me,

620
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,412
which is a really good feeling.

621
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:47,913
I couldn't let you drive.
I know.

622
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,581
- You drive every day.
- I know.

623
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,717
- Something I noticed right
away was how passionate

624
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:54,553
Jordan is about his career
in race car driving.

625
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,089
Yeah, the stakes are high today.

626
00:25:57,156 --> 00:26:00,025
There's going to be a rose,
so it's a big deal.

627
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,293
Lot of pressure.

628
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,862
Just kidding, Jordan.
You'll do fine.

629
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,130
- We're haulin'.

630
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,932
Give it a little bit.
Give it a little bit.

631
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,767
- Whoo!
- Yeah, give it a little bit.

632
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:09,935
Yeah, throw the hands up.

633
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,370
Whoo!

634
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,539
I'm like,
blinded by my long hair.

635
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,374
- I feel like I want
to hold it for you,

636
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,876
but I don't know if I should
do that or not.

637
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,946
- I have something really fun
planned for Jordan today.

638
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,648
It's something that gets
your adrenaline

639
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:25,617
going a little bit,
and I'm excited

640
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:28,921
to give Jordan a little taste
of my brand of adventure.

641
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,292
- No way.

642
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,893
No way.

643
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,595
- Have you ever
done this before?

644
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,197
- No, oh, man, I'm in for it.

645
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,732
I'm in for it.
Are you kidding me?

646
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,036
- Zero gravity means you
basically get to float around

647
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,705
like an astronaut
without going to space.

648
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,149
- Starting to freak out
a little bit.

649
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,509
I am 100% nervous.

650
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,644
I'm... you know,
I'm scared of heights.

651
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,314
Zero gravity terrifies me.

652
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,986
- You get to be
in my element for a day.

653
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,588
- Holy cow.

654
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,390
Rachel, you know, her being
a pilot, she can handle it.

655
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,435
I think I would feel a little
safer if she was flying it.

656
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,828
Oh, now it's getting real.

657
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:12,231
- Boarding the plane, I am like,

658
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,966
shocked by the fact that Jordan

659
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,834
is having such a scared,

660
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,103
strong reaction because, I mean,

661
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,205
he is a race car driver.

662
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,309
- It's crazy.

663
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,613
- Is this crazy?
- Yes.

664
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,581
- Are you scared?
- Yes.

665
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:32,784
- Are you?
- No!

666
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,019
- Of course not.

667
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:35,420
Can't do the heights.

668
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,722
I can do the speed.

669
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,091
And I feel a little nervous,
obviously,

670
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,126
but she's gonna be
right by my side,

671
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,728
and I can't wait
to share it with her.

672
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:48,466
- Oh, my God!

673
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,705
Oh, my God.
- I got you.

674
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:54,806
- You got me?

675
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,643
- Oh!

676
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:58,911
You're stronger than me!

677
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:04,816
How did you do that?

678
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,718
- I don't even know,
I don't know how to stop.

679
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,353
Heights make me nervous.

680
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,589
If I was alone,
I would be terrified,

681
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,724
but Rachel and her
calming ability,

682
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:16,028
it helped... it is helping
calm my nerves.

683
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,996
- Are you feeling sick?
Are you all right?

684
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,064
- No, I'm good, yeah.

685
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:20,699
I did forget about
the world today,

686
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:23,302
and I was just super grateful
to her for choosing me to be

687
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,138
on this date with her and have
this experience with her.

688
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,549
So yeah,
I forgot about everything.

689
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:28,783
I didn't care about the guys
in the house.

690
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,409
I didn't care about
anything at all

691
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,178
but spending time with her
and having this experience.

692
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,227
I think today,
up in zero gravity,

693
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,596
we really,
really found a connection.

694
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,531
I feel only excitement
for tonight.

695
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,399
And now it's just time to build

696
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:55,867
on what we have already.

697
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,875
- So who here has spent time
with my girl so far?

698
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,143
I have not.

699
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,980
- Which one is your girl?
- Which one is your girl?

700
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,683
- I'm honestly open
to both of them.

701
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,686
I'm, like, rubbing my hands
together at the opportunity

702
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,522
to, like, get some
one-on-one time for sure.

703
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,625
Because I plan to be here
all the way.

704
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,760
But ultimately, like,
there's definitely

705
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,738
some deal breakers for me,
like, especially if I'm talking

706
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,999
about one person who I would
spend the rest of my life with.

707
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,834
Like, for me,
it would be a deal breaker

708
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,936
if we got down
to the final four,

709
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:33,739
which I plan to be in,
and we go into

710
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,907
Fantasy Suite and we have
this sexual experience,

711
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,944
and then the person
who I'm most interested in

712
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,646
decides that she's
gonna have sex

713
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,681
with multiple people
and feel it out.

714
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:45,450
That would be the situation
where I'd go, "Okay, I'm out."

715
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,852
There's no chance.

716
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,086
- Whoa.

717
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,530
What are you talking about?

718
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,790
I really don't think that
we should be talking about

719
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,392
Fantasy Suites at all
at this point.

720
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,036
I think it's a little weird
that Chris is thinking

721
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,194
that far ahead.

722
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,301
It's a little presumptuous

723
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,197
and disrespectful
to Gabby and Rachel.

724
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,832
- You're kind of talking
about something

725
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:01,967
that is way down the line.

726
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:03,278
- Yeah, this
is a long time away.

727
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,903
- We kind of need to focus on

728
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,538
what's in front of us right now.

729
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,173
- Chris is bringing up
Fantasy Suites.

730
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,142
It's kind of a jerk-y move.

731
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,879
I'm sure he's gonna cause
a wildfire of.

732
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,362
Wow.

733
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:31,963
- Isn't this gorgeous?

734
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,399
- This is absolutely gorgeous.

735
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:37,502
- I truly had
such an incredible day.

736
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:41,707
Jordan, I think, was the
perfect choice for this date.

737
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,308
Thank you.

738
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:47,245
Tonight, I'm really excited
to get to know Jordan more.

739
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,681
I mean, we have
a playful chemistry,

740
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:51,917
and I want to see if
it can go further than that.

741
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,352
I'm really hopeful.

742
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,754
I, of course,
love the fact that we got

743
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:59,191
to experience something
for the first time together.

744
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,761
We do have such
different passions,

745
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:05,030
but in a way, it's so similar.

746
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:07,399
And I think for me,
that's been something

747
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,901
that's been hard for me
to find in a partner.

748
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,637
Someone who shares, like,
a passion,

749
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,774
and I noticed that with you
right away.

750
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:18,076
- It's been hard to explain
what I do to most people

751
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:20,712
'cause most people
don't know what I do.

752
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:23,048
They hear "drag racing,"
they have no idea.

753
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:25,117
The fact that, you know,
you're a pilot,

754
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,586
and the fact that
you understand that feeling

755
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,187
that we get before we fly

756
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,722
or before we drive...
- Mm-hmm.

757
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:33,291
- It's a little, you know,
easier to explain to you

758
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:35,627
'cause I know you get it
and you get me.

759
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,462
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

760
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,266
- You know,
I'm cool with everybody here,

761
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,270
but there are some people,
you know,

762
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:46,614
even here, I feel like Chris,
you know,

763
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,216
you'll say, like,
subtle things, you know.

764
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,384
- Like what?
- You'll say, like,

765
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,518
subtle things
in a group environment.

766
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:51,643
- Like what?

767
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:57,315
- You spoke on, like,
a fantasy room subject.

768
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:00,685
- A what? Be clear.
What did I say?

769
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,954
- It was about,
if you're not first

770
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:06,425
in that fantasy room,
and you're last...

771
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,535
- You wouldn't want to be there?

772
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,927
- Yeah.

773
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:11,763
- My personal perspective,
and I hold true to this, is,

774
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,533
if you're in a situation
where there's four people,

775
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,768
and there's four people invited
to this Fantasy Suite,

776
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:19,070
and the female in this situation

777
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:22,707
has sex with someone else,
I wouldn't be interested

778
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,676
in that person
being the person I'm with.

779
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,711
- Okay, I have a question,
because this is

780
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,814
what kind of happened
last season.

781
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,417
Would you be...
Would you vocalize that to them

782
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,152
before Fantasy Suites,

783
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:36,588
during Fantasy Suites,
or after Fantasy Suites?

784
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,800
- Good question; it would be
dependent on the situation.

785
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,301
Because something that's also...
- Well, you wouldn't know

786
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,436
the situation...
- Listen, listen, listen.

787
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,470
- You wouldn't know
the situation.

788
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,129
- Let me finish speaking,
please.

789
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:46,598
For me, what I'm
not interested in

790
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:49,568
is you guys' way
of going about this process.

791
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,205
- When you talk about
Fantasy Suites,

792
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,675
you're there
because you're in love.

793
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,019
- When you're at Fantasy Suites,

794
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,845
you're there because
you're in the final four.

795
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,713
That's the only guarantee.
- So it's a game?

796
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,615
- If you're there,
then that's a game.

797
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:05,092
That's a game to you.
- That's a game, dude.

798
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,519
- Ah, gosh darn it,
I did not say that.

799
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:08,629
Like, I did not even
use the term...

800
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,688
- Didn't he?

801
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,056
- May I speak to you?
Look at me.

802
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,190
Look at me.

803
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:14,025
- Why are you telling me,
you're really,

804
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,161
like, allowing someone
to speak like

805
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:19,064
you have this, like,
this... this approach?

806
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,832
- Of organization?

807
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:22,376
- No, you're trying
to control it, though.

808
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,703
- So I've let you speak.
I've let him speak.

809
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,147
- I'm just saying the way
you saying it

810
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,439
is still rubbing us wrong.

811
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,441
- It's rubbing you wrong.

812
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:33,011
- The way Chris speaks
is all about control.

813
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:34,646
He's very kind of intense.

814
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:37,616
Maybe you don't mean to deliver
a condescending tone,

815
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,784
but in general, that's
what it sounds like to people.

816
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,020
He's drawing a lot of lines
in the sand that

817
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,955
kind of surprised
a lot of the guys.

818
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,992
- Any time that you have
a premeditated thought of,

819
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,160
"You won't do this,
unless that,"

820
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:52,030
that is a form of control,
and that is manipulative.

821
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:53,965
This could be our queen,
this could be

822
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,101
the mother of our children,
and this could be

823
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,969
someone we spend the rest
of our lives with.

824
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,839
You cannot have preconditions
to love.

825
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:03,174
It's just the form of control
that a lot of men just

826
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:06,311
don't realize that they do
that damages good women.

827
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:13,385
- Well, I would love
to know more about your family.

828
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,829
You kind of mentioned
your siblings.

829
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:16,187
- Yeah. Okay.

830
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:20,759
Yeah, so, um,
I have a younger brother.

831
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,127
- Mm-hmm.

832
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,237
- And then I have
a younger sister.

833
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:24,262
Her name is Morgan.

834
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,931
She is 22, I believe, right now.

835
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,032
- Okay.

836
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,733
- And yeah, you know,
just growing up,

837
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,937
being the older brother,
we went through

838
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,705
a tough situation
when we were younger.

839
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:34,873
I mean...

840
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:40,812
My parents got divorced
when I was 13 years old.

841
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,448
A lot of things
kind of went through me.

842
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:46,318
I had to kind of take care of
my little brother and sister.

843
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:47,485
- Yeah, how was that?

844
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,654
- A lot of communication
ran through me.

845
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:50,956
- Oh, wow.

846
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:54,225
- And it forced me to grow up
really quickly

847
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,895
'cause I used to take pride
in them being together.

848
00:34:56,962 --> 00:35:00,398
Like, I really, really enjoyed
having a family unit.

849
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,733
- Mm-hmm.

850
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,336
- And yeah, family
is super important to me.

851
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,804
Not only that, I mean...

852
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,750
And that taught me a lot
of life lessons like...

853
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,444
Things aren't always gonna go
as planned,

854
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,012
and that's okay.

855
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,415
And you just have to pick up
the pieces and become stronger.

856
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,619
So that's just a little more
insight into why I am

857
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:21,685
the way I am.

858
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,121
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

859
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,660
- Jordan, he is so perfect.

860
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:31,062
He's exactly
what I've asked for,

861
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,697
and he's here for me.

862
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,766
He's being honest.

863
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,969
But the more the day
is progressing,

864
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:41,773
the more I just know that
there is something missing.

865
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,509
And the more I feel it,
the more I'm pushing it down.

866
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,912
- Yeah.
- Well, this truly means

867
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,748
so much to me,
that you were able

868
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:54,319
to feel comfortable enough
to share all of this with me.

869
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:58,289
- Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.

870
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,525
- Okay.
- Sorry, just a minute.

871
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,761
- You're good. You're good.
You're good.

872
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,277
- I feel really bad.

873
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:25,550
I'm just trying to...
I don't know.

874
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:29,220
It's hard because I don't know.

875
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:33,658
And I want to know. I don't.
- About him?

876
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,378
- Kind of curious,
he's been gone all day.

877
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,837
His bags are still here.

878
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:48,940
I guess there's a connection
between him and Rachel.

879
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,044
- Someone's here.
Let me get the door.

880
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,946
- I can't go wrong
with either lady.

881
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:58,416
I definitely want one-on-one
time with one of these girls.

882
00:36:58,483 --> 00:36:59,960
Like, I wanna to take every
opportunity and try

883
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,629
to make these girls laugh,
try and make them smile,

884
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:04,155
try to really just stand out
from the pack.

885
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,825
- Hey, boys, we got a date card.

886
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,727
- The hard part for me
is, you know,

887
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,563
I want a date card
that every other guy wants.

888
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:26,878
- "Nate, meet me at my place.

889
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:31,282
Love, Gabby.
PS, bring a bathing suit."

890
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,723
- Good job, good job.

891
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,359
- It literally feels like
I just won the lottery.

892
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:44,662
Let's go. Let's go!

893
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:45,864
- You better smile.

894
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,132
You better be smiling, dawg.

895
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,366
- No, like, I'm so shocked.

896
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,535
I'm happy for sure.
- You better be happy.

897
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,002
- Yeah, I'm happy,
but I'm like, no,

898
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,371
I'm like, I'm legit shocked.

899
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,149
Like, I literally thought
my name was, like,

900
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:57,175
the last name
that was gonna be called.

901
00:37:57,242 --> 00:38:00,145
But like, I'm genuinely happy,
like...

902
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,448
I feel like I could run
through a wall right now.

903
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:07,619
Whew.
Get to be Gabby's first date.

904
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:10,588
I just can't believe it.
This is crazy.

905
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:19,197
- How are you feeling?

906
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:21,332
- I feel really bad.
- About him?

907
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,370
I guess I'm just confused.

908
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,571
- That's okay.

909
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,649
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay, it's okay.

910
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,218
Everything okay?

911
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,853
- Yeah.
- Okay.

912
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,328
Okay.

913
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,696
Um...

914
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:35,240
I truly could not have asked
for a better person

915
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,976
to spend
this incredible day with.

916
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,413
But...

917
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:50,655
There is just something
that is missing for me tonight.

918
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,492
And for that reason,
I don't want

919
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:00,098
to bring you into next week,
knowing that I don't know

920
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,367
if I can truly
get there with you,

921
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,769
and I just really want
to be honest.

922
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:07,605
And for that, I am sorry.

923
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:09,274
But for that reason,
I can't give you

924
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,043
this rose,
and I do truly apologize,

925
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,246
because you are
absolutely incredible.

926
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:16,915
I can't tell you enough.

927
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,220
Am I able to walk you out?
- Yeah, absolutely.

928
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,659
I'm so sorry.

929
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,961
- It's okay.
- It's okay, it's okay.

930
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:32,597
I understand. It's...

931
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:35,233
- I feel horrible.

932
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,503
And I also feel guilty because
this is my first one-on-one

933
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,438
as the Bachelorette,
and I want it

934
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,349
to be so perfect and it's such
an amazing night,

935
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,842
but there's something
I can't shake.

936
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,778
- One last hug.
- Of course.

937
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,112
- Thank you, I... it's okay.

938
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,515
I appreciate everything, okay?

939
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:54,285
- And I had such
an incredible day planned out

940
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:56,754
for my first one-on-one,
ending the night

941
00:40:56,821 --> 00:41:01,492
with a private concert from
Ashley Cooke and Brett Young.

942
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,529
But it just wasn't meant to be.

943
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:18,736
- I feel a lot of pressure
as the Bachelorette.

944
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:21,839
If this first one-on-one
isn't working,

945
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,208
that I'm failing in the role.

946
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:29,080
It's hard
because I really want to be

947
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:31,849
the best Bachelorette
for these guys, too,

948
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,551
and I just don't want them
to feel like

949
00:42:33,618 --> 00:42:35,420
I'm failing them either.

950
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,758
- Oh.

951
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,126
- Yo, what are they doing?

952
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:44,695
- He's holding his bag up?
- They grabbed his bags?

953
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,824
- I didn't ever expect
to be Bachelorette.

954
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,625
And so it's just hard to, like,

955
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:15,960
really feel like I deserve it

956
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:18,563
'cause I never feel like I did.

957
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:19,940
I don't want to be
Rachel the Bachelorette,

958
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:21,332
I just want to be Rachel.

959
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:34,912
- How was your night?

960
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,981
How, like, how are you
feeling this morning?

961
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:39,383
- Last night,
I just kind of realized,

962
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:44,088
like, I just don't see Jordan
as my future husband.

963
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:45,790
And I think
it's so hard to, like,

964
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:49,060
be really honest with yourself,
especially when Jordan

965
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,062
was someone
I was so excited about.

966
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,497
- Yeah.
- And I mean, he is great.

967
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:55,099
It's just so confusing.

968
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:58,503
- I'm actually
really scared, like...

969
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,104
I don't know.
- Right.

970
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:01,448
- I mean, even with Nate,
I'm, like,

971
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,740
super attracted to him.

972
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,575
I think he's really fun,
but I'm like,

973
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,577
what if the same thing
happens to me?

974
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,779
- You know that
you're attracted to Nate

975
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:10,314
and you want
to see where it goes.

976
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,150
Trust yourself
and be 100% honest.

977
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:13,951
- Yeah.

978
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,520
That's good advice.

979
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,689
- I just really hope that
these guys know we're, like,

980
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:19,991
taking it seriously,

981
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:21,926
'cause I'm sure
they were all shocked too.

982
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,504
- Yeah, that's what
I was thinking of too.

983
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:26,164
I'm like, "Damn, I bet
they know we mean business."

984
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,231
- Yeah.

985
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:31,769
- I was so sure that Jordan
was gonna come back.

986
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,372
- No, like, we all
looked over and like,

987
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:36,007
next thing we know,
his bags are gone.

988
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,475
So it's just like,

989
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:40,778
it was just a trip that, like,
it happened that quick.

990
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,481
We'll see what happens today
with Nate.

991
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:44,548
- Yeah.

992
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,686
- Jordan V got sent home.

993
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:50,388
I did not see that happening.

994
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:52,857
I could be in the same boat

995
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:55,826
since I'm Gabby's
first one-on-one.

996
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:58,329
You never know,
so I'm going to dig in

997
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,331
and just show her who I am.

998
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:03,634
And the biggest part of me
is my daughter, you know,

999
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,937
so I'm probably gonna share
with her that, you know,

1000
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,574
I'm a father of the most
amazing baby girl in the world.

1001
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:12,276
I miss her a lot.

1002
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,918
I love that girl so much.

1003
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,664
I think she understands
why I'm here,

1004
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:25,656
and she's happy for me.

1005
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,595
Oh, my gosh,
this place is so cool.

1006
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:31,872
This person could be the person

1007
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,331
I spend the rest
of my life with.

1008
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:37,201
Like, I have the chance
to realize my wife today.

1009
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:40,271
- Hi!
- Hey!

1010
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:41,615
- How are you?
- I got you, girl.

1011
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:44,475
You did... oh! Thank you.

1012
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:45,476
Oh, my gosh,
it's so good to see you.

1013
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:46,687
- Oh, my gosh.
You look so good.

1014
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:48,713
Thank you, so do you.
Are you excited?

1015
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,414
- I am so excited for today.

1016
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,083
- Me too. Come in.

1017
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,486
- Is this your place?
- Yes.

1018
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:57,021
Should we get some champagne?

1019
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,389
- Yeah, absolutely.

1020
00:45:58,456 --> 00:45:59,657
- Hello.

1021
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:03,070
- We're gonna have some
champagne, do you want some?

1022
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,595
- Oh, my gosh, maybe.

1023
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:05,830
- Yeah!
- I guess.

1024
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,174
What do you think
about our place?

1025
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:08,799
- I love it, you know, I...

1026
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:12,036
I think the favorite part
is everything, you know?

1027
00:46:13,638 --> 00:46:15,940
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1028
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:17,908
- Yeah, it's my first date.

1029
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,710
- To you.
- To you.

1030
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,013
- To us.
- Yeah.

1031
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,948
- Watching Gabby and Nate,
you can tell

1032
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:26,284
that there is a connection
and a spark,

1033
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,586
and it's not forced at all.

1034
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:29,997
Even just the way
she looks at him.

1035
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:32,623
It's just completely different
than how I felt

1036
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,525
yesterday with Jordan.

1037
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:36,794
Of course, I would have
liked mine to go

1038
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:40,731
that way as well, but it is
good to see that Gabby's happy.

1039
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,400
- Thank you for coming today.

1040
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,801
Oh, no, thank you
for inviting me.

1041
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:48,272
Like, my... my heart dropped
whenever they said my name.

1042
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:49,683
I kind of blacked out
for a minute.

1043
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:50,908
Did you?

1044
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,244
- I just really wanted
to make an impression

1045
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,579
because I feel like
I do care about you

1046
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,015
and a lot of who you are
resonates with me.

1047
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,324
Oh, my God,
my first kiss with Gabby.

1048
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,758
It was magical.

1049
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,027
Like, her lips are so soft.

1050
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:14,198
I... I knew she was
a good kisser, but damn.

1051
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,739
There's our ride.

1052
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:25,009
- Stop it.
- Yeah.

1053
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:27,845
- Helicopter came out of
the sky and my jaw just drops,

1054
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:30,715
I'm like, this is so cool.

1055
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:32,450
- Oh, thank you.

1056
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:37,688
- Oh, this is so cool.

1057
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:44,528
This is the best day ever!

1058
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:48,032
Oh, God.

1059
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:49,767
- It is so beautiful.

1060
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:51,369
- Oh, this is amazing.

1061
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:57,308
Holy!

1062
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,143
- Son of a gun.

1063
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,045
- Bye.
- All right, bye, guys.

1064
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:02,380
- Is he waving at us?

1065
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:05,282
- I'm sorry, but not sorry.

1066
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:06,851
Yeah.

1067
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,252
- That was not fun to watch.

1068
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,754
They're rubbin' it in our face.

1069
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,389
Only we're having a good time.

1070
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:14,291
Yeah.

1071
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:15,893
- This is cool.
- Yeah.

1072
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,361
- How are you
with roller coasters?

1073
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:19,096
- I do roller coasters
just fine.

1074
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:22,666
Except for being afraid.

1075
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,777
- Except for being terrified.

1076
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:25,636
- Yeah, but, like,
would rather be

1077
00:48:25,703 --> 00:48:28,172
on a roller coaster
than, like, skydiving.

1078
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,408
- Oh, ten times out of ten.

1079
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:32,042
Whoa!
- Whoa!

1080
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:35,246
- Oh, man.
- Whoa!

1081
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,783
- He was doing backflips,
and we were like "Ahh!"

1082
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,489
In the helicopter,
it seems like I can see

1083
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:42,987
the entire world,
but I found myself looking

1084
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:46,157
inside the cabin at the hottie
to right most of the time.

1085
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,858
- Oh, oh!

1086
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,827
- Oh, this is awesome.

1087
00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:51,128
- It really is.

1088
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:58,836
Flying on the helicopter
with Nate was really romantic.

1089
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:00,671
I really feel
like I'm on a first date

1090
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:02,973
with the guy I'm super into.

1091
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,709
- This is easily
the best date ever.

1092
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,211
Yeah.

1093
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:11,558
Oh, oh, wait, are we...
- Oh, are we stopping?

1094
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:13,117
- Oh, we're landing
on something.

1095
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:14,585
- What?

1096
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:16,487
Oh, my gosh, this is awesome.

1097
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,327
- This is our hot tub.

1098
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,262
- Oh, my gosh,
this looks so cool.

1099
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,907
Oh, we got champagne there too.
- Look how cute it is!

1100
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:28,699
Yeah!
- Look at this.

1101
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:29,700
I'll step down.
- It's the perfect size.

1102
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:31,135
Oh, thank you.

1103
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:32,570
Did you bring your Speedo?

1104
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,906
- Gabby looks so good today.

1105
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,541
I can easily say, like, I've...

1106
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:40,277
I've never had
the chemistry, you know,

1107
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,680
kick off so well, so early.

1108
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,982
Her smile is so radiant,
and her personality

1109
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:47,084
just makes it shine even more.

1110
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,085
- How old are you?

1111
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:50,521
You seem so mature.
- 33.

1112
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:53,424
I'm 33.
- I've never met a mature man.

1113
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:54,771
- I've never met a mature woman.

1114
00:49:57,862 --> 00:50:01,398
I love your voices,
I do them all the time too.

1115
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,234
It's cool,
but no, I could just...

1116
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,878
It's one of those things...
Like, I could sense

1117
00:50:04,902 --> 00:50:06,470
that you are very mature.

1118
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:08,472
I know that, you know,
you're funny and goofy,

1119
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:09,716
but there's a deeper side to you

1120
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:10,841
that is serious

1121
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:12,209
when you need to be.
- Yeah.

1122
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:13,753
- You just make me
feel good around you,

1123
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:16,347
and I just want to be,
like, around you more.

1124
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,953
For a first date
to be this good,

1125
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,722
like, it's kind
of setting the bar.

1126
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,666
I just kind of just want
to keep getting to know her

1127
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,890
because there's so many levels

1128
00:50:27,925 --> 00:50:30,261
to her that it's just beautiful.

1129
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:31,795
- This has been really good.

1130
00:50:33,898 --> 00:50:36,333
- She just has a way of
bringing out the best in me,

1131
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,869
and I just like
who I am around her.

1132
00:50:38,936 --> 00:50:40,113
And I think there's
something there,

1133
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,506
so hopefully
tonight ends with me

1134
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:44,275
getting to continue
this journey.

1135
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,449
- Nate has been
gone a long time.

1136
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:53,817
I feel like so far this date's

1137
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,844
a little bit longer
than maybe Jordan's yesterday.

1138
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,855
- I thought there was about
a 95% chance

1139
00:50:57,922 --> 00:50:59,990
Jordan came back, and he didn't.

1140
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,659
- It was definitely
shocking that he

1141
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,736
did not walk through that door.

1142
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,760
- Absolutely.

1143
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:05,863
- I mean, and then
now we have Nate

1144
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,498
on his first one-on-one
with Gabby,

1145
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:08,866
so it's...

1146
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:10,477
- What could happen there,
and that's the thing too.

1147
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:13,370
I... I in my head,
am just thinking to myself,

1148
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:15,072
those bags could
honestly leave too.

1149
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:18,042
- I don't...
I guess we'll uh, we'll see.

1150
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:19,108
- We will see.

1151
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:31,655
- Thank you.

1152
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:33,891
I think today has really
showed me that

1153
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,960
Nate has great character.

1154
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,228
He's so easy
and fun to be around.

1155
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:41,765
I don't think I've ever
dated someone quite like him.

1156
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,968
That's sweet, thank you.

1157
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:45,469
I know there's a lot more to him

1158
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:47,705
and I'm just getting
the beginning.

1159
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,907
It's just been
so fun to really, like,

1160
00:51:49,974 --> 00:51:52,376
peel back the layers
and get to know him.

1161
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,645
I'm so glad that you came today.

1162
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:56,714
It was just fun.
It felt like I genuinely

1163
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,482
hung out with someone
that I've known

1164
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:00,351
for longer than,
you know, three days.

1165
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:01,485
- Yeah, totally.

1166
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:03,087
- You know, like,
such a familiar soul,

1167
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:06,256
and I think it's 'cause
we're similar in a lot of ways,

1168
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:07,334
and I know we still have a lot

1169
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:08,568
to get to know about each other.

1170
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:10,561
But I like how this is starting.

1171
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:11,695
I really do.
- Yeah.

1172
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:14,632
I think immediately,
I felt something.

1173
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:16,767
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Intrigue, a connection.

1174
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:19,403
- It was... it was funny
whenever you were like,

1175
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,939
we're just gonna chill
in the house because, you know,

1176
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:24,508
it could have been that or
the most extravagant of dates.

1177
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:26,610
Like, granted, I loved it.
- Yeah, totally.

1178
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:28,312
Yeah.

1179
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:30,247
I prefer the helicopter.
- Yeah.

1180
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,515
I prefer the helicopter.

1181
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:33,584
- Yeah.

1182
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:34,985
- Oh, my God.

1183
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:39,189
Oh, my goodness.

1184
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:42,026
No, but there is one thing
that I do want to...

1185
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,828
To tell you about,
so the biggest part of me

1186
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:47,364
that I really haven't discussed

1187
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:50,668
thus far is, I am a father,

1188
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:54,805
and I have a beautiful
baby girl who is six.

1189
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:57,941
- Aww.
- And she is... she is my world.

1190
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,711
Like, a pocket of my heart
just... just burst open

1191
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,646
the first time,
you know, she said, "Dad,"

1192
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:05,516
or the first time she told me
she loved me the first time,

1193
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:08,719
like, I felt her...
Her hug me, like, it's...

1194
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:11,255
It's just I'm...
I'm a girl dad, 1,000%.

1195
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:13,057
- You're gonna make me cry.

1196
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:15,259
So sweet.
- Oh, thank you.

1197
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:18,062
Please don't make me cry,
oh, my gosh.

1198
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:19,496
- What's she like?

1199
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:24,268
She is... she's like
the human form of coffee.

1200
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:28,172
She's, um, I don't know.

1201
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:29,716
She's like a little me,
for the most part.

1202
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,442
- Aww.
- I love her a lot.

1203
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:33,243
- Yeah, no, that's so sweet.

1204
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,112
I'm actually
really close with my dad.

1205
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:39,283
- Really.
- And he... just 'cause...

1206
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,052
I think he's always
wanted to be a dad too.

1207
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,487
- Mm-hmm.

1208
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:45,322
- And I feel like sometimes,
you know,

1209
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,457
with parents and stuff,

1210
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,058
you feel like
you have a calling.

1211
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:50,661
It was definitely his
to be a dad, and he always,

1212
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:53,263
like, had a huge presence
in my life, so...

1213
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,065
- That's amazing.

1214
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:57,267
- I'm not really close
with my mom.

1215
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:00,037
I think that is a lot
of the reason why I am

1216
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:01,405
who I am today.
- Mm-hmm.

1217
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:03,373
- But I had to be really
self-sufficient

1218
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,177
and independent and relearn
what it was to be loved

1219
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,847
'cause I didn't totally
get it as a child.

1220
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:13,283
So for you to, like,
step up and want to give that

1221
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,687
to your daughter is amazing,
and it's the best thing

1222
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,289
that is ever gonna happen
to her.

1223
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:22,126
When Nate told me
that he was a father,

1224
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,194
I started to think,
"Am I there yet?

1225
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,395
"Can I be a mother?

1226
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:27,464
Is this a life I want?"

1227
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:29,900
But I don't have
to make that decision

1228
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:32,402
right now,
and I feel like it does

1229
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:35,839
bring me closer to him,
just knowing that he

1230
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:38,742
feels comfortable
telling me all of these things.

1231
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:40,077
- I really do see, like,

1232
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:42,279
that I can have
a potential future with you

1233
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:44,148
and a potential for love.

1234
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,250
Meeting you has been one

1235
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:48,185
of the greatest days
and moments, you know,

1236
00:54:48,252 --> 00:54:49,292
that I could have...
- Aww.

1237
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:50,563
- That I could have
gone through.

1238
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,031
So I appreciate you.
- Oh, my gosh, thank you.

1239
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,900
- I genuinely appreciate
who you are as a person.

1240
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:55,325
- Yeah.

1241
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,531
- I just want to say

1242
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,299
I didn't know what to expect,

1243
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:03,409
you know, bringing you here.

1244
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,536
I had a really good feeling.

1245
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:07,437
Listening to you speak
about your daughter,

1246
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:11,375
watching you be able
to give this unconditional love

1247
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:15,345
that's gonna go with her
forever is, like, really

1248
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,481
the best thing I could ask for
in a partner.

1249
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,117
Nate...

1250
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:23,954
Will you accept this rose?

1251
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:25,656
- Absolutely.

1252
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,427
Perfect, just perfect.

1253
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:34,865
- Giving Nate my first
one-on-one date rose,

1254
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:37,467
it feels so good to be able
to let him know

1255
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:39,436
that I appreciate him.

1256
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:42,172
Hearing his story
about his daughter,

1257
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:47,144
I know if I were to ever become
a mother, like, it would...

1258
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:49,746
It would be, like,
so hard, I think,

1259
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:52,883
'cause I feel like you would
just love it so much.

1260
00:55:54,218 --> 00:55:55,986
I think I've been
afraid to be a mom

1261
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:59,223
sometimes because I think
it would hurt too bad.

1262
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,458
- And we spin.
- Oh, can you dance actually?

1263
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:04,828
- And then you are... yeah.
- Aw.

1264
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:08,665
He gives me the confidence
to not be so scared.

1265
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:12,769
Some people have
the ability to love greater

1266
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:14,872
or maybe feel things more.

1267
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:19,076
And I can just see him having
such a big capacity for love.

1268
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:28,819
It's easy to see
my life with him.

1269
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:31,688
He really is like
a true, true man.

1270
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:47,638
- I feel like tonight, you know,

1271
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:48,882
the tensions gonna be high.
- Yeah.

1272
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,440
- A lot of people
are gonna want time,

1273
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:51,718
and we'll just see how it goes.

1274
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:52,886
I don't know.
It's gonna be interesting.

1275
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,912
- If you had a choice,
who would you

1276
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,513
want to talk to first?

1277
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,260
- I'm not leaning
towards one or the other.

1278
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,586
So you know, we'll see
what happens, I don't know.

1279
00:57:02,653 --> 00:57:04,655
- Yeah.

1280
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,256
- Really waking up
this morning is...

1281
00:57:06,323 --> 00:57:07,925
Is there's a lot on my mind.

1282
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:09,593
Tonight's the cocktail party.

1283
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,704
You know, we started the week
off really, really good

1284
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,297
until Jordan had
his one-on-one date

1285
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,599
with Rachel,
and he ain't come back.

1286
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:18,402
You know, so it left some
questions in the air.

1287
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:21,538
For me, I'm just, you know,
really trying to understand

1288
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:24,474
how this whole ceremony
can work tonight.

1289
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,977
That's really gonna be
a big game changer.

1290
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:34,785
- I'm a little scared, I'll be
honest, I'm a little scared.

1291
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,362
- The way that this Rose
Ceremony is gonna work

1292
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,388
with two Bachelorettes
is one of the biggest things

1293
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,357
on everybody's mind
in the house.

1294
00:57:40,424 --> 00:57:42,626
We're not sure if each
Gabby and Rachel are gonna

1295
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:45,028
hand out a certain
amount of roses.

1296
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:46,563
If they're collectively

1297
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,266
gonna give one rose
to one person.

1298
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:51,702
Decisions are gonna be made,
tough decisions.

1299
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:54,805
But it's up to Gabby and Rachel
and whatever they decide to do.

1300
00:58:08,552 --> 00:58:10,554
- Hello, you two.
- Hi, Jesse.

1301
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,522
- How's it going?
- Good, how are you?

1302
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,624
- You both look fantastic.
- Thank you.

1303
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:16,035
- So fill me in,
tell me about the week.

1304
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:17,059
How'd it go?

1305
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:19,262
- It was pretty crazy.
- It was.

1306
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,198
We each had a one-on-one.
- Yes.

1307
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:23,200
- So we had
different experiences...

1308
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,235
- Mm-hmm.
- Which is, I feel like,

1309
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:26,870
gonna be normal moving forward.
- Yeah.

1310
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:30,307
- How hard was it to juggle
all those men together?

1311
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:33,443
- It makes it easier
to have her with me, honestly.

1312
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,213
We bounce ideas off each other
and kind of check in

1313
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,382
with one another
throughout the night and day.

1314
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:41,752
- So how do you decide
who's more into...

1315
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:43,262
That part to me
seems like it would be

1316
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:44,855
really, really confusing.

1317
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,189
- I think it's a little

1318
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:47,424
too early.
- Yeah.

1319
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:49,292
- I think there will be
a natural time

1320
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,594
when it splits off...
- Mm-hmm.

1321
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,963
- Mm-hmm.
- But it's still so early.

1322
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,197
- All right.

1323
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:55,875
Because you canceled
the first Rose Ceremony,

1324
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:57,601
there are 28 guys in there.

1325
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:58,869
As always, I'm here for you.

1326
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:00,179
If you need anything,
the night is yours.

1327
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,605
Go on in,
have fun, and good luck.

1328
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:02,806
- Ah!

1329
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,307
- Let's do it.
- See you guys.

1330
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,409
- Thanks, Jesse.

1331
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:07,377
I'm very excited to go into

1332
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:08,945
the cocktail party tonight,

1333
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:13,150
but I definitely had
a more rocky start to the week.

1334
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,053
I definitely thought at this
point I would have more guys

1335
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,655
I was extremely ready
to further a connection with,

1336
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:22,592
and right now, I'm at
square one with a lot of them.

1337
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:23,994
What if they don't like me?

1338
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:27,497
If these guys
don't step it up for me,

1339
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,875
maybe I'm gonna get
to the point where

1340
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,600
it just doesn't work out.

1341
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,378
- I think... I mean,
I think the most exciting part

1342
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,679
about tonight is,
we're finally gonna get

1343
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:35,038
some clarity and validation.

1344
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:36,825
Like that's really
when this journey starts.

1345
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,049
- Thank you.

1346
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:48,852
We just wanted
to welcome you guys tonight.

1347
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,855
Thank you so much
for an incredible week.

1348
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:55,292
As you guys know,
I sent Jordan home

1349
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:56,793
during our one-on-one this week,

1350
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,763
which was not an easy decision
for me,

1351
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:04,034
but I want to use this
as a lesson to everyone

1352
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:07,170
that one conversation
can truly change everything.

1353
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:09,005
- I'm actually
really proud of Rachel.

1354
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:11,108
We're gonna have
to make these hard decisions.

1355
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:13,510
It might seem like we have
a lot of time now, but things

1356
01:00:13,577 --> 01:00:15,712
do move pretty fast
around here, and we want to be

1357
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:19,349
able to foster the connections
that we do feel like we have.

1358
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:23,086
- Absolutely,
so cheers to a great night.

1359
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:25,288
- Yay!
- Cheers!

1360
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:26,766
- You know, guys are
starting to name drop

1361
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,992
and be like, "Oh, I'm team
Gabby, I'm team Rachel."

1362
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:31,394
You know, I got a chance
to connect with Gabby and was

1363
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,763
fortunate enough to get
the First Impression Rose.

1364
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,800
I don't want to neglect
the significance of that.

1365
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:39,269
But at the same time,
if there was any time

1366
01:00:39,336 --> 01:00:43,039
to get to know, you know,
Rachel, it's now.

1367
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:44,941
What's up, Gabby?
What's up, Rachel?

1368
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:47,777
What's up, Gabby?
What's up, Rachel?

1369
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:48,979
I appreciate your time.

1370
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:50,680
- Yes, absolutely.

1371
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:52,425
- We honestly haven't
had a chance to connect.

1372
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:54,260
- I was gonna say...
I was looking forward to it.

1373
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:55,561
- I was excited about
the Chicago vibe,

1374
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:56,887
so I was just like...
- Cups.

1375
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:58,798
- I met Gabby, I was like,
let me talk to Rachel.

1376
01:00:58,822 --> 01:00:59,832
- I'm glad.
No, I'm glad you pulled me.

1377
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:01,224
- So, as a career, you know,

1378
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:03,093
I'm a personal trainer,
and so I want

1379
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,303
to take you
through a mini workout.

1380
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,896
- Yes, please.
- Where you are not

1381
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,106
gonna be doing much...
- Okay.

1382
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,274
- But I'm gonna be
supporting you...

1383
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:09,408
- Okay.
- Because a part of being

1384
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:10,710
together is supporting
each other.

1385
01:01:10,734 --> 01:01:11,878
Okay, so follow me.
- Are we gonna go?

1386
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:12,836
- Yeah, we're gonna come
right here.

1387
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:13,837
- Okay. I'm ready.

1388
01:01:13,904 --> 01:01:15,639
I definitely was interested

1389
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:16,973
in Mario night one,

1390
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,277
but I am thinking about Gabby.

1391
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,787
Because he's her
First Impression Rose,

1392
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:23,013
it's a big deal.

1393
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,215
- I just want you
to stand right here, okay?

1394
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:26,616
I want you to face this way.

1395
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,752
Okay, keep turning,
keep turning, keep turning.

1396
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:30,129
Okay, I want you to be
right here,

1397
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:31,721
and I'm gonna pick you up.

1398
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:33,065
Beautiful, and we're gonna do...

1399
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:34,491
We're gonna move forward here.

1400
01:01:34,558 --> 01:01:35,935
All right, and I'm gonna do
three squats with you.

1401
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:37,069
Okay, you ready? Here we go.

1402
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:38,371
- When I saw Nate
on the helicopter last...

1403
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:39,872
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yesterday, when I saw Nate

1404
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:41,207
on the helicopter yesterday
with you I was like...

1405
01:01:41,231 --> 01:01:43,033
- Uh-huh.
- "Oh, man, dude, that's fun."

1406
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,377
You're good. Three.

1407
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:45,711
- Oh, I'm positive.
Hey, how's your day going?

1408
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:47,213
My name is Mario.
Oh, my gosh, get up.

1409
01:01:47,237 --> 01:01:49,406
Three, beautiful, okay.

1410
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:52,342
- I do think that I could
feel something for Mario.

1411
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:55,579
Like, he's very attractive
and passionate,

1412
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:59,316
and he picked me up,
and I was sweating a little.

1413
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,885
If the rest of the guys
continue to bring it,

1414
01:02:01,952 --> 01:02:04,387
tonight might look pretty good.

1415
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:08,925
- For my job, I own a seasonal
business on a boardwalk.

1416
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:10,827
- The Jersey Shore boardwalk.

1417
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:12,896
- Yeah, exactly.
- Is that where you work?

1418
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,431
- Yes. My brother...
- No way!

1419
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:16,833
- My brother and I own a bunch
of the basketball games

1420
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,604
up there, so we got 60 seconds.
- Mm.

1421
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,139
- Whenever you're ready...
Oh, it started up.

1422
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:24,641
- Oh, I only have one.

1423
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,576
I only have one!

1424
01:02:26,643 --> 01:02:28,211
- How many do you have?

1425
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:30,747
I was about to block you too.
No way.

1426
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:33,383
- No, the Bulls
aren't very good.

1427
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:36,186
- What did you just...
- I don't know what to say!

1428
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,288
- All right, well I won
at the end of the day,

1429
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:40,557
so I think I get a kiss.

1430
01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:45,161
- After my one-on-one
with Jordan,

1431
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:48,732
it was extremely disheartening,
but then tonight,

1432
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:50,967
I'm like,
so pleasantly surprised,

1433
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:54,471
like, oh, my gosh, I feel,
like, really good again.

1434
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:58,008
I hope that Gabby's having
as much fun as I'm having.

1435
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,553
- Like, I am excited
to get to know you.

1436
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:01,721
- Yeah.
- Like, you do seem like

1437
01:03:01,745 --> 01:03:03,680
a really, like, amazing person.

1438
01:03:03,747 --> 01:03:06,116
I thought we had, like, a...
- Do you have a mullet?

1439
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:09,586
- Yes, it's...
It doesn't go anywhere.

1440
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:10,863
Do you want to know
something ridiculous?

1441
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:12,689
- What?
- I was gonna come in tonight,

1442
01:03:12,756 --> 01:03:14,033
like, I was gonna, like,
have you... be able

1443
01:03:14,057 --> 01:03:15,601
to cut my hair?
- No, I'm so good at it.

1444
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,860
You should have.

1445
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,162
You look terrible.

1446
01:03:23,066 --> 01:03:24,634
- These guys tonight,

1447
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:26,603
they were kissing us,

1448
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:30,307
they were planning out fun
games and dates and activities.

1449
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:31,841
I was laughing all night.

1450
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:32,942
- Uh-huh.

1451
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,291
That's considered out,
but we made it.

1452
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:38,481
Good job.

1453
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,852
- I finally feel like
the Bachelorette tonight.

1454
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:44,921
- To tonight,
first Rose Ceremony,

1455
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,732
first actual Rose Ceremony.
- First real Rose Ceremony.

1456
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:48,425
- First real Rose Ceremony.

1457
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,094
- I think we should talk about

1458
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,697
what happened
in the house with Chris.

1459
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:54,998
Um...
- Right.

1460
01:03:55,065 --> 01:03:57,600
- Do you feel like,
you know, one of us should

1461
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,602
kind of bring it
to their attention?

1462
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,147
- I mean, if we could bring her
over here and sit her down,

1463
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,406
I 100% speak on basically

1464
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:04,517
what we talked about that night.

1465
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:05,584
- I just...
I think it's important

1466
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:06,752
for them to know his character.

1467
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:08,345
They need to know
the type of guys

1468
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:10,413
who are in this house,
and they're making decisions

1469
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,748
based off that.
- Yeah.

1470
01:04:11,815 --> 01:04:13,316
- What he said was,
if you made it

1471
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:15,085
to Fantasy Suites,
and if you were

1472
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:16,986
the third one to go...
- He would leave them.

1473
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:18,230
- Well, I feel like
because of what

1474
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:20,223
they went through,
I feel like I, you know...

1475
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:21,858
- Well, they're
even more sensitive.

1476
01:04:21,925 --> 01:04:23,369
- On the situation. Yeah.
- Exactly. Right.

1477
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:25,438
- They just went to the same
situation that he addressed.

1478
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:26,830
- Yeah.

1479
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:29,065
- Oh, yeah, they're gonna
want to know, of course.

1480
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:31,501
If someone says
something about me

1481
01:04:31,568 --> 01:04:34,471
and then you didn't tell me,
I will actually be

1482
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,907
more offended that
you didn't tell me.

1483
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:39,342
- Hello, how are you doing?

1484
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:41,144
It's nice to finally
get to talk to you.

1485
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:43,413
- I know.
- Oh, you're walking? Awesome.

1486
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,382
I love the suit.

1487
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,693
- I have to address, you know,
what's happening in the house.

1488
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,185
- What do you mean?

1489
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:53,356
- I think whoever overheard
the conversation and doesn't

1490
01:04:53,423 --> 01:04:56,126
bring it to their attention
is basically

1491
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:59,129
keeping secrets from their wife.

1492
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:00,797
- What's going on?

1493
01:05:00,864 --> 01:05:05,535
- Honestly, we just wanted
to talk about Chris.

1494
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:07,904
I wouldn't want you
to not know something,

1495
01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:09,706
so I want it to be very truthful

1496
01:05:09,773 --> 01:05:11,150
and allow you
to give you a situation.

1497
01:05:11,174 --> 01:05:12,108
- Okay.

1498
01:05:12,175 --> 01:05:13,676
- So Chris

1499
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,678
was talking to a few guys
this week

1500
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:19,516
about Fantasy Suites,
and his whole talk was,

1501
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,785
"If I made it to Fantasy Suites,

1502
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:23,453
"and if they had
slept with anyone,

1503
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,888
I would walk out and leave."

1504
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:26,156
- Okay.

1505
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:27,991
- So I asked a simple question:

1506
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:29,959
"Would you bring
this up before?"

1507
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:31,628
And he couldn't
answer the question.

1508
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:33,439
- So people are talking
about Fantasy Suites?

1509
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:35,031
- No, not everybody.

1510
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:36,766
- Who was talking about it?
- It came up.

1511
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:38,144
Chris brought it up
in a conversation.

1512
01:05:38,168 --> 01:05:39,645
- So he's bringing it up.
- Yes. Yeah.

1513
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,514
- I don't even know why sex
is being brought up.

1514
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:42,739
- Yeah.

1515
01:05:42,806 --> 01:05:44,607
- I can't believe
this is happening.

1516
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:46,609
When I came into this,
I didn't want to look like

1517
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:49,245
a girl that just got brought
to Fantasy Suites

1518
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:52,649
and, you know,
almost sexualized in a way.

1519
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:55,919
To hear that being brought up
before I have a conversation

1520
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:58,488
with someone is truly
almost my biggest fear.

1521
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:00,089
Okay, I just do want
to thank you guys.

1522
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:02,525
I'm gonna step away,
and I'm gonna talk to Gabby.

1523
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:08,298
The fact that Chris is already
discussing ultimatums

1524
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,934
to try to take control
of our journey,

1525
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,102
it just is extremely upsetting,

1526
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:16,039
and it's not how I wanted
this night to go.

1527
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,541
Hi, sorry, Justin.
- Oh, hi.

1528
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:20,052
- Gabby, can I talk to you
for a minute?

1529
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:21,353
- Yeah, oh, my gosh, yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

1530
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:22,712
- Okay.
- Yeah, please.

1531
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:24,647
- Sorry about that.
- No, please, by all means.

1532
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:26,382
- Yeah, we'll go outside.
- Okay.

1533
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,818
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God what?

1534
01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:30,186
- Yeah
- Tell me.

1535
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:39,496
- I just got brought
some information from Quincey,

1536
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:42,332
Jordan, and Hayden.
- Yeah.

1537
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:44,901
- They brought me over,
and they told me that

1538
01:06:44,968 --> 01:06:48,838
Chris is, like, talking about
Fantasy Suites already.

1539
01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:50,874
- Ew, what is he saying
about it?

1540
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,376
- He was basically saying
that if he was ever

1541
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:56,579
in a position where he
was brought to Fantasy Suites

1542
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:57,981
and we slept with someone else,

1543
01:06:58,047 --> 01:07:01,384
that he would leave,
but he wouldn't tell us.

1544
01:07:02,919 --> 01:07:04,521
- What?
- Yeah.

1545
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:05,955
- I'm pretty shocked.

1546
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,957
I haven't even had
one conversation with Chris,

1547
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,159
so for him to already be
talking about Fantasy Suites

1548
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:13,596
is... actually, it's, like,
entirely ridiculous.

1549
01:07:13,663 --> 01:07:18,167
- I think we do owe him
the opportunity to speak to us

1550
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:19,702
if you're okay
with hearing him out.

1551
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:20,970
- Yeah.

1552
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,172
It seems very controlling,

1553
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:26,709
and I think it's disrespectful
of our journey and our process.

1554
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,654
- I feel bad that we had
to address it because I saw

1555
01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:30,155
a look on her face
and she was just, like...

1556
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:32,057
- She was like, what the hell?
- She was disgusted.

1557
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,384
- 100%, she felt
extremely disrespected.

1558
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,319
- Oh, yo, bro, leave them.
Bro, leave them.

1559
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:39,656
- Oh, good. Thank God.

1560
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,157
- Hi.

1561
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:42,625
Chris, can we speak with you?

1562
01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:43,693
- Yeah, I'd like to.

1563
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,194
- If you'd like to come with us.

1564
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,362
- Yeah.

1565
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:48,031
This is about to everything up.

1566
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,165
- Yeah.
- No joke.

1567
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,734
- Nice to finally meet you.

1568
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:53,546
- So do you feel like
it's appropriate to be talking

1569
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,204
about Fantasy Suites this early?

1570
01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:01,544
- Yeah, so I sat down
with the guys the other day,

1571
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:04,981
and Fantasy Suites
was a conversation at the time.

1572
01:08:05,048 --> 01:08:06,983
You guys maybe had
some questions about it?

1573
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:08,093
- I don't think
we have questions.

1574
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:09,419
We'd like to hear from you.

1575
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:12,522
- Yeah, I think
it's an appropriate thought

1576
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:13,723
because the reality is,

1577
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:15,525
if I were gonna be able
to find love,

1578
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,827
I tend to think all the way
through till the end

1579
01:08:17,894 --> 01:08:19,772
and then be able to work it
backwards from there.

1580
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:21,230
So that would be my response.

1581
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:23,766
- Okay, but I guess
the problem I have is,

1582
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:27,236
they were saying that
if you were in a situation

1583
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:28,705
where you were
in a Fantasy Suite,

1584
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,541
that if Gabby or I decided
to be intimate

1585
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,677
with someone else,
that you would just leave

1586
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:36,312
and you wouldn't ever tell us

1587
01:08:36,379 --> 01:08:38,448
that that was
an ultimatum for you.

1588
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:40,259
And I think...
- That's not... I always want in

1589
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:43,052
relationships, the opportunity
for me to be able to speak

1590
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,622
for myself first
rather than for somebody else

1591
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:46,990
to tell you what my words are.

1592
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:49,859
Like, my exact
verbatim wording was,

1593
01:08:49,926 --> 01:08:52,362
"I wouldn't want to be
in a situation

1594
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:54,731
"where that person
who I was interested in

1595
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:57,000
"had a sexual relationship
with somebody else,

1596
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:57,967
"and then myself.

1597
01:08:58,034 --> 01:08:59,035
"At that situation,

1598
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:00,770
"I wouldn't be
interested anymore

1599
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:02,138
in continuing
the relationships."

1600
01:09:02,205 --> 01:09:05,041
I'm not taking away
anybody else's decision.

1601
01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:07,068
And that's something
that I would never want to do

1602
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,745
to a female is take away
their decision.

1603
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,980
- I understand that you're
thinking way far in advance,

1604
01:09:11,047 --> 01:09:13,383
but big picture,
this is four days in,

1605
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:16,919
and your very calculated
thoughts

1606
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,022
about Fantasy Suites

1607
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:22,892
are pretty inappropriate
at this time.

1608
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:24,336
- I wasn't the only person
to speak about it,

1609
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,738
but ultimately,
the conversation is about me.

1610
01:09:25,762 --> 01:09:26,839
- You were willing to talk
about it at depth,

1611
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:28,965
which, if you've
seen our journey...

1612
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:30,032
- Yeah.
- You would know

1613
01:09:30,066 --> 01:09:31,801
it'd be important to us.

1614
01:09:31,868 --> 01:09:35,071
And would respect our place
as women...

1615
01:09:35,138 --> 01:09:36,539
- Yes.
- In our position

1616
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:39,809
to make our own decisions,
which it seems like if we went

1617
01:09:39,876 --> 01:09:42,011
against something
you believed in,

1618
01:09:42,078 --> 01:09:44,247
you would take that time
to leave.

1619
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:47,050
- I feel like I'd like
the opportunity to meet you all

1620
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:48,451
individually and speak with you,

1621
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:49,962
but you all don't want
that opportunity with me...

1622
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:51,096
- I'm gonna stop you
right there.

1623
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,256
I really do feel like right now,

1624
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:54,590
you could take the opportunity

1625
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:56,993
to maybe apologize
and own up to what happened.

1626
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:58,561
But instead,
I still feel as if you're

1627
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:01,030
being condescending towards us.

1628
01:10:01,097 --> 01:10:02,999
I feel like you're dancing
around the issue.

1629
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:04,977
- I thought that I did tell you
exactly what happened.

1630
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:07,336
- We can help make
this decision at this point.

1631
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:09,706
I don't want anyone to be
thinking about Fantasy Suites.

1632
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,007
It's so early.

1633
01:10:11,074 --> 01:10:12,651
We don't even know
if we have a connection.

1634
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:14,744
- Right.
- And it sounds like you have

1635
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:16,412
pretty sure thoughts on it.

1636
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:18,748
So to not even put you
in that place,

1637
01:10:18,815 --> 01:10:21,084
I do think it would be time
for you to go.

1638
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,351
- Okay.

1639
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:24,454
- I'm gonna agree with her.

1640
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,788
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1641
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:27,457
- Can we walk you?
- Yeah.

1642
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:34,030
- They told Chris to leave.
- Yeah.

1643
01:10:34,097 --> 01:10:35,231
- Excuse me, guys.

1644
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:45,641
- You can actually lead us out.
- Okay.

1645
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,243
- They kicked him out.

1646
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:50,513
- Yeah, they just went
"You can walk us out."

1647
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,081
- All right,
so how does this work?

1648
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:54,217
I literally just walk
on this direction?

1649
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:56,252
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1650
01:11:02,225 --> 01:11:03,368
You handled that beautifully.

1651
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:04,827
- I thought you did.

1652
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:07,063
Oh, my God.

1653
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,431
- That was literally disgusting.

1654
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:10,109
- Yeah, and he's like,
"What do I do now?"

1655
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:12,935
It's like, leave. Just go!
- Leave. You walk out.

1656
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:15,738
- That was so crazy
by Chris bringing up

1657
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:17,673
these things so early
and trying to, like,

1658
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:21,511
control and dictate, it just
really shows that he's not

1659
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:24,180
the guy for us,
and I'm happy it's over.

1660
01:11:30,553 --> 01:11:33,055
- Ultimately,
if we didn't address this

1661
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,624
and somehow,
it got back to them,

1662
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,292
they would have
walked right in here,

1663
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:38,737
addressed all of us, and we all
would have felt like.

1664
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:42,865
- There he is.
- There he is.

1665
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:45,101
- Yeah.
- Friends, can I talk to you?

1666
01:11:45,168 --> 01:11:48,538
- Definitely, let's go.
- And Nate, can you come?

1667
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:50,640
Perfect.

1668
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:52,508
- Chris comes walking back in.

1669
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:56,078
I was sitting back just, like,
eating popcorn, like...

1670
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,414
- Jordan, can I borrow you?
- Yes, sir.

1671
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:01,050
Sweet. Where is Hayden?

1672
01:12:01,117 --> 01:12:02,051
Can we grab him?

1673
01:12:02,118 --> 01:12:03,052
It's pretty important.

1674
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:04,119
- He came back.

1675
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:09,401
- Can you guys just raise
your hands who was talking

1676
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:11,661
to Rachel, I thought
I just saw Rachel, like...

1677
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:13,996
So was that something that
you guys asked her to do

1678
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:16,165
or did she ask you guys
to come and do that?

1679
01:12:16,232 --> 01:12:17,609
I don't imagine
she asked you to come

1680
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:19,044
and do it because
she didn't know at the time.

1681
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:20,603
- We were discussing
what happened

1682
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,572
this week,
and that was brought up.

1683
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:24,841
And we felt like they need to...

1684
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:26,251
They need to know what was...
- Excuse me.

1685
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:27,610
- Talked about that night.

1686
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,321
- Can we interrupt you guys?
- Yeah, you need to...

1687
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,546
- What's going on?

1688
01:12:30,613 --> 01:12:31,781
Ah.

1689
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,282
- We did ask you to leave.

1690
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:34,684
- You did.
- Yeah.

1691
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,819
- I think that's all
that needs to be said.

1692
01:12:36,886 --> 01:12:38,454
- Okay.
- If they asked you to leave,

1693
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:39,598
just be a gentleman and go.
- All right, yes.

1694
01:12:39,622 --> 01:12:40,556
- Okay.
- Yeah, absolutely.

1695
01:12:40,623 --> 01:12:41,703
- Thank you, appreciate it.

1696
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,063
- What Chris did does not show

1697
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:49,365
any qualities
of what I want in a partner.

1698
01:12:49,432 --> 01:12:52,101
The fact that he just thought
he could do whatever he wants,

1699
01:12:52,168 --> 01:12:54,237
I don't know if it's 'cause
Gabby and I are women,

1700
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:57,773
but it's our decision,
and we told you to leave.

1701
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:03,379
- I'm sorry to the guys that
that took time away from,

1702
01:13:03,446 --> 01:13:04,814
'cause that was
kind of brought up.

1703
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,583
- Yeah, we appreciate, like,
the compassion, though.

1704
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,987
- Gentlemen, I'm sorry,
but it is the time

1705
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,022
of the night,
the cocktail party is over.

1706
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:14,333
We gotta get ready
for the Rose Ceremony,

1707
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:16,626
and so I do have to steal
these two lovely ladies.

1708
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:17,960
Ladies, after you.

1709
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:25,401
- I don't feel at ease.

1710
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:27,837
Everyone got
their time completely

1711
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:31,140
derailed by everything
that happened.

1712
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:32,675
- It's been a long night.

1713
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:34,944
I didn't get a chance
to spend some time with Gabby.

1714
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:36,612
I think after that
First Impression Rose,

1715
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:38,047
she was like, "Hey,"

1716
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:40,216
and it actually
really sucks that

1717
01:13:40,283 --> 01:13:42,084
it happened the night
of a Rose Ceremony.

1718
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:44,387
- I didn't get a chance
to speak with Rachel,

1719
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:47,356
but hopefully I made
enough of an impression to,

1720
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,358
you know,
make it through the night.

1721
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,894
- Chris' drama took up time
that I could have had,

1722
01:13:51,961 --> 01:13:53,429
and I didn't even
get to see them.

1723
01:13:53,496 --> 01:13:55,264
And I don't know
what's gonna happen at all.

1724
01:13:55,331 --> 01:13:56,933
I have no idea.

1725
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,334
I don't want to go home tonight.

1726
01:14:19,255 --> 01:14:22,658
- Gentlemen, welcome
to your first Rose Ceremony.

1727
01:14:22,725 --> 01:14:24,994
There are a lot of you
here tonight.

1728
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:29,598
27, to be exact,
so you already know

1729
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:32,468
there's gonna be
a big cut tonight.

1730
01:14:32,535 --> 01:14:34,003
Many of you will be going home.

1731
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:37,182
You're also probably
wondering how

1732
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:38,283
this whole thing
is gonna work tonight

1733
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,608
having two Bachelorettes.

1734
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:41,811
Well, Rachel and Gabby,
they've both informed me

1735
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:43,846
that the roses
they hand out tonight,

1736
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:46,148
they're coming from both women.

1737
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:49,352
It means that
both Gabby and Rachel,

1738
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,120
they want you around.

1739
01:14:51,187 --> 01:14:53,456
Logan, Nate, Johnny.

1740
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:55,291
You all have roses,
which means, of course,

1741
01:14:55,358 --> 01:14:57,893
you're all safe,
and for the rest of you,

1742
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,429
if you do not
receive a rose tonight,

1743
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,465
you will be leaving here
immediately.

1744
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,534
- I'm wicked nervous.

1745
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,870
This has never been done,
two Bachelorettes,

1746
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:11,207
having so many guys,
it's... it's insane.

1747
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:12,942
- I'll go get Gabby and Rachel.

1748
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:15,111
- You know, Jesse said
they're gonna hand out roses

1749
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,580
jointly together
and present a joint rose.

1750
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:20,116
But I'm a one-woman type of guy,

1751
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,418
and I want to go all in
on Rachel.

1752
01:15:22,485 --> 01:15:25,988
She's every guy's dream girl,
so I'm hoping that

1753
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:28,591
I get a rose, but I'd like it
to be from her.

1754
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,068
- Hi, guys.

1755
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:43,039
We just wanted to say that
we had such an incredible night

1756
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:45,741
with all of you,
and this decision, of course,

1757
01:15:45,808 --> 01:15:48,010
is not easy.

1758
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:51,747
You are all incredible men,
and we had such an amazing time

1759
01:15:51,814 --> 01:15:53,682
getting to know you all more.

1760
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:57,353
But ultimately, we just really
have to follow our hearts.

1761
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:00,189
- Yeah, and we just wanted
to let you all know that

1762
01:16:00,256 --> 01:16:03,559
receiving a rose tonight
means that Rachel and I both

1763
01:16:03,626 --> 01:16:06,328
would like to invite you
into next week.

1764
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:19,275
Jason.

1765
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:25,915
Jason, will you accept
this rose?

1766
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:27,550
- I would love to.

1767
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,332
- Aven.

1768
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:50,005
Aven, will you accept this rose?

1769
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:51,107
- Of course.

1770
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:55,177
- If I don't get a rose
tonight, I'll be heartbroken.

1771
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:56,445
- Erich.

1772
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:01,951
Erich, will you
accept this rose?

1773
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:03,853
- Of course, Gabby.

1774
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:06,055
- I hate that I was
in the drama about Chris

1775
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:09,191
and about all
the Fantasy Suite stuff.

1776
01:17:09,258 --> 01:17:12,027
Other than that, like,
I didn't get any time.

1777
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:14,563
I'm worried these women,
they don't know

1778
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,198
who I am
and where I'm coming from.

1779
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:17,433
- Zach.

1780
01:17:22,538 --> 01:17:23,873
Will you accept this rose?

1781
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:25,474
- Absolutely.

1782
01:17:32,548 --> 01:17:33,883
- Jordan.

1783
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:41,223
Jordan, will you
accept this rose?

1784
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,324
- Absolutely.

1785
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:51,167
- Quincey.

1786
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:55,538
- I want a rose so badly.

1787
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:57,173
I mean, just to continue this

1788
01:17:57,239 --> 01:18:01,043
with Rachel and Gabby
would be amazing for me.

1789
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:02,611
- Michael.

1790
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:05,114
- Because of Chris,
I didn't get time

1791
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:08,317
with Rachel and Gabby tonight,
so I'm kind of nervous.

1792
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:10,319
- Tino.

1793
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:12,087
- It doesn't matter,
at the end of the day,

1794
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:13,722
whether it's
from Gabby or Rachel.

1795
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:15,791
I just want a chance
to fully show them

1796
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:17,426
who I am as a person.

1797
01:18:19,395 --> 01:18:20,429
- Jacob.

1798
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,535
Jacob, will you
accept this rose?

1799
01:18:26,602 --> 01:18:27,903
- Of course. Thank you.

1800
01:18:35,678 --> 01:18:36,712
- Tyler.

1801
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:41,450
- I am all in on Rachel.

1802
01:18:41,517 --> 01:18:45,387
No question about it,
it's Rachel every day.

1803
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:46,722
Doesn't even matter.

1804
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,093
- Termayne.

1805
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:54,897
- I'm definitely nervous
right now.

1806
01:18:54,964 --> 01:18:57,166
Some of the guys
that I felt like didn't have

1807
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:59,468
as strong of a connection
with Gabby as I did,

1808
01:18:59,535 --> 01:19:00,655
you know, have gotten roses.

1809
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,272
- Hayden.

1810
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:08,043
- It makes me kind of
question, you know,

1811
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:09,311
was Gabby just being nice?

1812
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:10,589
Did she actually enjoy our time?

1813
01:19:10,613 --> 01:19:11,647
- Meatball.

1814
01:19:13,015 --> 01:19:14,192
- You know,
I don't know right now,

1815
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:15,536
and I'm honestly
a little worried.

1816
01:19:23,559 --> 01:19:25,127
- Looking around me,
everyone has

1817
01:19:25,194 --> 01:19:27,496
a rose, it feels like,
except for me.

1818
01:19:27,563 --> 01:19:30,866
I was very confident coming in.

1819
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:33,402
That confidence certainly
has been shot down a little.

1820
01:19:33,469 --> 01:19:34,570
- Spencer.

1821
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:42,177
Spencer, will you
accept this rose?

1822
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:43,279
- Yes, ma'am.

1823
01:19:44,647 --> 01:19:46,515
- It's difficult
attempting to get to know

1824
01:19:46,582 --> 01:19:48,183
two Bachelorettes.

1825
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,661
Well, I had
a conversation with Rachel,

1826
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:52,488
and I do think Gabby
felt a little slighted.

1827
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:54,394
I know she saw me with Rachel,
and she probably

1828
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,525
was like,
"What the hell is going on?"

1829
01:19:56,592 --> 01:19:57,726
- Alec.

1830
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:04,900
- This evening has been
a little challenging.

1831
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:08,203
I am just hoping
that my name gets called.

1832
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:09,405
- Ethan.

1833
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:15,311
Will you accept this rose?
- Of course I will.

1834
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:31,794
- Rachel, Gabby, gentlemen.

1835
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,295
It's the final rose tonight.

1836
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:35,064
When you ladies are ready.

1837
01:20:52,648 --> 01:20:53,682
- Mario.

1838
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,825
Mario, will you
accept this rose?

1839
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:03,926
- Yes.

1840
01:21:15,771 --> 01:21:16,905
- Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

1841
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:18,240
If you did not receive a rose,

1842
01:21:18,307 --> 01:21:20,576
please take a moment,
say your goodbyes.

1843
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:31,687
- Bye, thank you.

1844
01:21:31,754 --> 01:21:33,355
- Giving me time,
I appreciate that.

1845
01:21:33,422 --> 01:21:35,124
- Bye, John.

1846
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:37,025
- That whole thing was tough.

1847
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:38,427
- Pleasure meeting you.
- You too.

1848
01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:40,362
It was nice meeting you.

1849
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:43,732
- It was an extremely
wild ride, and I didn't know

1850
01:21:43,799 --> 01:21:47,069
that I would be able
to have these strong feelings

1851
01:21:47,136 --> 01:21:48,737
in this short amount of time.

1852
01:21:48,804 --> 01:21:50,873
So that completely
blindsided me.

1853
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:52,441
Gabby, thank you so much.

1854
01:21:52,508 --> 01:21:53,952
- Thank you. You too.
- It was so nice to meet you.

1855
01:21:53,976 --> 01:21:56,478
You be happy, okay?
- Wonderful, thank you.

1856
01:21:56,545 --> 01:21:58,423
- Rachel, nice to meet you.
- It was so nice to meet you.

1857
01:21:58,447 --> 01:22:00,082
- Have so much fun, go be happy.

1858
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:02,384
- Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

1859
01:22:02,451 --> 01:22:03,895
- You think you know
how you're gonna feel,

1860
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:10,225
and then saying bye to two
beautiful, amazing women.

1861
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:12,728
It's almost like
it's over before it started.

1862
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:17,433
- So I know these nights
can be very long,

1863
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:21,403
but you guys truly all made it
so worth it, and you were able

1864
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:24,640
to really have our backs today
and pick us up.

1865
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:27,042
I do think
my person could be here.

1866
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:31,547
I feel noticed and supported
by all of these guys,

1867
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,849
which is the only thing
I can ask for,

1868
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:36,118
so it has been
an incredible night.

1869
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:39,455
- We really do
appreciate you all so much,

1870
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:42,591
and we're excited
to see what's to come.

1871
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:44,560
So cheers.

1872
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:47,429
- Cheers through pushing
a super tough night.

1873
01:22:47,496 --> 01:22:49,598
You know, I was the last
to get called.

1874
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:51,867
It was
a nerve-racking experience,

1875
01:22:51,934 --> 01:22:54,269
But I'm...
I'm happy to have a rose.

1876
01:22:56,038 --> 01:22:59,608
Just trying to process not only
what happened just now,

1877
01:22:59,675 --> 01:23:04,847
but, like, also my connection
with... with both of them.

1878
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:06,381
This is actually more difficult

1879
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:08,150
to navigate than I thought.

1880
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:11,286
There's two Bachelorettes.

1881
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:12,387
To love.

1882
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:14,189
To love.

1883
01:23:14,256 --> 01:23:16,825
- Next week on
"The Bachelorette"...

1884
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:19,728
- Bring on the men!

1885
01:23:19,795 --> 01:23:21,230
- Ready for my close-up.

1886
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:23,365
- Gabby and I
want to feel chosen.

1887
01:23:23,432 --> 01:23:25,767
- Your smile melts my heart.
- Aw.

1888
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,737
- Right now,
I feel so loved and seen.

1889
01:23:28,804 --> 01:23:30,539
It's really such a good feeling.

1890
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:32,174
- Have you got a date for me?

1891
01:23:32,241 --> 01:23:35,444
- This is all about finding
love and, like, I feel like

1892
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:37,322
I'm gonna remember this
for the rest of my life.

1893
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:40,115
It just feels like
a really beautiful start

1894
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:43,485
to what could be something
really amazing.

1895
01:23:43,552 --> 01:23:45,187
- If you were
the only person here,

1896
01:23:45,254 --> 01:23:48,123
I don't think I could
have the heart to continue.

1897
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,225
"I don't want a woman
like you."

1898
01:23:50,292 --> 01:23:51,860
It hurts to hear.

1899
01:23:51,927 --> 01:23:53,362
- Like,
because there's two of us,

1900
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:54,997
they think
they can act that way.

1901
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:57,766
- I don't know if I have
the capacity to keep

1902
01:23:57,833 --> 01:23:59,935
doing this, like,
week after week.

1903
01:24:00,002 --> 01:24:01,603
- Will you accept this rose?

1904
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:03,539
- Um...

1905
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:04,883
- Dude, the girls
just walked out.

1906
01:24:04,907 --> 01:24:06,675
- My brain is spinning
right now.

1907
01:24:06,742 --> 01:24:07,752
- I want to know
what the hell happened.

1908
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:09,011
- This whole thing

1909
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:10,188
is just not working for them.

1910
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:12,147
- That's bad.
- It's really bad.

1911
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:14,449
- I'm leaving,
I'm literally quitting.

1912
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,398
- And do you guys like
spaghetti and meatballs?

1913
01:24:20,422 --> 01:24:21,633
- We do.
- Yeah, that's one of my...

1914
01:24:21,657 --> 01:24:22,867
- I got a little surprise...
- Oh, my God!

1915
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,393
- Got a little...
- Oh, my goodness!

1916
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:25,770
- I'll be in the middle.
- Thank you.

1917
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:27,462
- You know how I like meatballs.

1918
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:31,667
I'm lucky that
I got both of you.

1919
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,402
It's like getting
the president, I mean...

1920
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:35,070
- Two of us equal the president.

1921
01:24:35,137 --> 01:24:37,406
I mean...

1922
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:39,808
- Cheers to Meatball.
- Let's all cheers to Meatball.

1923
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:41,243
And let's go.
- Cheers.

1924
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:42,420
- Let's have a good night.
- Cheers.

1925
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:43,444
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1926
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:46,381
- Gonna have to do that again.

1927
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:47,649
So I come from a big family.

1928
01:24:47,716 --> 01:24:49,885
I got two brothers
and two sisters.

1929
01:24:49,952 --> 01:24:51,053
We all have nicknames.

1930
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:52,521
My nickname is Meatball.

1931
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:55,390
As I said in my entrance.
- What are their nicknames?

1932
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:56,558
Sausage?
- So...

1933
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,796
- Meatball can continue
to just pull Gabby and I

1934
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:02,831
every single Rose Ceremony
and have a sit down

1935
01:25:02,898 --> 01:25:06,234
meal with us,
and he's going all the way.

1936
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:07,669
- Gabby, can we...

1937
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:09,571
Yeah.

1938
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,709
- Oh, oh, there you go.

1939
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,711
Wait, you guys need to kiss,
though.

1940
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,045
- Oh!
- Sure you do.

1941
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,947
You wish.

1942
01:25:18,971 --> 01:25:20,971
