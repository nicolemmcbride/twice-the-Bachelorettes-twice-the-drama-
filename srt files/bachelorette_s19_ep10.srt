1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:03,103
- Previously
on "The Bachelorette"...

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,549
- My heart's a little bit
in my throat saying this,

3
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,074
but I love you, Rachel.

4
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,943
- It was love in paradise...

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,688
- Don't forget
I'm falling in love with you.

6
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:12,813
- I'm in love with you too.

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,181
- Whoo!

8
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:17,651
- Until it wasn't.

9
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,086
- So is this our goodbye?

10
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:20,487
- I think so.

11
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,956
As much as like I don't
wanna say goodbye to Johnny,

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,359
I know there's
something waiting for me

13
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,960
that's really great.

14
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,463
- Right now it's hard
for me to like get

15
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,198
to the point of engagement.

16
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,966
- I'm not like
a super jealous person,

17
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,868
but I'm like picturing
a girl that like

18
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:37,638
I'm in love with
doing that with somebody else.

19
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,172
Like, that kinda crushes me.

20
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,575
- So you brought me here
to tell me it again.

21
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,710
No, no.

22
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,780
- And tonight...

23
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:49,550
- I'm scared that
I could leave here alone.

24
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,385
Erich up last night.

25
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,420
I felt like
I was being almost pressured

26
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:54,955
into a decision.

27
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:56,390
Ah!

28
00:00:56,456 --> 00:01:00,093
But with Jason, I never
have to defend myself.

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,504
- To feel this strongly
about somebody

30
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,363
and know that you can lose
that person,

31
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,798
that's a horrible feeling.

32
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,434
- Zach is everything
that I want in a partner.

33
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,670
- We did have a big night.

34
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,947
Proposal is right
around this corner.

35
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:11,905
- For sure.

36
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,974
I'm having a lot of anxiety.

37
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,944
- After Fantasy Suite,
everything took a 180.

38
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,612
I felt blindsided.

39
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,759
That was the last thing you
could have ever expected.

40
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:25,452
- Tonight, like I wanna be
fully honest and transparent.

41
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,425
- Gabby will not be joining you.

42
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,360
You're the only Bachelorette
here.

43
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:35,996
- Is it me?

44
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:41,301
What is it about me
that's so hard to love?

45
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:03,924
- I'm scared.

46
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,960
You know,
I'm feeling really nervous.

47
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:10,830
Gabby walked away, and that
could be the end of it.

48
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:11,832
I, you know,
brought up something

49
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:12,833
that we had talked about

50
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,168
in confidence and in privacy.

51
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,204
At this point, there are
other people involved,

52
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,507
and she still has more,
you know, Fantasy Suite dates.

53
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,379
You know, I kinda lost trust
in us and her.

54
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:32,853
It got really in my head,
and I wish I didn't.

55
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:34,353
I up.

56
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,684
- You okay?
- Yeah.

57
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,157
I just sometimes need a second.

58
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:15,128
And I don't like wanna
be upset like wrongfully.

59
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:19,232
So I think 'cause we had talked
about it multiple times

60
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,103
just us two,
I didn't know if you truly

61
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,738
did want me to say something.

62
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,006
No., no.

63
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:30,644
Listen, the reality is
I am in love with you,

64
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,012
and I'm terrified of losing you.

65
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,981
So I up an opportunity
and this was just

66
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,017
supposed to be
like positive and just us

67
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,124
like to sneak in a moment.

68
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,453
- Yeah.

69
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,687
- 'Cause I'm scared.

70
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,031
- I think your heart
is in the right place,

71
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,691
but I don't...

72
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:49,029
I've like worked my ass off

73
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:53,133
for there to be like no question

74
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,602
on making good decisions.

75
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,805
- It came from
a moment of insecurity

76
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,408
and like these
unjustified doubts.

77
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,844
And then I'm like,
what the is going on?

78
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,980
Like...

79
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:10,350
But every time I see you,
it's like, all right.

80
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,952
- Yeah.

81
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,167
- I'm sorry.
I don't wanna see you sad.

82
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,802
- No, it's okay.

83
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,344
- I up a...
- It could have been

84
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,279
a good moment,
and I'm really sorry.

85
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,127
I just don't wanna lose you
at this point.

86
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,417
- So much has happened
this week,

87
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,486
but it's just like crazy.

88
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:22,155
And like, my head's everywhere.

89
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,957
It all started with my
overnight date.

90
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:29,930
Johnny and I decided that this
wasn't the right time with us.

91
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,033
I knew that he can't give me
what I deserve,

92
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,868
and it was time to say goodbye.

93
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,906
During our overnight,
Erich and I's relationship

94
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,675
has grown really strong.

95
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:46,279
A couple days ago,
leaving our morning together,

96
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,448
I felt so good about him,

97
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,117
like he really
could be the one for me.

98
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:53,787
But then he
all of that up last night.

99
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,624
Erich was telling me
how much he loved me

100
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,794
and how hard it is for him,
especially this week,

101
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,263
because this week
felt like cheating to him.

102
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,700
And I know that,
because in Fantasy Suites,

103
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,846
when it was just him and I,

104
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:11,538
we had the same exact
conversation.

105
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,341
And going through all those
emotions multiple times

106
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,276
is exhausting.

107
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,781
My first gut reaction was,
why are we rehashing this now?

108
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:22,782
- Mm-hmm.
- We had already

109
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,184
talked about it.

110
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,619
Like, when it was
just me and you,

111
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,188
wasn't that enough,
and didn't that mean more?

112
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,390
- You sort of have that
dropped on you

113
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:31,801
at a moment
you weren't expecting it.

114
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,627
- Right. It's unfair to me.

115
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,961
I didn't get any sleep.

116
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:38,164
I was still so confused,
and I felt so hurt.

117
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,001
And I don't think
I really understood

118
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,245
where he was coming from, so...

119
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:45,505
- I'm sorry, you know,
that happened.

120
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,440
I just know you guys shared

121
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,308
a lot of really special
moments together.

122
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,911
- Yeah.

123
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,680
I was definitely
disappointed 'cause

124
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,017
I felt like I was being almost
pressured into a decision.

125
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,619
And I know myself,
I just need a lot of space

126
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,588
in order to be able to think.

127
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,624
Um... oh.
I don't wanna cry.

128
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,594
But I think like this whole time

129
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:12,799
it has been just really hard
because I've wanted

130
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:16,569
to make a right decision,
like for myself and for them.

131
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,773
And like, Erich and I have
like gone through so much.

132
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,676
We don't have the best way
of communicating,

133
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,912
but he has like always
fought for me.

134
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,348
And I think I've always
fought for him.

135
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,116
Erich and I,
we've always struggled

136
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,703
with this miscommunication,
but I think

137
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,354
we're also
very different people.

138
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,856
I'm mad at him
because I still have

139
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,893
my overnight date with Jason.

140
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,195
I felt like
I was being pressured.

141
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,332
So I'm like, this is...
This is it, you know.

142
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,866
We're not meant to be.

143
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,411
Like I knew
it was too good to be true.

144
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,669
- It's not easy.

145
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,671
So you can see
how you could feel that way.

146
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:52,872
- Yeah.

147
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,541
I have to be honest with myself.

148
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,977
And if it's my decision
to be with Erich, it's mine.

149
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,112
And if it's my decision
to be with Jason,

150
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,247
like, it's nobody else.

151
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,317
I want this to be my decision.

152
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,528
- I'm around if you need me.
- Okay.

153
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,020
Sounds good.
- All right, Gabby.

154
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,189
We'll see ya.
- Okay.

155
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,959
I don't really know like where
to go from here or what to do,

156
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,328
but I know I just have to
continue to follow my heart.

157
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:25,005
Today is my overnight date
with Jason.

158
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,507
I do just wanna
like soak up these moments

159
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:31,311
we have with each other.

160
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,846
I am falling in love with him,

161
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:36,915
and this overnight date
is so important.

162
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:40,286
I'm hoping that it
just brings us together

163
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:42,054
and that we can see ourselves

164
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,458
one step closer
to an engagement.

165
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,827
I know there's no question
to his intentions.

166
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,037
- That's a big day for us.

167
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,705
I am here for Gabby.

168
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,474
When I'm with her, like I
just have an amazing time

169
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,611
and like we get each other
on like a deeper level too.

170
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:08,314
I'm just kind of reflecting
on this past Hometown Date.

171
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,884
I started feeling
that I'm not at a place

172
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,319
where I'm ready to get engaged.

173
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,090
I'm doing my best to stay true
to myself, and just for me,

174
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,992
it just doesn't feel right.

175
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,395
I need to tell Gabby
where I stand

176
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:23,663
and be honest with her.

177
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,664
I'm nervous.

178
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,932
I'm stressed out.

179
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,801
I have no idea
how she's gonna react.

180
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:48,421
- This week has been pretty
hard up until this point.

181
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:53,093
But today I get to focus on
the overnight date with Jason.

182
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,528
I really can't wait to see him.

183
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,100
- Hey.

184
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,768
- I'm falling in love
with Jason,

185
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,536
and I believe
he feels the same way,

186
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,006
but he hasn't been able
to tell me how he feels.

187
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,208
Hi.

188
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,012
I've been looking forward
to this day,

189
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,781
'cause I know
he's such a private person.

190
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,382
- It's so good to see you.

191
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,085
- You too.

192
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,221
- There's an option,
you know, for an overnight,

193
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,389
where we can just get
really private time

194
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,059
and have some intimacy
to see if we're truly

195
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,328
as compatible as I think we are.

196
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,631
Our whole relationship
could change tonight.

197
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:35,001
Okay, well, welcome to Mexico.

198
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,769
It's so good to see you.

199
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,238
- You too.
- It's been so long.

200
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,906
- It's crazy.
It feels like a year.

201
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,508
- I know.
- So what do we do?

202
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,009
Go to
the all-you-can-eat buffet?

203
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,911
Actually, yeah.

204
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,313
Well, no. There is something.

205
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,117
And um, it's something
I'm really good at

206
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,953
that you maybe
have never done before,

207
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,824
but I'm excited for us
to learn and grow together.

208
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,201
- What is it?
- So do you wanna see?

209
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,227
- Yeah. Let's go.
- Okay, we'll see.

210
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,296
I'm nervous.

211
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,540
I'm nervous.
- Don't be nervous.

212
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,633
No.

213
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,841
We're playing tennis.

214
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,210
Oh, God.

215
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,687
- I thought we were
gonna be dancing.

216
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,280
- No, no.

217
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,826
- I was ready to dance
or something...

218
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,017
- I know. I sold it.
- "I'm good at it."

219
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,819
- So Jason and I
are playing tennis today,

220
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,588
which is something
that he loves.

221
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,256
He played tennis in college,

222
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:33,326
and I wanna be able to share
all of the passions

223
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,761
that my partner has.

224
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,430
So I am excited for him
to like teach me

225
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,732
and see him in his element.

226
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,736
I did it.
You missed it.

227
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,805
- No, we're supposed
to go back and forth.

228
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,540
- That was good.

229
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,611
Oh! There you go.

230
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,046
- Oh, my God.
I'm so good.

231
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,815
- Getting on the tennis court
with Gabby was amazing.

232
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,917
And I kinda was just
in the moment,

233
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,285
and she was good.

234
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,632
She was actually like a natural.

235
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,422
- Do you think I'm good?

236
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,191
- I think you're like
the best player I've ever seen.

237
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,328
No!

238
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,364
I want him to actually hit me
in my butt with the racket.

239
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,199
So hot.

240
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,368
We'll see.

241
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,536
Teach me how to serve.

242
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:17,937
That's all I care about.

243
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,906
- I'll teach you how to serve.
- Yeah.

244
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,741
Why do you have so many balls?

245
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,088
- 'Cause you're gonna need them.

246
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,144
Let's go to that side though.

247
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,646
The sun.

248
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,615
What? What?

249
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,687
- Jason and I are just
like so easy together.

250
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,465
You know, we're just doing
something kind of mundane,

251
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,926
like tennis, but somehow
we make it so fun.

252
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,495
I feel like I never
have to explain myself.

253
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:45,932
I can just like be
whoever I wanna be.

254
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,000
- Get low.

255
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,134
Like this.

256
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,135
- I can't stay low.

257
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,104
- No, that's it. Right there.

258
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,339
I didn't say to be a crab.

259
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:54,841
I said get low.

260
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,943
- I think like we
just get each other

261
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,946
and accept each other
for who we are.

262
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:00,947
- Damn.
- That was fast.

263
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:01,948
- That was actually good.

264
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,750
That was like 220.

265
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,885
220 miles per hour.

266
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,587
Yeah. I think today
was just like kind of

267
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,223
what I needed
just like to feel...

268
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,924
feel at home a little bit.

269
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,260
We should do target practice.
- Yeah. What's that?

270
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,928
- We have to hit
the water bottle.

271
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,363
- Okay.
Let me get up here.

272
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,464
- Okay. Fine.

273
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,604
- I did it!
- Oh. What?

274
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:28,308
I had more fun today
than I could have imagined.

275
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,477
It just felt special.

276
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,946
If there was any date
I could ask for,

277
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,548
today was what I would want.

278
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,216
Honestly, I think
you're ready to go pro.

279
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,584
You're amazing.

280
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,895
But yeah,
in the back of my mind,

281
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,721
there is this
big conversation tonight

282
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:45,491
about the future for us
outside of this.

283
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,696
At the end of the day,
like, I might not be having

284
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,331
the same path
as some of the other guys,

285
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,032
but I know
what feels good to me,

286
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:56,102
and seems like we're both
feeling good.

287
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,137
- I'm dying.

288
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,773
Should we change into our
swimsuits and go to the pool?

289
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,242
Please. Please.

290
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,348
- Do we get in?
- Yes.

291
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,716
Let's go.

292
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,919
Are we cannonballing?
- Yeah, sure.

293
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,188
- Yeah. Ready?
- Yeah.

294
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,156
- All right, let's go.
- It's not very deep!

295
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,257
Ah!

296
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,170
- I can't stop thinking
about Gabby.

297
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,839
The last time,
you know, I saw her,

298
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,308
um, I let my insecurities
kinda get the best of me.

299
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,945
Ah, you're so strong!

300
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,049
- I brought up
her other Fantasy Suites,

301
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,251
and she was upset.

302
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,620
Makes me think like I don't
necessarily know where we are.

303
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,333
Ultimately, at the end
of the day, like

304
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,960
my biggest fear
is like losing her now, so...

305
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,729
Like this week, I know
when I'm just by myself,

306
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:59,165
she is on a date
with somebody else

307
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,072
and like has a relationship
with somebody else.

308
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,804
I know how special our date
was, and for her to experience

309
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,348
that with somebody else now
at this point

310
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,740
just feels like weird.

311
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,742
Okay. Okay.

312
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:13,012
Okay! Ah!

313
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,158
- This has been
like by far the hardest week,

314
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,684
because I have told her
how I feel truly.

315
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,021
So now to feel this strongly
about somebody

316
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,857
and know that like you
can lose that person,

317
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,659
that's a horrible feeling.

318
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,296
How was it
talking to my mom and...

319
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,732
- She was like, so nice.
We got along easy.

320
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,001
I told her, I don't know,
things I saw in you,

321
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,104
and like how good you were
and are with me.

322
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:41,540
- I was telling her how like
genuine and real you are.

323
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,745
And she was like, "No, I
can tell, like instantly."

324
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,022
- Oh, that's good.
- Like she's...

325
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,581
I think
she's your number one fan.

326
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,368
- Aw!
- Oh, my God, that means a lot.

327
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:52,060
When you were outside,
we were like talking

328
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,320
about touching up our roots
and stuff.

329
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,689
Like that's how
I know it's real.

330
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,257
- Yeah.
- Like she gets me.

331
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,159
- Yeah.
- But no, this is so much fun.

332
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,328
- I did have fun.
- I just like being with you.

333
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:03,629
- Yeah.
That's what I said too.

334
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,798
Like every time I'm with you,
it's just like,

335
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,366
no matter what we do, it's fun.

336
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,837
Yeah. It's a strange place,

337
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,940
but when I'm with you,
it feels normal.

338
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,842
That's what I think.
- Yeah.

339
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,177
- You know, I can't
wait for these dates.

340
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,480
It's the best.
- I know, me either.

341
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,516
Every time I see you,
it's like no time has passed.

342
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,156
Today has been such a great day.

343
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,824
And being with him
just really feels

344
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:35,928
like completely
effortless in every sense.

345
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,564
I think it has really
exceeded all my expectations.

346
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,700
I know we have fun together,

347
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,935
but this is like more than fun.

348
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,504
It's really just comfort.

349
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,975
You're so salty.
- You're salty.

350
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,313
I am truly falling
in love with him.

351
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,116
Going into dinner tonight,
I'm hoping that Jason and I

352
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,985
can talk more
about our feelings.

353
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,890
I know my feelings
are really strong,

354
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:07,727
and I can definitely see him
at the end of this with me.

355
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:16,335
After today, I just know
it's gonna work for us.

356
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,825
- Going into dinner
with Jason tonight,

357
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,094
I'm really excited.

358
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,063
I think today
I really didn't know

359
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,399
where my head was gonna be at,

360
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,601
but like Jason just gets it.

361
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,439
I can see myself
engaged to Jason.

362
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,576
I think that we would
really balance each other.

363
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,845
I mean, he really is
everything I've ever wanted.

364
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,847
It's so nice out tonight.

365
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,649
- That's what's so good here.

366
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:06,552
Today was definitely amazing.

367
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,522
Like, there's real
feelings here.

368
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,458
I think like each date
that we have together

369
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:15,761
deepens my feelings for Gabby.

370
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,030
I feel like we're heading
in the right direction.

371
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,765
- This is us.

372
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,335
- I know.
This is actually nice.

373
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,037
But I haven't really
been able to like

374
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,374
put it all out on the table
so that she knows

375
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,709
exactly where I stand.

376
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,544
- Thank you.

377
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,245
- I just wanna be
up-front with her

378
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,682
and let her know that I'm
not ready to get engaged.

379
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,787
Being authentic
and transparent with Gabby

380
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,990
is all I wanna do.

381
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,026
And yeah, tonight I think will
be the first time that like

382
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,295
I can really share where I'm at.

383
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:50,763
- Thank you for today.

384
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,299
- Oh, thank you. It was fun.
- It was such a good day.

385
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,767
- Cheers.

386
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,736
I don't know.
Like, I'm just kind of curious

387
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:01,641
what she's gonna say
and, um, how she'll take it.

388
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:05,645
Like, hopefully...
Hopefully well.

389
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:09,682
Yeah, today was... it was fun.

390
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,818
Like I was... first day that like

391
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,920
felt like totally normal
and like

392
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,122
a real day outside of this.

393
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,523
- Yeah.

394
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,859
- I felt like I was like
fully present the entire time

395
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,628
and like not thinking about
like everything going on

396
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,930
and it just felt good, so...

397
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,332
- No, yeah. Me too.

398
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,702
I feel like we can
kind of do anything,

399
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,038
but today was like so easy.

400
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,808
- Yeah. Um, I think it's...

401
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,045
Yeah, it's never... it's never
been easy for me here, but...

402
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,414
- Yeah. No, totally.

403
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,950
How has your time been
like after seeing your family?

404
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,286
And it's like a weird
transition, I feel.

405
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,688
- Yeah.

406
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,524
Seeing my family was...
It was great, you know.

407
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,693
But it's such a short time
to see them

408
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,997
and then you obviously
wanna like keep that going,

409
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,541
but then you come back
here and like...

410
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,868
It's kind of like a tease.
- Yeah.

411
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,713
- And then like I came here
and like was spending

412
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,505
like a week just like...
- By yourself.

413
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,674
- Kind of by myself.
- Yeah, I know.

414
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,811
- And just like wanting to
like... looking forward to today.

415
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,612
- Yeah.
- Yeah, this...

416
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,515
I think I've kind of told you
how like crazy

417
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,118
and weird this has been for me,
but like,

418
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:23,422
it actually has like...
It's been so challenging

419
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,357
in so many ways but, um...

420
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,928
- I think it just speaks a lot
about like your character

421
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,330
and that you do know
yourself and like it's okay

422
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,465
to be uncomfortable here.

423
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,367
And I'm so happy
you're still here.

424
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,137
And it means like so much to me.

425
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,244
- Honestly, this whole time
I've just tried to focus

426
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,208
on you and like me and you.

427
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:46,178
And it's kinda all that matters
to me, but, uh...

428
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,481
Yeah, I think obviously tonight,

429
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,616
like I wanted to talk to you
kind of just like

430
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,652
how I'm feeling and stuff
and I wanna be fully honest

431
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,388
and transparent
'cause that's kind of like

432
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,791
what I have wanted to do
this entire time.

433
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:04,063
And, um, you know, obviously
I do know that I'm into you

434
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,234
and like I... when I'm with you,
I feel, um,

435
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,003
like I'm having
some of the best days ever.

436
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,340
And I know like
what the expectation of this is

437
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,977
for, you know, a lot of people,
is like being engaged

438
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,745
and like being fully in love
and like...

439
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,413
- Yeah.

440
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,649
- To be like completely
transparent and honest,

441
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:26,218
I-I don't think
I'm fully there yet.

442
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,224
Um, I think it's
because in this environment,

443
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,595
like it's like constantly
in my head,

444
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,330
like what's real,
what's not real?

445
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,366
I'm like... I'm like questioning
so many things.

446
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:46,472
Yeah, I just... I don't
think in another seven days

447
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,140
I'll be ready for... for that.

448
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,543
Like, it's just not something
like in my heart

449
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:54,079
that feels right.

450
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,081
And I just wanna be
like fully transparent

451
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,083
and let you know how I feel.

452
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:07,026
- I know... honestly, like
I know how hard it is for you.

453
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:11,630
And I know it's like
a big expectation and...

454
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:15,634
but I don't also know,
like if you're,

455
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:16,981
I guess, at a place in your life

456
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,537
where you can see me

457
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:21,607
like with you at all
in the future

458
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,043
or like what?

459
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,746
- It's so hard for me
to like see that right now

460
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,682
within this bubble
because like I feel like

461
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,084
you don't even know who I am
completely.

462
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:36,288
And like I don't fully feel
like I know who you are.

463
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,425
Yeah, I would love to kind of
like hear how you feel too.

464
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,060
- Yeah.

465
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:46,966
Um, I think obviously, like...

466
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,937
I think... yeah, I think there's
honestly like a part of you

467
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:54,740
that has to decide whether,

468
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:59,111
um, you're like able

469
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:06,118
to believe in kind of this
like hopeless romanticism.

470
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:10,222
- For me, I'm more of a realist.

471
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,958
I don't think it's like
this is not real,

472
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:17,830
but like, it's been hard for me
to like feel at ease

473
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,399
with cameras
and microphones and stuff.

474
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:22,601
But yeah.

475
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:25,871
- Yeah, I know.

476
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:34,880
I think it's just like hard
'cause if you kind of feel

477
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,416
like you don't really know me,

478
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:40,386
how can you like really
make a promise?

479
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,754
Like...
- Yeah.

480
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:13,552
He was always someone
I saw myself with,

481
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,020
from the very beginning.

482
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:19,525
So to wait this long
to hear where he's at,

483
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,360
like definitely hurts.

484
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:23,195
It's just like...

485
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:27,900
I guess that there was
a piece of me that wanted him

486
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,869
to play along for like
just a second,

487
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,838
but he can't.

488
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:37,443
I just like knew
it was gonna happen.

489
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:43,182
Like I have to be honest
with myself, you know.

490
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,551
Maybe it just is,
you know, a love

491
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,120
that's not destined
to be together.

492
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:08,907
- Tonight at dinner, a lot
of things were said to me.

493
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,543
Jason said he's highly
uncomfortable here.

494
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,447
And he said that he's
not ready for a proposal.

495
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,685
It would've been good
to know before now.

496
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,591
Unlike, you know, other people
who can kind of

497
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,726
be themselves fully,
like he can't.

498
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:30,029
And it's a huge disadvantage
for him,

499
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:33,232
and I don't know
like why we're here

500
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:37,436
together if it's that hard.

501
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:42,574
But this is where we're
at, so I don't know.

502
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,854
- I just feel upset.

503
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,357
I'm just trying
to stay true to myself

504
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:02,428
and like it's obvious she was
upset about what I told her.

505
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,330
- Yeah. Are you okay?

506
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,900
- I don't... I don't know.

507
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:11,870
- I definitely don't wanna
like just walk away from this.

508
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:15,107
Like I truly feel like a unique
connection to her and like,

509
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,776
I just wanna be sure
she knows how I feel.

510
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:26,418
This is truly, I can't tell you
how challenging

511
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:27,485
this has been for me.

512
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,354
Like I was about to go home.

513
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,623
Like you are the reason
I stayed.

514
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,894
Like I'm literally here
for you, and I'm serious.

515
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:39,498
Like, I wouldn't be here
if you weren't here.

516
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:43,635
Yeah, today was like
a really special day

517
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:47,773
that I truly felt like
was just a big step

518
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,710
in our relationship
and something

519
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,245
that I think we can
really build on.

520
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,983
And I'm excited for that if
I can get the chance, so...

521
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,485
- I don't know.

522
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,420
There's just like
a part of me that's like,

523
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:05,124
are we like pulling at strings
kinda?

524
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:10,596
- No. I think like,
I totally see us getting

525
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,331
to a point like in real life,

526
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:16,335
like where we can
spend time together.

527
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:20,672
- I just don't know.

528
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,774
I don't know.

529
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:29,114
- Like, I truly feel like
a unique connection to you

530
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:32,718
that I haven't in a while
and like, when I'm with you,

531
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,787
like, I do feel good
about this, and like

532
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,323
I see that as something special

533
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,561
that could turn into
like a serious relationship.

534
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:46,698
And like, hopefully,
that by the end of this,

535
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,201
like that's where we're at.

536
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:52,104
And I truly care about you too
and like you truly

537
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:56,708
like mean a lot to me, yeah.

538
00:27:57,743 --> 00:28:00,712
I see, like in you,
like somebody that kind of

539
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,115
just gets it.

540
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,829
- I'm feeling conflicted.

541
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:20,766
I think now
I have to decide like,

542
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:24,636
whether it's worth
moving forward or not.

543
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:29,875
Jason did tell me like
he can see a future with me.

544
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:31,443
I don't wanna say goodbye to him

545
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,846
because I'm not ready
'cause I know

546
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:38,817
what's in front of me
is so precious.

547
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,886
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

548
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:42,521
I don't know.
I truly just wanna know

549
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:45,991
like what you think
'cause like I do wanna

550
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,993
be on like the same page.

551
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,031
- I don't... I mean,
maybe I like appeared upset

552
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:57,002
because I do really care
for you and I didn't know

553
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:02,241
if that was maybe it for us.

554
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,844
Like I wasn't ready to like
say goodbye in that moment.

555
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,814
Then after talking to you more,

556
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,817
I don't think it was ever
for me like,

557
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,319
"He doesn't like
believe in me."

558
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:15,954
- I do really care
about you too.

559
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:17,689
And like I think
we do have like a really

560
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,158
solid foundation that
could build into something

561
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,060
outside of this.

562
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:27,065
I think being off camera
and like being,

563
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:33,071
you know, private in privacy
will help me like understand

564
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:36,708
like the situation
and like maybe

565
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,744
I can like hear you better

566
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,912
and like you can hear me better.

567
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,515
- I agree.
Like we do just need tonight.

568
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:44,850
Yeah.

569
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,486
- And it's just like
a night unlike any other

570
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,789
that you can truly just like
share things with each other

571
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:52,257
and really get
to know each other

572
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:56,495
in a way that isn't really
possible otherwise here, so...

573
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:59,931
- Do you want to like
spend the rest of the night

574
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:03,368
kind of trying
to figure this out?

575
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,771
Maybe.
- Yeah. I think that is...

576
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,874
All I want is just
like time to spend

577
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,812
with you that we can truly get
to know each other and um...

578
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:16,114
Yeah, in like
an intimate, private way.

579
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:20,018
That would be
the best thing ever, so...

580
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:22,054
- Me too.

581
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:33,131
Tonight, I do really wanna do
an overnight with him.

582
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:37,135
I know one night
can change everything,

583
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:41,707
so as much as everything is
working against us right now,

584
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,810
like what if we come out on top?

585
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,579
Then like nothing
could ever take us down.

586
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,886
This is nice.

587
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,622
I've never met anyone like him
and I might not

588
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,124
meet anyone like him again.

589
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,493
And I just still have
to figure it out.

590
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,029
- Cheers to this journey.

591
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:07,165
And I'm grateful for you
for staying true to yourself.

592
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,501
And I'm just trying
to stay true to myself too.

593
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,404
And I think that's all we can
ask from each other.

594
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,740
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

595
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:19,544
- Tonight we can truly share
our feelings with each other.

596
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,680
And then who knows what can
happen like the next day

597
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:23,582
and how things might change?

598
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,818
No, I know it like
hasn't been easy for you,

599
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,255
but we owe it to ourselves
to try and see it through

600
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:31,723
as much as we can.

601
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:41,333
A future with Jason
would be full of surprises.

602
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,237
He's so sensitive.
He's so warm.

603
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,472
I could tell just by
the way he looks at me

604
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,808
that he really cares about me.

605
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:53,645
He's especially guarded.

606
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:57,282
But days and nights
feel like years here.

607
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,751
One conversation
with Jason really

608
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:01,887
could change everything.

609
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:38,457
- Waking up,
I'm hurt and I'm devastated.

610
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,795
Last night with Jason,

611
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:46,064
once we got behind closed doors,

612
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:50,969
we were talking in circles
and couldn't agree

613
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:54,105
on like how things were gonna go

614
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,373
and if we needed more time.

615
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,376
And honestly, I was like
running out of patience.

616
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,316
I was like, "Maybe
it's just not meant to be."

617
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:07,152
And then he was like,
"Yeah, definitely."

618
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:10,455
Like when were you gonna
tell me that?

619
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,593
So, you know, I wanted to leave

620
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,394
and give it space.

621
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:20,765
Right before
I walked out the door,

622
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:25,470
he was like,
"Basically like this is it."

623
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,776
And as much as it hurts,

624
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:36,281
I know that I need
to say goodbye to Jason.

625
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,784
You know, I'm ready
for somebody to love me

626
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,320
the way that I love them.

627
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,894
Hi.

628
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,328
- Hi.

629
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:09,648
- Um, I think overall,

630
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,885
just like waking up
this morning,

631
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:16,888
I think my mind's
just kind of spinning.

632
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,090
Like really like,
what we were doing,

633
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,725
I guess, all of these weeks,

634
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:25,096
'cause you were willing
to be here and participate.

635
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:28,333
So I took that as like
you did at least

636
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,235
see it going somewhere
week after week.

637
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:36,174
But then last night it was
like, you're questioning,

638
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,710
you know, if this is real
and like you can't

639
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:40,879
see me in the outside world.

640
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:43,882
- Um, yeah.

641
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:48,453
It was... yeah,
incredibly tough for me.

642
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,790
And I truly needed that time
for me to realize like

643
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,259
this wasn't gonna work for us.

644
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:56,895
Um, yeah, I'm sorry.

645
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,732
I genuinely want
the best for you

646
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,401
and think you're an amazing
person, but I-I-I'm...

647
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,103
I'm really sorry.

648
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,506
- You... like, you honestly like
don't have to apologize

649
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,176
or say things like you think
I'm an amazing person

650
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,645
'cause it doesn't like...

651
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,149
Like lessen the blow, I guess.

652
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,819
I wanna be with someone
and with someone

653
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,521
who's ready to be with me
and no questions asked,

654
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,423
and that's not us.

655
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,360
So like,
you don't have to say sorry.

656
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:29,427
- Okay.
- I get it.

657
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,296
- Yeah. I don't know.

658
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:34,299
I was just trying...
Fighting for it

659
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:36,067
and trying to like see...

660
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,870
- I don't know if like you
were really fighting though.

661
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:43,808
I think I was and you were
like following my lead.

662
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,978
It's like, I think you're
like so terrified to hurt me.

663
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:48,880
You've been treading so lightly,

664
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:52,083
but it's like
you knew how you feel

665
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,887
and like couldn't tell me.

666
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:58,857
- And I'm sorry like
that it happened like that,

667
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:04,329
but I got that clarity
when we were up there.

668
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:06,131
- It's okay.
You don't... like really,

669
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,866
I'm not looking
for you to apologize.

670
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:11,569
Like I truly
just want you to realize,

671
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:16,041
you know, I've been led on.
- Yeah.

672
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:22,447
- So... but, um...

673
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,986
Yeah. I-I don't think
I have really anything else

674
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:30,488
left to say.

675
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:35,360
I think that's it.
- Yeah.

676
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,963
- Yeah. Okay.

677
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:18,536
It's like I feel so stupid.

678
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:30,281
I thought I knew him,
but like, I really don't.

679
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,421
I've tried so hard to not be
reckless with other people,

680
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:40,959
and he was reckless with me.

681
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:52,804
He never loved me.

682
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,776
So what were we doing?

683
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:10,522
It's not even that he
didn't want an engagement.

684
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:13,258
He didn't want me.

685
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,576
How do you just keep trusting?

686
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:35,146
Johnny also doesn't want me.

687
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,420
Is it me?

688
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:47,692
I just don't know
what it is about me

689
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:51,696
that's so hard to love.

690
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,499
I'm terrified.

691
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:58,236
Like, what if Erich decides
I'm not for him?

692
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:07,045
Am I too broken
for anyone to love?

693
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,351
It does take the right person

694
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:14,886
to know how to love me,

695
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:17,689
and they might not be here.

696
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,243
- It feels really exciting to be

697
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,144
at this point in my journey.

698
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:44,082
So far, my overnight week
has been a dream.

699
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,451
It is so gorgeous
here in Mexico,

700
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,753
and I'm so close
to an engagement.

701
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,088
It's incredible.

702
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,959
Having this uninterrupted time
is just really huge for me

703
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:57,896
to gain clarity
on who I wanna spend

704
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,364
the rest of my life with.

705
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,099
There was Aven,

706
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,701
who was my first overnight
of this week.

707
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,604
I think it went so well.

708
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:08,573
It was a good night.
- It was a great night.

709
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,308
- I am falling in love with you.

710
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,343
- I'm falling in love with you
deeper.

711
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,179
- We were really able to get
to know each other deeper

712
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,448
and see that we have
a great connection.

713
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,517
- This is so rad.

714
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:23,588
- And then my next overnight
with Tino was so perfect.

715
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:25,690
- My heart's a little bit
in my throat saying this,

716
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,992
but I love you, Rachel.

717
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,461
- I love you too.

718
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,130
I really do.

719
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:35,300
Felt so amazing to hear him
say he's in love with me,

720
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,935
and to say it back.

721
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,072
I'm excited
to have my last overnight date

722
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,373
with Zach today.

723
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,076
We had such a great Hometown.

724
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,879
He told me he was
in love with me,

725
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,648
and I'm falling
in love with him too.

726
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:52,884
So I am a little bit freaked out

727
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:56,554
because I have three
incredible guys,

728
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,957
and in ten days,
there's gonna be one.

729
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,325
Hi.

730
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,327
- Hello.
- How are you doing?

731
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:05,229
So hopefully I can put
my nerves aside today

732
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,465
and have an amazing day
with Zach.

733
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:09,634
- You look beautiful.
- How are you?

734
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,338
How are you? Oh.

735
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,772
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

736
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,808
- Good to see you.

737
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,843
Welcome to Puerto Morelos.

738
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,546
This is my first time in Mexico.

739
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:26,017
We're gonna have a really fun
day on the town and explore.

740
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,352
What do you say?
- I can't wait.

741
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,418
Let's do it.
- You ready?

742
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:29,587
- Let's do it.

743
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,889
- Zach is everything that I want

744
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,224
in a partner.

745
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,759
I don't even have a question,

746
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,227
"Would Zach get down
on one knee?"

747
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:37,528
or "Is Zach ready?"

748
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:38,763
'Cause I know he is.

749
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,632
We're gonna go in here.
- Interesting.

750
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,802
- The last time I saw Zach was
in Anaheim for his Hometown

751
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,905
and I definitely see myself

752
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,807
being a part of his family
for sure.

753
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,042
Cheers.
- Cheers.

754
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:54,145
- Because of all the families,

755
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:57,315
his family was honestly
the most welcoming.

756
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:58,983
You have to drink all.

757
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,718
Yes, fill the tequila.
- Okay.

758
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:02,587
- Okay.
- You have to kiss the tequila.

759
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,322
- Kiss it.
- Just a little.

760
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:05,423
- Just a little?
- Yes.

761
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:11,262
- So good.

762
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:12,930
Very good.

763
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:13,931
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

764
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:14,932
- It's a pleasure.

765
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:18,202
- That's dangerous. Oh, yeah.

766
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,239
So you got to meet with
my dad, talk about planes.

767
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:24,008
- Mm-hmm.
We had the best time.

768
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:25,819
I feel like I fit in
perfectly in this family.

769
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,945
- You're welcome.
That was a fun day.

770
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,380
You survived it, you know.

771
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:30,882
- And your house
is so beautiful.

772
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,216
- Thank you.

773
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,819
- Truly your backyard
is like my dream backyard.

774
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,522
- It was, you know, like
the summer go-to hangout spot.

775
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:38,999
- I was gonna say
your house had to be.

776
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,292
I imagine your mom had
to make so many meals for all

777
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,960
of your friends growing up.
- So many.

778
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,629
So many pizzas
that have been ordered.

779
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,431
My dad just at the grill.
- Yeah.

780
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,400
Your mom seems like,
oh, my gosh,

781
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:51,335
just, she is such an angel.

782
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,570
So sweet.

783
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:55,039
And like the way
she talks about your dad.

784
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:57,442
They talk about each other
the exact same way.

785
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:00,211
- They're very much still
in love like the day they met.

786
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:01,612
- Aw, I love that.

787
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,082
- They just went
on like a however long

788
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,084
road trip together,
and my mom said,

789
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,227
you know, "Me and your father

790
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,953
"just were on a 20-day road trip

791
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,390
in an RV
and we didn't fight once."

792
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:14,334
And she's like, "We've been
married for almost 30 years."

793
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,158
And I was like,
"That's what I'm looking for."

794
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:17,304
- My parents have been
fighting the whole time.

795
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:18,696
- No.
- Well, not fighting,

796
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,207
but they like,
the way they communicate

797
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:21,966
is by like raising their voice.

798
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:24,035
- Gotcha. I don't think
I've ever raised my voice.

799
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,970
No one in my family
raises voices.

800
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:27,205
- Oh.

801
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,073
- I don't think
I've ever raised my voice

802
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,642
ever in an argument.
- Really?

803
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:35,113
You have such
a like striking voice.

804
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,215
- Booming.
- Booming. Yeah.

805
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,384
Can you try to speak
in a high-pitch voice?

806
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,321
Is this high enough for you?

807
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:55,976
- That was the worst thing
I ever heard.

808
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,235
- Isn't it?

809
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,836
When I'm with Rachel,
everything is

810
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:01,539
just so bright and fun and easy.

811
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:03,741
And that's
a pretty great feeling.

812
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,176
Oh, hot.

813
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:07,545
- It's kind of coastal grandma.

814
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:10,047
- We have, you know,
no like rhyme or reason

815
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,516
for anything we do or say

816
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,084
because we just get each other.

817
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,552
- Ooh, that could be us.

818
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:15,920
Could be a dead couple.

819
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,989
- We're just doing fun stuff,
which is

820
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,690
kind of how I operate.

821
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,526
What is that one?
- Ooh, that's a big one.

822
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,428
- You can eat it?
- You wanna try?

823
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,429
- What kind of a bug is that?

824
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,430
- Grasshopper.

825
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,565
- We have to eat the bug.

826
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:28,632
- Here, I got you.

827
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:32,403
Mmm.

828
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,906
I mean, there's no way it's...
These are good luck.

829
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,307
It tastes like a chip.

830
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:37,975
- Ooh.
- Mmm.

831
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,853
- I'm having an amazing time
with Rachel today.

832
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,946
I mean, everything you could
ever ask for in Mexico,

833
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,047
we're doing it.

834
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,749
- And now you're
gonna buy me a ring.

835
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,517
- I'm feeling confident
that the love

836
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:47,584
has just been growing.

837
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:48,819
Oh, oh.
- Oh.

838
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,688
- And that she can
without a doubt,

839
00:44:50,755 --> 00:44:52,356
see a future with me
as a spouse.

840
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:54,492
'Cause I'm feeling it.
And I think she's feeling it.

841
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,027
But on the flip side...

842
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:02,366
- Hmm.

843
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,101
- The thought does
constantly creep up

844
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,046
like, oh, you know, there's
other relationships,

845
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,738
you know, being formed here.

846
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,473
That's not a fun
and easy thought.

847
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:30,695
- Hmm.

848
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:31,838
The reading was saying that

849
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,998
I'm worried about the past,

850
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,633
and to not worry about the past

851
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,135
because the future is positive.

852
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,605
And I feel like I've definitely
been worrying about the past

853
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,139
because of what happened

854
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,741
when I was in this position
last time.

855
00:45:43,808 --> 00:45:46,010
The day Clayton told me
to go home,

856
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:49,547
I was just so heartbroken
and so blindsided.

857
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:52,550
And now I'm in a position
where someone can get hurt.

858
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,454
I love Mariachi.

859
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:03,494
- Zach has kind of
been killing it today.

860
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:06,497
We have a great time every
single time we're together.

861
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:10,201
And the relationship between
Zach and I is really powerful,

862
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,404
and he loves me
and wants to take care of me.

863
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:19,076
But with Tino and Aven,
I also have

864
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:22,246
such an incredible connection,
so I'm just struggling.

865
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:25,716
It's like a lot harder
than I ever thought.

866
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,886
And I think people can't
even begin to understand

867
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,621
how much stress I'm under,

868
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:33,190
because how do I even get
to a point emotionally

869
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,726
where I can break up
with any of these men

870
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:39,196
who are the most incredible
men I've ever met?

871
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:41,532
I'm very confused right now.

872
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,681
- Isn't this tree so pretty?

873
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,416
- This is so nice.
- I know.

874
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,319
- And it's breezy.
- I know.

875
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:03,287
We kind of match too.

876
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:06,524
Yeah, got some style.

877
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:09,794
After today's date
and during today's date,

878
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,696
from what I could tell
from Rachel,

879
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,998
I like to think I'm the one

880
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:15,666
that's gonna be here at the end,

881
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,168
you know, proposing to her.

882
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,704
And I'm feeling
more than excited.

883
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,273
Wow.
- It's so beautiful.

884
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,210
- With Fantasy Suites, tonight
is just another opportunity

885
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:29,380
to build on the relationship
that we have,

886
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:31,682
where there are no cameras
and it is private.

887
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:34,251
And we can talk about
everything and anything.

888
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:35,953
I already see a future,

889
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:40,458
because I love this woman,
and I want to be with her

890
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,326
for the rest of my life.

891
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:44,829
Cheers to all the memories

892
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,295
you and I have shared
to this point.

893
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,832
- Mm-hmm.
- That's the fun,

894
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:51,135
the laughter, and the dancing
to Mariachi music.

895
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,537
So cheers to many more to come.

896
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,473
- Cheers.

897
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,308
Not to Mariachi.

898
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,813
- I truly had no idea
how to dance to that.

899
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,324
- I don't even know
if there's a way to.

900
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:05,616
- Exactly.

901
00:48:05,683 --> 00:48:08,386
And then what'd you think
about the psychic?

902
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:09,452
- That's right.

903
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:10,821
The tarot card reader.
- Yeah.

904
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,289
- Well, that was
the first time I've

905
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,125
ever done something like that.
- Mm-hmm.

906
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:17,428
What'd you feel about it?
- I like what it said.

907
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:18,963
I don't know.
What did you think?

908
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,298
- Well, I actually wanted
to like talk to you about that.

909
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,300
I don't know
if today you noticed

910
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:25,202
I was a little bit off.

911
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,071
I hope you didn't.

912
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:31,442
But what she said was there was
a lot of like fear of the past

913
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:33,010
and a lot of like challenges.

914
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:35,780
And like right now, I really
feel like that is true.

915
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,248
- Yeah.

916
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:41,385
- I have struggled with
the feelings I felt last time

917
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:44,255
being like almost bleeding
into this week

918
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:45,561
and kind of tainting this week.

919
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:46,824
- Mm-hmm.

920
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:49,493
- No matter how happy
and how excited I am,

921
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,329
especially to have you here
and to be doing all this,

922
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:55,533
I think I do have those fears
of like still failure

923
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,103
and being blindsided
and leaving here alone,

924
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,605
because this is the point
in my own journey

925
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,741
where things started
to go really bad.

926
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:07,278
So like, I'm really just
trying my best to remember,

927
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,313
like she said,
that this isn't the past.

928
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,624
Like the psychic,
she literally said,

929
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:12,450
she's like,
"This isn't the past."

930
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:14,618
This is like
kind of a new journey.

931
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,353
And this is your future.

932
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,156
And you obviously make me feel
so safe.

933
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:22,460
And I'm so thankful that you
are here because, you know,

934
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,995
I do see a future with you.

935
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:27,765
- Well, I want you to know
that, you know,

936
00:49:27,832 --> 00:49:31,569
you... you didn't show it
but it's okay if you did.

937
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,905
Because I couldn't imagine,
you know,

938
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,007
what you were going through
last year

939
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:38,576
with what Clayton had done.

940
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,979
And that was obviously
the worst thing a man can do.

941
00:49:42,046 --> 00:49:45,015
And I just want you to know
that I don't wanna

942
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:48,486
ever put you in
an uncomfortable position.

943
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:51,422
I know you're feeling a lot
of anxiety from, you know,

944
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,292
the past and this,
and I don't wanna make that,

945
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,094
you know, heightened.

946
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,295
I wanna be there for you.

947
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,664
I wanna just enjoy
this time with you,

948
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:04,969
because I have these incredibly
strong feelings for you.

949
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:07,004
I'm in love with you,

950
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:08,472
and going into a night like this

951
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:12,576
where, you know, what's to come
is what excites me.

952
00:50:17,715 --> 00:50:19,583
Obviously we all know
how things went down

953
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,085
with Clayton last season.

954
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:24,021
And the last thing I'd ever want

955
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:25,990
is for the woman
I love and care for

956
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:30,661
to feel like she's not being
watched out for and protected.

957
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:33,898
And so I want her to know
that she can always be,

958
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:35,833
you know, safe with me.

959
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,435
- I have something for you.
- Oh.

960
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:39,670
- Do you wanna read it?

961
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:41,505
- I would love to.

962
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:47,711
"Rachel and Zach,
I hope you enjoyed your day

963
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:50,281
"in Puerto Morelos.

964
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:52,316
"What could be better
than a little tequila

965
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,218
"and a glimpse into your future?

966
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:56,487
"And by the way,
you better have brought

967
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,255
some of that tequila back
for me."

968
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,693
"Should you choose to forgo
your individual rooms,

969
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,362
"please use this key
to spend the night together

970
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:07,932
in the Fantasy Suite. Jesse."

971
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:09,899
And here is the key.

972
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:10,834
- Yeah.

973
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,370
So what do you think?

974
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:17,708
- I think I would love
the opportunity

975
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:21,312
to spend the Fantasy Suite
with you tonight.

976
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,225
- Let's do it.

977
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:44,468
- I think after today's date,
I'm more than confident

978
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:46,837
Rachel and I's future
only looks bright.

979
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:48,005
It was incredible.

980
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:51,041
So tonight will be the night

981
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,410
Rachel and I will have answers.

982
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:59,883
- Wow.
- Oh, my gosh.

983
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:05,155
- Isn't this so pretty?
- Wow.

984
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:06,924
I'm in love with his woman.

985
00:52:06,991 --> 00:52:10,394
And I want tonight to be
where we can talk

986
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:11,829
about the really important
stuff.

987
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,466
- Gosh.
- What a room.

988
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,635
- This is so beautiful.

989
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:20,070
- In the morning,
I'm expecting to feel

990
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,640
more in love
with future Mrs. Shallcross.

991
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:29,313
- And nothing coming out
of tonight can change that.

992
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,963
- Do you put limes on fruit?

993
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,390
They have some limes.
- I think so.

994
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:50,000
- Or should we
just eat the lime?

995
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:51,444
- Do you want that?
Oh, what's that, yogurt?

996
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:53,504
- I think.

997
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:54,605
Do you wanna drink it?

998
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:57,608
It's good for you.

999
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:01,879
- Cheers.
- Pretty strong.

1000
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,113
Cheers.

1001
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:09,520
Ah.

1002
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:11,746
- That's some good... some
good cup of joe right there.

1003
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:13,490
- Do you think it's good?

1004
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:14,658
- Yeah.

1005
00:53:14,725 --> 00:53:17,227
- Really?
I mean, it's kinda bitter.

1006
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:20,364
- I love it when you can
just taste the beans.

1007
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:22,866
Like you just chewed them up?

1008
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:28,105
I'm ready for bed.
I'm like so tired.

1009
00:53:28,172 --> 00:53:30,641
We didn't sleep, right?
We went to bed so late.

1010
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,509
- So late.

1011
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:34,878
I mean, we did have a big night.

1012
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,513
- Mm-hmm.

1013
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,183
- We talked about
a lot of things.

1014
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:42,686
- Yeah.

1015
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:46,223
It was like
a tough conversation, but...

1016
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,891
- Mm-hmm.

1017
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,127
- I'm glad you handled it well,

1018
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:55,099
and hopefully it helped,
you know, gain clarity.

1019
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:56,400
- Gain clarity.

1020
00:53:56,467 --> 00:53:57,835
- Clarity.

1021
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,007
- You're feeling okay, honestly?

1022
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,876
- It's a lot to digest.
- Yeah, for sure.

1023
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:08,212
- 'Cause we did cover a lot
and, you know,

1024
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:09,589
a proposal is right
around the corner.

1025
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:11,749
- For sure.
- You know?

1026
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:14,318
- But, you know,

1027
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:17,855
I'm here for a reason and...

1028
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,190
you know,
you're that reason, so...

1029
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,392
- So I hope
we're on the same page.

1030
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:23,761
- I think we are.
- Okay.

1031
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,229
- I think we are.

1032
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:30,000
- Waking up this morning,

1033
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:34,404
I'm feeling a little confused

1034
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:36,840
after last night.

1035
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:39,009
Fantasy Suite night with Rachel

1036
00:54:39,076 --> 00:54:43,313
was not the night I expected.

1037
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,449
Initially in the
Fantasy Suite, you know,

1038
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:47,718
I was feeling so sure.

1039
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:50,454
We're having this amazing time
and we're one step closer

1040
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:54,024
to engagement and we're having
that important conversation

1041
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:58,295
about religion, politics,
all of that stuff.

1042
00:54:58,362 --> 00:55:00,631
And Rachel brought up
her fear that

1043
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,699
maybe I'm not ready
for a commitment like marriage

1044
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:04,601
at this early of an age.

1045
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:06,537
- Well, I'll see you soon.

1046
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:08,272
- Bye, beautiful.
- Bye.

1047
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:10,007
- See you real soon.
- See you later.

1048
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:11,008
- I'll see you soon.

1049
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,242
- Bye.
- Bye.

1050
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,977
And I was like,
"Don't worry about that.

1051
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,379
I'm here for you."

1052
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,616
But then she got really adamant.

1053
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:22,486
Like, "Are you ready?
Like, are you sure?

1054
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:25,222
Are you sure?"
And I was like...

1055
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:27,791
"Are you making me
like second guess?"

1056
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:29,827
That was a surprise.

1057
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:34,698
It was like we
were two strangers.

1058
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:36,033
I don't know what it could be,

1059
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:39,703
but Rachel's concern
came outta nowhere.

1060
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:42,439
And I think...

1061
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:45,609
it's, to be honest,

1062
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:49,179
And she was putting on a front.

1063
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:51,548
That scares me.

1064
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:53,684
That scares me a lot.

1065
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,835
Jesse.
- Zach.

1066
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:13,270
What's up, man?

1067
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:15,906
- Can we talk?
- Uh, yeah, come on in.

1068
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:17,641
Have a seat.
- Thank you.

1069
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:30,254
- What's going on?
Are you okay?

1070
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,556
Excuse me.

1071
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:33,957
- Yeah.
Take your time, man.

1072
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:48,205
- Things are obviously
taking a turn.

1073
00:56:48,272 --> 00:56:49,573
- Yeah.

1074
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:54,077
To be honest, I'm
completely lost right now.

1075
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:58,849
Every moment
that Rachel and I shared,

1076
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,284
from the moment we met

1077
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:04,554
to the moment
we had our one-on-ones,

1078
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:08,725
I mean, everything
was just so easy, fun.

1079
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:10,894
We clicked,
we had that connection

1080
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:14,498
and things were immediately
different

1081
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:16,166
when we were
in the Fantasy Suite.

1082
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:18,936
Just completely the
way we were together,

1083
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,804
you know, that feeling?

1084
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:23,774
Took like a 180 and you know,

1085
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,542
she was different,
I was different.

1086
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:29,579
And the strange thing
for me was, you know,

1087
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:34,451
when the cameras were away and
it was just her and I talking,

1088
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:38,355
it felt like she was just like
not showing her true self.

1089
00:57:38,422 --> 00:57:43,126
It was very
unauthentic sometimes.

1090
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:44,695
- Like, was it stuff
she was saying?

1091
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:47,564
Or was it like the tone
of the conversation?

1092
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:51,468
- Her major concern was my age.

1093
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:54,304
And she wasn't sure
if I was ready to commit

1094
00:57:54,371 --> 00:57:55,739
because I was 25.

1095
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,075
- And you're 25.
- And you're 26...

1096
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,176
- She's 26.

1097
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:00,353
- She's 26,
a couple months older.

1098
00:58:00,377 --> 00:58:04,748
And, uh, you know...

1099
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:05,959
I kind of felt
blindsided by that.

1100
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:09,486
You know, with proposals
around the corner,

1101
00:58:09,553 --> 00:58:12,322
that was the last thing
I could have ever expected.

1102
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:16,326
Like I thought I saw my future,
you know, with this woman.

1103
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:20,397
And...

1104
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:24,968
when I was there, it was
hard to rationalize, you know,

1105
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:26,035
what was going on.

1106
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:28,238
And...

1107
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:31,641
I was praying 'cause
I thought I had something.

1108
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,744
I thought I saw
this future with her

1109
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,645
and just to be completely

1110
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:38,415
gut-punched
and not feeling it at all.

1111
00:58:38,482 --> 00:58:42,119
- Zach, I am so sorry,

1112
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,755
because I know that's
not what you were expecting.

1113
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:47,824
- You know, there were quite a
bit of times where I was like,

1114
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:51,795
she could be my future wife.

1115
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:57,134
And you know, you play it in
your head, and it's exciting.

1116
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,568
And you think that, you know,

1117
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:01,238
this week is like
the natural progression

1118
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:02,539
to make that a reality.

1119
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:06,109
And I learned it wasn't

1120
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:10,847
and, uh, it's shock.

1121
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:13,950
I'm sad 'cause there's
feelings for her,

1122
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:17,421
but I need to figure this out
as soon as I can,

1123
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:19,589
because we made it this far.

1124
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:23,360
And how am I gonna recover
from this, you know?

1125
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:27,431
And, I don't know.

1126
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,169
I don't know how
to go about it right now.

1127
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,238
Like, she met my family.

1128
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:41,178
And they saw something.

1129
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,380
- God, I'm sorry, man.
- It's all good.

1130
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:44,447
It's okay.

1131
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:54,658
- Sounds like you really
care a lot about her.

1132
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:58,261
- Yeah.
- What do you wanna do?

1133
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:00,997
- I need to tell her.

1134
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:03,100
- And she needs
to see this side of you.

1135
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,035
- Yeah.

1136
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:06,970
- Okay.

1137
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:11,842
- Tonight's the Rose Ceremony
and uh, it's tough because

1138
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:13,577
Rachel, I know would love like...

1139
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:16,413
I mean, I saw that woman
as my future wife.

1140
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,284
But it's made me wonder like if

1141
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:24,788
that's where her head's
at with me.

1142
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:30,060
The only thing left to do
is to talk to Rachel.

1143
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:38,435
I need answers to accept
the rose from Rachel.

1144
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:40,270
- I'm gonna whisper this
once, and only once.

1145
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,485
- I'm overwhelmed.

1146
01:00:55,552 --> 01:00:59,389
Going into this Rose Ceremony,
I'm ready to be done,

1147
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:00,991
especially after overnights.

1148
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:05,562
Erich is the only man
I have left.

1149
01:01:05,629 --> 01:01:09,666
I said goodbye
to Jason and Johnny.

1150
01:01:09,733 --> 01:01:12,335
I'm still kind of upset and sad

1151
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:15,572
and just processing
exactly what happened

1152
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:18,942
and how it affected me.

1153
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,353
And now it's right
in front of my face,

1154
01:01:20,377 --> 01:01:23,446
is my person might not be here.

1155
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,248
Not because
I don't want them to be.

1156
01:01:25,315 --> 01:01:28,685
Of course I do.

1157
01:01:28,752 --> 01:01:31,321
I want to be loved for who I am

1158
01:01:31,388 --> 01:01:34,057
and I know I just have to
continue to follow my heart,

1159
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:36,092
but now more than ever,

1160
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:40,697
I'm scared that
I could leave here alone.

1161
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,519
- I don't have any idea how
the Rose Ceremony's gonna go.

1162
01:02:02,586 --> 01:02:03,787
All I know is that

1163
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:05,531
my feelings towards Rachel
haven't changed.

1164
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:09,626
I definitely, you know,
I'm falling in love with her.

1165
01:02:09,693 --> 01:02:10,994
I love her as a person.

1166
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:13,330
I love the way
that she makes me feel.

1167
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:14,998
And I wanna be with her.

1168
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,102
I see myself with her
in the future.

1169
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:21,271
Starting life together,
getting married,

1170
01:02:21,338 --> 01:02:23,707
having kids and starting
a family, all of that stuff.

1171
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:26,009
I see that with her.

1172
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:27,677
Not getting a rose
would be really hard.

1173
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,614
It's her not seeing
a future with me

1174
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,983
and seeing a future
with two other people.

1175
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:34,618
And like, I really
do care for her a lot

1176
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:36,453
and I don't wanna like lose her.

1177
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,359
- I'm feeling very confident

1178
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,628
about my relationship
with Rachel.

1179
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,097
My Fantasy Suite
went so flawlessly.

1180
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:49,733
Like I can't imagine it
having gone any better.

1181
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:52,669
It was perfection.

1182
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:55,438
But it's still Rachel's choice.

1183
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:58,408
You know, I know
that she's really stressed

1184
01:02:58,475 --> 01:03:02,812
about how she was received
by my family.

1185
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:05,782
It was pretty hard for her.

1186
01:03:07,017 --> 01:03:08,418
I just see her as
like my future,

1187
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:10,120
and like,
if she doesn't see that back,

1188
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:12,856
like that would be pretty
like soul crushing.

1189
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,405
I'm feeling sick to my stomach.

1190
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:32,275
Tonight's Rose Ceremony feels

1191
01:03:32,342 --> 01:03:34,544
the complete opposite
of what have gone into

1192
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:36,746
every Rose Ceremony.

1193
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:40,517
I thought our connection
was the most strong.

1194
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,385
- Hey, Zach.
- Hey, Jesse.

1195
01:03:42,452 --> 01:03:44,287
- How you doing, man?
- I'm getting there.

1196
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:46,656
How are you feeling?

1197
01:03:46,723 --> 01:03:50,293
Um, sadness.
Kind of overwhelming.

1198
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:54,297
But before she gets the
opportunity to offer roses,

1199
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:55,398
I'd like to talk to her.

1200
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:56,785
- You think you
need that clarity?

1201
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,301
- I think so.
- All right.

1202
01:03:58,368 --> 01:03:59,402
I wish you the best, man.

1203
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:01,037
- Thank you, Jesse.
- Good luck.

1204
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:10,146
- Rachel made me feel special.

1205
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:16,586
And I felt like what
we shared was real.

1206
01:04:16,653 --> 01:04:21,858
Felt like the love was actually
forming and building

1207
01:04:21,925 --> 01:04:23,626
with her together,

1208
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:27,497
something that
I was totally buying into

1209
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:31,634
and...

1210
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:35,205
all of that went away
in one night.

1211
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:38,775
- Hey, Aven.
- How we doing?

1212
01:04:38,842 --> 01:04:39,919
- Good to see you again, man.
- Good to see you.

1213
01:04:39,943 --> 01:04:41,053
How you doing?
- How's everything?

1214
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:42,437
- Good, good.
It's been a fun week.

1215
01:04:42,479 --> 01:04:43,589
- What do you think
the overnight date did

1216
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:44,547
for your relationship together?

1217
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,116
I think it grew a lot.

1218
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:48,127
I think we were able to talk
about some really good stuff

1219
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:49,686
and spend some
really good quality time

1220
01:04:49,753 --> 01:04:51,688
to just kind of be ourselves,
and it was amazing.

1221
01:04:51,755 --> 01:04:53,099
- And are you falling
in love with her?

1222
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:54,057
- I am falling
in love with Rachel.

1223
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:55,792
- Wow.
- Yes, I know. Big.

1224
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:57,069
- I'm glad to hear you say that.

1225
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:58,404
Wish you all the best tonight.
- Me too, Jesse.

1226
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:00,308
It's good to see you.
- Take care, man. You too.

1227
01:05:07,137 --> 01:05:08,972
What's up?

1228
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:12,347
- How are you doing, man?
- How you doing?

1229
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:22,152
- Oh, yeah.

1230
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:23,286
Cooking.

1231
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:29,592
- Tino, what's up?

1232
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:30,899
- How's it going?
- How are you?

1233
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,228
- Not too shabby.
How about you?

1234
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:33,997
- Pretty good.

1235
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:35,398
You got a smile on your face.

1236
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:37,343
Looks like someone's overnight
date went pretty well.

1237
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:39,569
- Yeah, it was really fun.
- Tell me about it.

1238
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:41,204
- We took another gigantic leap

1239
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,939
and me and Rachel
told each other

1240
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:45,241
that we're in love with
each other and it was amazing.

1241
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:47,710
- So you're in love with her?
- Absolutely.

1242
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,979
Stronger after the
overnight portion, for sure.

1243
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:51,047
- Really?

1244
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:58,354
That night in Fantasy Suite,
I mean, the body language,

1245
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:01,591
the way that we both interacted,

1246
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:03,960
it felt like we
were two strangers.

1247
01:06:04,027 --> 01:06:05,962
We had like the most
inauthentic conversation

1248
01:06:06,029 --> 01:06:07,430
I've ever had.

1249
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:10,333
I felt like I wasn't
talking to the same Rachel.

1250
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,769
I mean, I'm terrified right now.

1251
01:06:12,836 --> 01:06:16,272
My heart's pounding
out of my chest.

1252
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:18,074
I'm not feeling okay...

1253
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:22,745
Because I do have
feelings for her.

1254
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,747
Like that just won't go away.

1255
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,349
I have to salvage what I have.

1256
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:28,852
I need to tell
Rachel how I feel.

1257
01:06:35,892 --> 01:06:37,193
- Hi, Jesse.
- Hello.

1258
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,028
- How are you?
- So good to see you.

1259
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:40,339
- So good to see you.
You look great.

1260
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:41,931
- You too.
You look amazing as always.

1261
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,299
- Thank you.
Thank you.

1262
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:44,601
- You got a beautiful smile.

1263
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:45,935
How's the week been?

1264
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,338
- It has been so incredible.

1265
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:51,841
I just really had the best time
with all three of these men.

1266
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:56,212
And a lot of clarity, a lot of,
you know, questions,

1267
01:06:56,279 --> 01:06:59,516
hard questions, but they
all definitely stepped up.

1268
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:00,617
- Right.

1269
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:01,994
And after this week,
you feel like

1270
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,920
there's a proposal
at the end of this for you?

1271
01:07:03,987 --> 01:07:06,256
- I really think
there might be a proposal.

1272
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:07,524
I'm hoping so.

1273
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,292
- I'm so happy
to hear you say that.

1274
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,803
Well, there is something
I do have to tell you.

1275
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:12,495
- Okay.

1276
01:07:12,562 --> 01:07:18,201
- Gabby will not be joining you
at this Rose Ceremony.

1277
01:07:18,268 --> 01:07:20,069
You're gonna be the
only Bachelorette here.

1278
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:21,838
- Okay.
- All right.

1279
01:07:21,905 --> 01:07:25,141
This Rose Ceremony
really is all about you

1280
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,410
and your relationships
with your men.

1281
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:29,746
You forged your own path,
your own journey,

1282
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:31,948
and tonight is really
all about that.

1283
01:07:32,015 --> 01:07:35,618
Gabby's on her journey,
and you're on your journey.

1284
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:37,887
- Ah, it's gonna be
so weird not having her here,

1285
01:07:37,954 --> 01:07:39,355
but I'm ready.

1286
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:40,924
- I know you are.

1287
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,059
All right, well,
your men are anxiously waiting.

1288
01:07:43,126 --> 01:07:44,327
- All right.
Thanks, Jesse.

1289
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,262
- I know it's a big one.
Good luck.

1290
01:07:46,329 --> 01:07:48,331
- Bye.

1291
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,733
- That was me.
I showed her who I was.

1292
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,370
I was more than ready
to get on one knee.

1293
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:55,605
The Rachel, you know,

1294
01:07:55,672 --> 01:07:57,774
that I was falling in love with,

1295
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,342
I trusted her, you know,

1296
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,678
at least to show me her real...
Her real self.

1297
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:02,904
And I don't think I got that.

1298
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:07,417
And I still don't
know why or how.

1299
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:10,186
What was that Rachel
that I was getting?

1300
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:12,789
That's the biggest concern
to me.

1301
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,324
So yeah, I'm upset.

1302
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:17,126
I can't just be here and
not share my feelings with her

1303
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:19,696
because I need answers.

1304
01:08:29,871 --> 01:08:31,541
- Hi, guys.

1305
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:35,577
It's so good to see all of you.

1306
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:37,479
I just wanted to say that

1307
01:08:37,547 --> 01:08:43,019
I truly had the most wonderful
week with all three of you.

1308
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:45,988
I'm so thankful
for you guys to be here.

1309
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:05,875
- Rachel, can we speak?

1310
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:08,044
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1311
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,752
- Oh. Why the heck?

1312
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,654
- Oh, my God.

1313
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:26,496
- I'm kind of still
conflicted and nervous,

1314
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:29,365
but today I do know
what I need to do.

1315
01:09:29,432 --> 01:09:32,602
And I just need to find Erich
and really tell him how I feel

1316
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:36,205
and lay everything out
on the table.

1317
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:39,442
I am scared that the
last conversation went awry

1318
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:42,310
and that we can't kind
of get back to that.

1319
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:46,749
I don't wanna play games.

1320
01:09:46,816 --> 01:09:48,751
I think I've like
worked really hard

1321
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:50,920
and have been honest
with myself and my feelings.

1322
01:09:50,987 --> 01:09:54,357
But I've been waiting
for the right moment

1323
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:57,427
and this is so clearly
the right moment.

1324
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,829
And now, I'm really
not afraid to say

1325
01:09:59,896 --> 01:10:03,766
that I do know what I deserve.

1326
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:20,216
- I'm getting ready for the
Rose Ceremony,

1327
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:24,219
and I'm afraid
that I might loser her.

1328
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:26,823
I am in love with Gabby,
and this whole process,

1329
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,325
I've kind of misjudged
from the start

1330
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:30,793
how hard it is on her.

1331
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,327
I brought something up that

1332
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:33,872
wasn't in the right place,
right time.

1333
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,641
And it's something we
had already talked about.

1334
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:37,767
And for me to just still
kind of harp on something

1335
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:40,002
that was bothering me,

1336
01:10:40,068 --> 01:10:41,471
I realize how
insensitive that is.

1337
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:45,975
And I don't know
what she's thinking.

1338
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,077
I'm sweating and I'm nervous
and I'm shaking

1339
01:10:48,144 --> 01:10:49,879
and I don't know what to do.

1340
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:58,955
- Right now, like,
I'm so scared.

1341
01:11:01,124 --> 01:11:03,626
In the end,
I deserve being with someone

1342
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:05,528
who isn't afraid to love me.

1343
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,633
Erich is the only man here

1344
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:13,169
and I think that's
what makes it more scary.

1345
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:18,674
I can't tolerate any more pain.

1346
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,443
And I know walking away from him

1347
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:23,579
would be what I need
to protect myself.

1348
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,784
I don't know what's
gonna happen.

1349
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,418
I can't predict anything.

1350
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:32,155
And I just... am gonna
have to see how I feel.

1351
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:38,795
If it's my decision to leave
here alone, I know it's mine.

1352
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:45,535
Hi.

1353
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:46,869
Hi.
- Hi.

1354
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:48,237
- How are you?
- Good.

1355
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,405
How are you?
- Good.

1356
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:50,983
- Surprised?
- I was not expecting you.

1357
01:11:51,007 --> 01:11:52,508
- You weren't?
- No.

1358
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:56,145
Oh, this is your outfit.

1359
01:11:56,212 --> 01:11:57,746
Um, how are you?

1360
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,115
- I'm good.
- Good.

1361
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:02,585
- Are you okay?

1362
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:04,020
- I'm just gonna jump right in.

1363
01:12:04,085 --> 01:12:05,221
- Yeah. Go ahead.

1364
01:12:05,288 --> 01:12:09,458
- Um, this week has
like been so crazy,

1365
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:14,197
um, and I think I've been
learning so much about myself

1366
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:16,599
literally every day
and every week.

1367
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:20,403
And, um, I knew it would
be hard, everything,

1368
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:22,349
but I honestly didn't know
it would be this hard

1369
01:12:22,405 --> 01:12:27,977
and I've been making decisions.

1370
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:29,679
You know, the situation

1371
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:33,416
when like you and I were
speaking last was like...

1372
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:35,785
Didn't...
I don't think go as planned.

1373
01:12:38,955 --> 01:12:41,724
It was just hard.
I don't know.

1374
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:45,728
I think we were like
misunderstanding each other.

1375
01:12:45,795 --> 01:12:50,499
Um, and I think I was so upset
'cause I was like,

1376
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:52,902
"Why doesn't he just
like trust us?"

1377
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:57,505
Going into, you know,
my date with Jason,

1378
01:12:57,573 --> 01:13:00,643
like I did just
need more clarity.

1379
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:04,313
Um, and I know
he's a private person,

1380
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:09,050
so I think
we just needed time alone.

1381
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:14,357
Um, and having our date
and our time together,

1382
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:18,227
it was the first time
I was able to like

1383
01:13:18,294 --> 01:13:23,165
come around to what
knowing what I deserve.

1384
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,606
But like, I know in my heart
that like you've fought for me

1385
01:13:30,673 --> 01:13:33,943
so much and you love
in this very secure

1386
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:36,245
and comfortable way.

1387
01:13:36,312 --> 01:13:38,648
Like you've taught me how
like I wanted to be treated

1388
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:41,784
and that's okay to like
ask for those things.

1389
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:44,654
You know, sometimes
it is hard for me

1390
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,391
to just like take
things at face value

1391
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:52,161
because of everything
that I've gone through.

1392
01:13:52,228 --> 01:13:54,463
But you have like
taught me that it's okay

1393
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:57,600
to feel safe and
wanted and loved

1394
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:59,602
in maybe a way that I haven't.

1395
01:13:59,669 --> 01:14:03,673
And you're the only one left.

1396
01:14:05,708 --> 01:14:06,909
I know it's like so hard

1397
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:08,353
and I think I've felt it
for a while,

1398
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:12,281
but I do know that I love you.

1399
01:14:12,348 --> 01:14:14,450
I love you.

1400
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:21,857
This is fricking amazing.

1401
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:23,626
I'm so happy right now.

1402
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:25,161
That's the best
feeling in the world.

1403
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:27,663
It's like,
all I wanted was this,

1404
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:29,465
and then you get it and it's...

1405
01:14:29,532 --> 01:14:31,567
I just couldn't be happier.

1406
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:33,736
And then anybody that I
connect with like so easily

1407
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:37,206
and like so deeply
right off the bat.

1408
01:14:37,273 --> 01:14:41,577
And then I got to know you more
and like about who you are

1409
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:43,946
and your family and
past relationships.

1410
01:14:44,013 --> 01:14:46,615
And your life hasn't been easy

1411
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:49,184
and it's made you just like
such an amazing woman.

1412
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:52,989
And I'm so freaking
lucky that it is you.

1413
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:57,559
- I've been waiting so long
to tell Erich how I feel.

1414
01:14:57,626 --> 01:15:01,831
He's been so vulnerable and
confident and secure with me.

1415
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:04,600
He's the best thing
that's ever happened to me

1416
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,802
and it feels so right.

1417
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:09,739
I do have like so many feelings.

1418
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:11,107
I'm able to get to this point

1419
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,175
'cause you've always
made me feel so safe.

1420
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:17,346
And I like, honestly,
never gotten it before.

1421
01:15:17,413 --> 01:15:19,315
It has like come from the past

1422
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:22,485
and not just like
with romantic relationships

1423
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:24,286
but in some other ones,

1424
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,789
just having like to ask
for those things.

1425
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:30,693
And you've never made me ask.

1426
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,629
I think I needed to like
process and come to it,

1427
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:35,865
you know, on my own terms
for it to like make sense

1428
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:38,634
'cause it is so foreign to me.

1429
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:49,412
- I love you, Gabby.

1430
01:15:52,448 --> 01:15:56,152
- I'm getting emotional.
- Okay.

1431
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,387
- And honestly,
it feels like a fairytale.

1432
01:15:58,454 --> 01:16:01,957
I just like can't believe
that he's all mine.

1433
01:16:02,023 --> 01:16:04,226
There's no point
in having a Rose Ceremony,

1434
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:06,395
and it's just you and me.

1435
01:16:06,462 --> 01:16:08,898
I like the sound of that.

1436
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:10,232
- Me too.

1437
01:16:12,934 --> 01:16:17,039
Erich is definitely
the love of my life.

1438
01:16:17,106 --> 01:16:21,010
I think everything in my life
has happened for a reason,

1439
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:24,980
and all of the arrows
and the stars

1440
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:27,716
are pointing straight to him.

1441
01:16:27,782 --> 01:16:32,021
It feels so good and it feels
so incredibly meant to be.

1442
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:33,621
I love you.

1443
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:36,659
I love you.

1444
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:39,295
I finally get to live
what I thought

1445
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:41,163
was only gonna be fantasy.

1446
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:43,299
Sometimes I'm like, pinch me,

1447
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:45,668
'cause it's way too good
to be true.

1448
01:16:51,507 --> 01:16:53,509
- Rachel, can we speak?
- Yeah.

1449
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,152
- Uh, um...

1450
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:07,865
- His look when he asked her
to walk out,

1451
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:10,793
he just looked like
pretty upset.

1452
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,829
- Yeah.
- Interesting.

1453
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:16,499
I guess he kinda saw it
as a now or never.

1454
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:35,351
- Hey, Jesse Palmer here.

1455
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:36,828
I know, look,
I know you're all expecting

1456
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:38,987
to watch the end of
that dramatic Rose Ceremony

1457
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:40,389
in Mexico right now and I know

1458
01:17:40,456 --> 01:17:43,025
you're all very anxious
and eager to find out

1459
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:45,460
what happens next,
but unfortunately,

1460
01:17:45,528 --> 01:17:46,896
you're not gonna
see that tonight

1461
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:48,464
and I'm very, very,
sorry for that.

1462
01:17:48,531 --> 01:17:50,799
Things have just been
so emotional,

1463
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:52,934
they've been so dramatic
for both Gabby and Rachel

1464
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:55,871
that we felt it was right
to take a moment

1465
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:59,808
and to prepare ourselves
for the shocking events

1466
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,343
that are about to take place,

1467
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:05,814
events that are gonna change
both Rachel's and Gabby's lives

1468
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,216
forever.

1469
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:09,818
So next week, we'll all watch

1470
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:13,689
the most emotional finale
in "Bachelorette" history,

1471
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:17,993
and it's gonna take place
right here on this stage live.

1472
01:18:18,059 --> 01:18:19,895
And we felt it was best to wait

1473
01:18:19,962 --> 01:18:23,332
until both Rachael and Gabby
and their men could be here

1474
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:24,700
to address all of the drama.

1475
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:26,802
And of course, we'll have our
live studio audience

1476
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:31,106
and you will all bear witness
to the crazy controversy

1477
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:33,375
that's about to ensue.

1478
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:36,912
So take some time
and get yourselves ready

1479
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:38,948
and prepare yourselves...

1480
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:43,452
for the most shocking finale
of all time.

1481
01:18:43,519 --> 01:18:44,987
Here's a sneak peek.

1482
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:52,928
- This is actually crazy.

1483
01:18:52,995 --> 01:18:55,264
I don't want to do this anymore.

1484
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:57,199
- Gabby.
- I want to leave here.

1485
01:18:57,266 --> 01:18:59,268
- For people who
say that they care about me

1486
01:18:59,335 --> 01:19:02,638
to question my character,
it's really disappointing.

1487
01:19:02,705 --> 01:19:05,907
This is straight-up
shattering everything

1488
01:19:05,975 --> 01:19:07,476
that you promised me.

1489
01:19:07,543 --> 01:19:08,477
- Next week...

1490
01:19:08,544 --> 01:19:10,346
- Breathe, okay?
You're okay.

1491
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:12,548
- The most emotional
and unpredictable

1492
01:19:12,615 --> 01:19:15,951
season finale
of all time begins.

1493
01:19:16,018 --> 01:19:17,886
- There's no way this works out.

1494
01:19:17,952 --> 01:19:19,592
Please just keep me out of this.

1495
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:21,090
Let me out.

1496
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:24,293
- We are literally about
to be engaged tomorrow.

1497
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,960
To our dream guys.

1498
01:19:26,028 --> 01:19:27,930
- Literally dreams.

1499
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:31,467
- Will Gabby and Rachel both
find the love they so deserve?

1500
01:19:31,532 --> 01:19:32,901
Hi!

1501
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:35,437
- I'm, like, really thankful
it's just us.

1502
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:37,339
- You think he's ready
to get down on a knee?

1503
01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:38,773
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1504
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:41,577
- I just love her.
I want the best for her.

1505
01:19:41,644 --> 01:19:43,545
- If you think
you know what happens...

1506
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,080
- We have a problem.

1507
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:46,448
- Guess again.

1508
01:19:46,514 --> 01:19:50,119
- He was unsure
there would be an engagement.

1509
01:19:50,184 --> 01:19:52,888
I think you should definitely
kick him in the.

1510
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:54,223
You don't deserve this.

1511
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,493
- You changed your story
so many times. I'm done.

1512
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:59,537
- I know that there's still
somebody involved in this.

1513
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:01,063
- Why are you yelling at me?

1514
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:02,331
You told me things,

1515
01:20:02,398 --> 01:20:05,501
and then you went back
against what you said.

1516
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:07,068
I want this to work.

1517
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:09,071
I've given him
nothing but the best.

1518
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:12,775
- - I just, like...
I want to date you.

1519
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:14,209
Getting engaged
before that happens

1520
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:16,011
is not how things usually go.

1521
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:18,280
- I feel like
I'm so sick of this.

1522
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:19,748
What am I supposed to do?

1523
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,885
Walk away because
he's not ready to propose?

1524
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:26,355
Makes me feel that I'm,
like, unlovable.

1525
01:20:26,422 --> 01:20:28,957
- You're lying
straight to my face.

1526
01:20:29,023 --> 01:20:32,861
I want an answer
for why you did what you did.

1527
01:20:32,928 --> 01:20:37,800
- The shocking, live finale
of "The Bachelorette"

1528
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:41,804
starts next Tuesday night.

1529
01:20:43,105 --> 01:20:44,473
- In Amsterdam.

1530
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:46,075
That artwork was European,
right?

1531
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:47,643
It wasn't from America.
- Mm-mm.

1532
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:50,079
1600s.

1533
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:52,614
- Is that the Renaissance?

1534
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:55,150
- Yes.

1535
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:56,952
I believe so.

1536
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:58,730
Are you a history...
Are you a history buff?

1537
01:20:58,754 --> 01:21:01,123
- I really like history.
- Yeah.

1538
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:05,127
- But I don't know
like time periods.

1539
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:07,096
- Yeah.

1540
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:09,798
- All I know is I look like
every kid in those pictures.

1541
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,443
- I don't even know
where you're getting that.

1542
01:21:11,467 --> 01:21:13,102
- Tell me I do not.

1543
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:14,436
- Every single one of them?

1544
01:21:14,503 --> 01:21:17,505
- I was reincarnated
from a Renaissance child.

1545
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:19,308
- Not even...
Not even a little bit.

1546
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:20,876
Not even a little bit.

1547
01:21:20,943 --> 01:21:22,186
- I looked at the kid, I'm like,

1548
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,988
that's how I see myself
in the mirror every day.

1549
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:25,781
- Stop.

1550
01:21:25,848 --> 01:21:29,550
- 16th century child.

1551
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:33,555
- I'm incredibly attracted
to a Renaissance child now,

1552
01:21:33,621 --> 01:21:34,556
I guess.

1553
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:35,958
Thanks for making it weird now.

1554
01:21:36,023 --> 01:21:38,827
- Never say that out loud again.

1555
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:42,130
You said...

1556
01:21:54,041 --> 01:21:55,411
- In Amsterdam.

1557
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:57,012
That artwork was European,
right?

1558
01:21:57,079 --> 01:21:58,580
It wasn't from America.
- Mm-mm.

1559
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:01,016
1600s.

1560
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:03,585
- Is that the Renaissance?

1561
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:06,088
- Yes.

1562
01:22:06,155 --> 01:22:07,889
I believe so.

1563
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:09,667
Are you a history...
Are you a history buff?

1564
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:12,059
- I really like history.
- Yeah.

1565
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:16,064
- But I don't know
like time periods.

1566
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:18,032
- Yeah.

1567
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,702
- All I know is I look like
every kid in those pictures.

1568
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,347
- I don't even know
where you're getting that.

1569
01:22:22,371 --> 01:22:24,039
- Tell me I do not.

1570
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:25,374
- Every single one of them?

1571
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:28,443
- I was reincarnated
from a Renaissance child.

1572
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:30,245
- Not even...
Not even a little bit.

1573
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:31,814
Not even a little bit.

1574
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,124
- I looked at the kid, I'm like,

1575
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:34,926
that's how I see myself
in the mirror every day.

1576
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,752
- Stop.

1577
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:40,489
- 16th century child.

1578
01:22:40,556 --> 01:22:44,493
- I'm incredibly attracted
to a Renaissance child now,

1579
01:22:44,559 --> 01:22:45,494
I guess.

1580
01:22:45,561 --> 01:22:46,895
Thanks for making it weird now.

1581
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:49,764
- Never say that out loud again.

1582
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:53,035
You said...

1583
01:22:53,059 --> 01:22:55,059
